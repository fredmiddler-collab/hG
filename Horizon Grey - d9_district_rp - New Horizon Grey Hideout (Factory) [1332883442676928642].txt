[1/25/2025 8:46 PM] Ghost
*Ghost entered the hideout, his gear still strapped to him. But his mind was elsewhere, heavily weighed down by Freddie's words. He made his way to his room, thoughts swirling as he tried to shake off the lingering tension.*


[1/25/2025 9:03 PM] Cole Mercer
*Once inside his room, Cole shut the door and locked it behind him. He moved toward his desk, methodically removing his gear and weapons, placing each one in its rightful place. Only his pants remained, his muscular frame now exposed. He sat down, interlocking his fingers and staring at the ground in silence, lost in thought.*


[1/25/2025 9:11 PM] Cole Mercer
*Not to mention, Cole's mask lay on the bed beside him, its presence immediate the moment his gaze shifted. He stared at it, his thoughts replaying Freddie's words on a loop...*
# **You already had a tracker on you, so I reverse-engineered it. Hang around the girl for a while, and I'll see to it I return the favor.**

# **You already had a tracker on you.**

# **You already had a tracker.**

# **Tracker.**

*A tracker. That was what **bothered** him the most. Who could’ve planted it? He knew it must’ve been during a moment of vulnerability, perhaps when he was unconscious or sleeping. The last time he’d blacked out was before the raid on the CCR police station in Fairview—no, before that. It was the raid on his apartment, right after he’d passed out. Paige had taken him in. But he had been out cold for some time. The __only person__ who could’ve pulled this off effortlessly was—*

*Cole’s eyes narrowed, his expression turning stern. His fingers stopped interlocking and transformed into **tight fists.** He knew it was best to keep this to himself for now. The priority was getting out of the district. To do that, he needed upgrades—plenty of them.*

A message was sent to him, the sender. The identity remained a mystery. It was a person he had never saved contact with, yet somehow, they possessed his UUID. How could someone have such personal information?

It has only 17 hours since he left for Fred's house, and Fred is already calling the shots.

As long as he gets what he needs, it will appear that Ghost will do whatever it takes.

Cole did not receive a message for over an hour.

`"Four occupants: Mathias, Paige, Kode, and netrunner Cat Bayes. Mathias and Paige are compromised, no threat. Address: 94 Smeaton Road, Kapea. Updates to follow."`

[1/26/2025 6:15 PM] Narration
Cole stepped out of his room, the heavy door creaking softly behind him as he entered the hallway. A hush enveloped the space, broken only by the occasional groan of the aging structure that served as their makeshift home. To his immediate right, a row of doors led to repurposed storage rooms, their contents shrouded in shadow and mystery. The hallway there abruptly ended, creating a sense of confinement.

To the left, the corridor stretched onward, flanked by a series of eclectic rooms, each with secrets hidden behind closed doors. The air held a faint hint of dust and metal, a reminder of the factory's industrial past. At the far end of the hall, Cole could see a four-way intersection waiting to be explored.

If he ventured left, he would enter the factory's uncharted territory, an area he had yet to thoroughly investigate. Straight ahead beckoned the facility's heart, where the gaping sinkhole loomed ominously. This path also led to the large warehouse bay doors, allowing vehicles to enter and exit, the facility's power generating room, and the front of the facility, which had the front entrance. However, the front entrance was caved in.

To the right, the path wound towards Kode's domain and various workshops. Tools and equipment dotted the area.


[1/26/2025 6:45 PM] Ghost
*Ghost moved, scanning his surroundings as he began exploring the factory. His steps were slow but deliberate, his eyes sharp, noting every detail of the environment. He made his way toward the **storage rooms**, each one a potential repository of something useful. Perhaps amidst the dust and neglect, he could uncover something of value?*


[1/26/2025 7:03 PM] Narration
The storage rooms held many abandoned or broken items. Most of the inventory consisted of civilian tools, including wrenches, pliers, Allen keys, and fasteners. A few crates were carried over from their previous base of operations; these contained ammunition but no weapons.


[1/26/2025 7:06 PM] Ghost
*Ghost exited the storage room and turned left, heading toward the **electric rooms.** The closed doors along this corridor remained unexplored, and now seemed like the right time to uncover what lay behind them.*


[1/26/2025 7:11 PM] Narration
Ghost entered the electric rooms and found nothing of value aside from a shard covered in dust particles. It was abandoned, and its contents could hold anything from a program that could enhance his abilities, some virus that hijacks his neural functions, or a data drive with some videos or documents for him to rummage through. It's not a good idea to slot it in, especially when you don't know what it will do.


[1/26/2025 7:14 PM] Ghost
*Ghost decided to pick up the shard, planning to inspect it later when the time was right. He exited the electric room and continued down the hallway toward the intersection. Upon reaching it, he glanced to his **left,** realising it was an area he hadn’t explored before. Without hesitation, he made up his mind and ventured in that direction.*


[1/26/2025 7:32 PM] Narration
Ghost traversed the hallway, identical to every other hallway except that there were exit signs further down the hall. A few doors were before the end of the hall, where the exit sign was. One to his immediate right.


[1/26/2025 7:34 PM] Ghost
*Immediate right it was. In fact, he was trying to move quickly, so he approached the door and opened it abruptly, almost like a father trying to catch his son watching porn.*

[1/26/2025 7:49 PM] Cat Bayes
*The first thing Ghost would've noticed was that it was kinda chilly in this room! The subtle ambience of servers humming and beeping filled the air while the dim, neon blue lights of a holographic screen illuminated a cluttered work desk. Hung haphazardly on an old truss system attached to the ceiling appeared to be a camera that was focusing in on the man, while some speakers at the aforementioned desk popped to life.*

```fix
"Yo."
```

*It was Cat's voice! As for the netrunner herself, if the mercenary was to look further back into the room...She was there, laying limply in an ice bath while a number of thick cables were plugged into a port in the back of her head. Also she was uh...ahem, naked.*

[1/26/2025 7:58 PM] Ghost
*Ghost stood there in silence for a minute, taking in everything observable in the room. However, he **slowly** stepped back and **slowly** attempted to close the door without breaking eye contact with Cat nor uttering a word.*


[1/26/2025 8:03 PM] Cat Bayes
```fix
"So uh, guessing you're here about the tracker, huh?"
```

*Ah, so it seems like Cat was aware that __something__ happened to the tracker. There was obvious guilt in her voice, but the cameras attached to the truss system above were keeping a __careful__ eye on the man.*

```fix
"You're probably super pissed about it, which is understandable, I'd be pissed too."
```

*She continued to speak, the crackle of the speakers sometimes breaking up her words, but it was just clear enough for Ghost to understand what she was saying.*

```fix
"Soo...yeah, I'm sorry man..."
```


[1/26/2025 8:10 PM] Ghost
*Just before Ghost closed the door, he listened to Cat. It was hard to gauge what he was thinking or feeling, as he was often unreadable, but he had enough decency to let her finish speaking before shutting the door.

He didn’t have much to say in that moment, his mind was elsewhere...*


[1/26/2025 8:19 PM] Cat Bayes
```fix
"Oh, for fucks sake, this apology sucks ass! Gimme a second..."
```

*Her groan was quite audible through the speaker, clearly upset over something. A few beeps and bops, and the sound of a fan whirring to life before gradually fading away again, and-*

# HISSSSS...

*Cat's fingers twitched before her arm lifted itself up to her head. She wrapped her fingers around the base of the cable plugged into the back of her head before finally sliding it out to let it hang from the ceiling. Standing up, the netrunner didn't even bother to cover herself as she leaned her ass against the edge of the tub, rubbing her arms as she stared at Ghost with guilt in her eyes.*

[1/26/2025 8:21 PM] Ghost
*He closed the door.*


[1/26/2025 8:27 PM] Cat Bayes
**"..."** *She watched as he closed the door in silence for a moment, before breathing a sigh and raising her hand to the back of her head, her fingers gliding along the metallic surface of her neural port.* **"Not sure how I feel about the 'I'm gonna kill you' vibes you're giving off, but I probably deserve it, so...fair."**

*It wasn't easy holding a conversation with him before, but now Cat was struggling to come up with anything to say, especially given the fact that he hasn't spoken a word since entering her room.*


[1/26/2025 8:28 PM] Ghost
*With everything else noted, he made his way back to the intersection...*


[1/26/2025 8:29 PM] Narration
It became evident that the surrounding rooms were likely more than just empty spaces; they could each serve as dwellings in the lives of those who once inhabited them. Beyond these chambers loomed the exit doors. A set of double doors stood prominently ahead. Must be the back entrance.


[1/26/2025 8:31 PM] Cat Bayes
*...Cool, way to go, Cat. Ghost could hear the muffled sound of her loudly groaning behind the door.*
-# "Uuuuggggghhhh!"

{Reactions}
🤨 (2)

[1/26/2025 8:32 PM] Ghost
*Ghost kept his eye on the double doors for a few brief seconds, noting the **back entrance.** It could prove useful for an old man with intentions of killing someone. With that in mind, he decided to check out Kode's office and its surroundings.*


[1/26/2025 8:44 PM] Narration
Ghost turned around and headed down the hallway toward Kode's office.


[1/26/2025 8:44 PM] Kode
Upon arriving, he saw Kode at his desk, drinking from what appeared to be an alcoholic beverage bottle. His eyes flicked over towards Ghost momentarily before setting his bottle down. **"Hmm? Oh— You're still breathing. Interesting development, if I do say so."** He remarked, twisting the cap back to the drink. **"Got any upgrades you need installed?"** Asking Cole as he turned his attention towards __Dylan__.


[1/26/2025 8:44 PM] Dylan Hackett
Dylan was awake and appeared to be well. Sitting upon his observation table. Several monitors were wired up to her body. Evaluating her vitals. Her eyes locked onto Ghost's mask with an uneasy expression. **". . ."**


[1/26/2025 8:46 PM] Ghost
*Ghost shifted his gaze between the two briefly before focusing back on Kode. He disregarded everything else, first scanning the room and noting anything that might be useful. Then, he walked up to Kode and handed him the **shard** he had found earlier.* **"Check if this is safe to insert."**


[1/26/2025 8:56 PM] Kode
He would pick it up, twisting his fingers to inspect both sides. **"Hmph. It's older, I can tell you that much just by looking at it."** He would wheel his chair towards a device he purchased. It was slim and had holographic projector on the top. There was a slot along the height of the device which he slotted the shard in. **"Let's have a look."**


[1/26/2025 8:58 PM] Kode
He'd begin anaylzing the shard's data. It's make, the model, and a host of other data fields. **"Looks like someone used this shard as a drive to hold seperate file instances. I don't see any viruses on i—"** He would stop talking, leaning in as he started to pay more attention to what he was looking at.


[1/26/2025 9:02 PM] Kode
**"It's a drive containing a fragmented map."** He'd declared after inspecting it for a few minutes. **"An underground map regarding the water treatment plant and its pipeline networks beneath the facility."** Ejecting the shard, he would set it on the table. **"It's safe."**


[1/26/2025 9:02 PM] Kode
**"Mathias and Paige would be interested in that. Bring it to their attention once they are feeling better."**


[1/26/2025 9:05 PM] Ghost
*Ghost pocketed the shard. He nodded slowly and said,* **"Right."** *He glanced at Dylan one last time before turning to leave the room. He had to report his findings.*


[1/26/2025 9:08 PM] Narration
Ghost was back out into the hallway. Kode's office door was now closed...


[1/26/2025 9:19 PM] Ghost
*He returned to his room. With everything noted, he sat down on his bed and began writing a full report to Freddie.*

`"I’ve gathered relevant information that can be of use to you. The back entrance is closest to Cat Bayes' room, where she’s working on her netrunning. It’s a strategic point of access if you need a quiet exit or entry. I also came across a shard containing a fragmented map of the underground water treatment plant and its pipelines. Kode ran a quick check—no issues with it, and it’s safe to use. Paige and Mathias are still recovering, so they’re out of action for now. Kode is still in his office, doing whatever it is he does. All this information could be useful down the line, depending on how things unfold. Keep it in mind."`


[1/26/2025 9:29 PM] Narration
10 minutes elapsed, then he received a response.
`"Noted."`


[1/26/2025 9:36 PM] Cole Mercer
*Cole removed his mask, placing it beside his pillow. The door he had come through was shut and locked—he was safe, for now. He interlocked his fingers once again, resuming the same sitting position as before. His mind lingered on the consequences of his actions, but tonight had solidified one thing: **nobody here could be trusted,** especially after what Cat had done to him.* 

`"I can't stay here any longer. It's time to prepare to leave. This shard might be the only thing that gets me out of this."`

It was late in the night when Cole received another message...


[1/27/2025 7:49 PM] Cole Mercer
*He was about to fall asleep, but it seemed rest wasn’t an option tonight. He checked the message.*


[1/27/2025 7:52 PM] Narration
`"Get close to Paige, do not make contact. I need to verify some information. If she is sleep, great."` Was what the message read.


[1/27/2025 7:55 PM] Cole Mercer
*Cole let out a low grunt and suited up, slipping back into his gear and mask. He walked over to his desk, grabbing his dual handguns and ice pick—just in case.*


[1/27/2025 7:55 PM] Ghost
*Whatever the old man's obsession with Paige was, Ghost didn’t bother asking questions. He made his move.*


[1/27/2025 8:01 PM] Narration
The factory hallway lights remained on as to deter the Purafish advancement to the ground level. Though, during this time of night, it was deafeningly quiet.


[1/27/2025 8:03 PM] Ghost
*Ghost's footsteps echoed through the deafening silence as he moved, steadily making his way closer to Paige's room.*


[1/27/2025 8:19 PM] Narration
Nothing popped out, nothing moved, nothing even shuffled as he closed in on her bedroom door...


[1/27/2025 8:20 PM] Ghost
*Ghost took a risk, slowly easing the door open, inch by inch. **Very... very slowly.***


[1/27/2025 8:28 PM] Narration
The room was dark, as the light sliced through the space. He could see a lump in the bed. The blanket obscuring most of Paige's frame aside from the back of her head. Her hair hanging off the side of the bed.  Just before the bed was a small portable table with medications scattered about its surface. Most certainly Immunosuppressants and painkillers.


[1/27/2025 8:35 PM] Ghost
*Ghost slowly stepped into the room, edging closer for a better look.*


[1/27/2025 8:47 PM] Narration
Ghost was hovering over here, side stepping the table. A moment passed and then he received another message. `"Received. You've kept your word, so I'll keep mine. Send me the details about this 'mask'."`


[1/27/2025 8:54 PM] Ghost
*Ghost shot back a quick reply,* `"Keep you updated."` *He then turned and headed toward the door...*


[1/28/2025 6:07 PM] Narration
The following day unfolded slowly for Cat and Cole, marked by a peculiar stillness that seemed to stretch endlessly. As the clock’s hands converged at 10:30, Ghost was already wide awake in his dimly lit room. The overhead lights cast a soft glow on the assortment of weapons and gear meticulously arranged on his rumpled bed. Each piece shimmered faintly in the light, reflecting the white light.


[1/28/2025 6:15 PM] Cole Mercer
*Cole had his duffle bag ready, packed with a kinetic assault rifle, a box of smoke grenades, impact grenades, and an array of melee weapons, including a variety of knives. His dual handguns were already holstered, his upper body wrapped in bandages like in the old days, and he donned a tattered hooded cloak reminiscent of his former outfit. Slinging the duffle bag over his shoulder, **he was ready.***

*He walked over to his bed, leaving his mask behind on the pillow. Without a second glance, he stepped out of his room and made his way toward the glory hole.*

[1/28/2025 6:27 PM] Cat Bayes
*Okay, try number fourteen! Cat had been coming and going to Ghost's door for the better half of the day now to offer a more sincere apology to the man, but uh...evidently, she hadn't been able to land on anything. But hey, she got something now! She was about to round the corner and watch as her confidence shatter and crumble into a million pieces before...*

*The blue haired asian girl immediately stepped back from the corner, the sound of the opening door alerting the skittish Cat. Peeking her head into the adjacent hallway, she watched as Ghost - maskless - had left his room and was on his way in the opposite direction.* **"...?"** *She could go deliver her apology to him now, but the curse of the cat's curiosity had struck once again. Where was he going?*

*This definitely won't help her relationship with him, but she just...has to know. For the time being, Cat began to shadow Ghost from a fair distance.*


[1/28/2025 6:31 PM] Cole Mercer
*Cole came to a halt, glancing down into the hole where he had once fought a monster. Wasting no time, he quickly and carefully began his descent.*


[1/28/2025 6:37 PM] Cat Bayes
*A few seconds later, and Cat walked out from her hiding position, squinting her eyes at the hole she watched him jump down. Isn't that the hole with the giant murder fish? Weren't they all gonna go take that on as a team - why is he going down there by himself? Once again, the irony of her curiosity was on full display, and the netrunner just couldn't help herself.*

*This was her first time approaching the ~~glory~~ hole, but it was every bit as intimidating as the others made it out to be. Leaning over to peek in - fuck, that was a long drop - she couldn't see any sign of the man...meaning he was dead set on making his way through it. Man, she really just go back and tell the others, huh?*

*...Cat, why are you sitting on the edge of the creepy murder hole like you're about to -* **"Tsk!"** *- annnnnd she jumped in.*


[1/28/2025 6:44 PM] Cole Mercer
*It was a long walk, and Cole occasionally checked his surroundings, his back, left, and right. His duffle bag was slightly unzipped, giving him quick access to his box of impact grenades. In his other hand, he held a flashlight, guiding his way as he moved steadily closer to his **destination.***


[1/28/2025 6:49 PM] Cat Bayes
*After that...super graceful landing, Cat had managed to catch up with the mercenary and was just barely keeping him in sight. The way things are, there's no way she wants to get caught following him. Everytime he looked like he was about to turn around, Cat __immediately__ huddled herself into a nook or behind a barrel - fuck it reeked in here!*


[1/28/2025 6:52 PM] Cole Mercer
*She was a sneaky one... Cole hadn’t spotted her yet. He moved closer and closer to his destination, finally reaching a ladder leading up to a manhole. Carefully, he began his ascent, temporarily slipping out of Cat’s sight—depending on how __close__ she was to him.*


[1/28/2025 6:57 PM] Cat Bayes
*Ghost indeed had slipped out of Cat's sight temporarily, but she __did__ watch as he climbed the ladder! Waiting a few seconds after his feet had cleared the final rung, she finally approached the ladder - double checking to see if he was still up there - before slowly climbinb up herself.*

*Cole made sure to shut the manhole behind him, momentarily occupied on the surface. But what exactly was he doing up there...?*


[1/28/2025 7:06 PM] Cat Bayes
*Did he seriously close the manhole after him? Fucker!*

*Internally groaning to herself, she weighed the option of pressing against the manhole cover to peek outside and potentially getting caught. After a moment or two of agonizing internal fighting, she finally decided to just __barely__ push the front of the lid up, just enough for her eyes to clear the opening.*

*She had to see where the man was going.*


[1/28/2025 7:09 PM] Cole Mercer
*What Cat witnessed was an unexpected turn of events. She saw Cole rummaging through a pile of bin bags, tossing some to the side, others backward, until he finally uncovered a strange-looking box. Carefully lifting it up, his hands firmly tightened around the corners.*


[1/28/2025 7:11 PM] Cat Bayes
*What...the fuck? Did he seriously travel all this way through fucking __Purafish__ territory to go dumpster diving? Nah, he didn't seem like that type of guy.*

*But seriously, what the fuck was he doing? Cat squinted as him as she continued to watch events unfold.*

*As soon as Cole confirmed the contents of the box...*
# !
*His head snapped to the left, his eyes locking onto the slightly tilted manhole. Did he just spot someone?!*


[1/28/2025 7:18 PM] Cat Bayes
*NO, NO HE DIDN'T!*

*With __fucking__ haste, Cat dropped down the ladder - once again falling on her ass - leaving the cover closed as she __ran__ back the way she came! The moment she found a nook to hide behind, she took it and slammed her back into it, sliding down onto her ass.*

*fuckfuckfuckfuckfuckfuckfuckfuckfuckfuckfuckfuckfuckfuckfuckfuckfuck...*

# *Ghost dropped down...*
*landing on the hard ground with a loud thud that echoed through the space, **a clear signal of his descent.** His handguns were drawn, and something about him felt... different. There was an intensity in his movements, a shift in his presence that was impossible to ignore.*

*Without hesitation, Ghost began to move. His footsteps echoed in the silence, **quickening** with each step until they turned into a **full sprint.** It was as if he knew exactly where to go. His destination was clear,**__ the water treatment facility.__***

[1/28/2025 7:37 PM] Cat Bayes
*Her breath hitched in her throat when she heard the heavy thud of his boots land and shake the cold ground she was sitting on. She tried her best to keep as still as possible, less he somehow heard the slight ruffling of her worn down shoes against the concrete, before...*

*He was moving, but not in her direction? Shit, he was moving __quick__! With a deep sigh to calm her nerves, she leaned out of her hiding spot and gazed down the tunnel...no sight of him, but she could definitely still __hear__ him. If she wanted to figure out what this man was doing, she needed to keep pace with him! Scrambling to her feet, she gave chase!*


[1/28/2025 7:42 PM] Narration
The labyrinth stretched endlessly, a tangled network of pipes twisting and weaving with no discernible pattern or direction. After what felt like an eternity of wandering, the narrow corridors suddenly opened up into a vast underground chamber. The air here was heavy and cool, carrying the faint metallic tang of damp machinery. The roar of cascading water echoed through the space, its sound amplified by the cavernous walls. A fine mist hung in the air, refracting the dim light from flickering overhead lamps and casting shifting shadows on the moss-covered brickwork.

A canal ran through the center of the chamber, its turbulent waters rushing past with relentless force before vanishing into the darkness. Rusted railings lined its edges, groaning softly under the weight of corrosion. The scene was dominated by the remnants of an old water treatment facility, its purpose long forgotten. Machinery that had once roared with life now stood still, coated in grime and rust. Crumbling brick walls bore the weight of corroded metal beams, while shattered gears and fractured valves lay scattered across the floor, silent witnesses to the passage of time.

Yet, there was a faint hum in the air, a low vibration that suggested life—or at least, power. The facility’s ancient systems flickered and sputtered, glowing faintly with the energy restored to it from above. Cat’s efforts to bring electricity back to the surface seemed to have awakened this place, giving it a faint, ghostly semblance of its former purpose. The overhead lamps buzzed and swayed slightly, their flickering light cutting through the mist and revealing glimpses of forgotten mechanisms waiting in the shadows. Near the canal was the body of the **Purafish** Cole had killed a while back. Its carcass was rotting. 

Beyond the canal was where the map pointed in the direction of Monita and **one** route leading out. All that was left was to follow the canal.


[1/28/2025 7:44 PM] Narration
When cat arrived to the water facility... Cole was nowhere to be found.


[1/28/2025 7:44 PM] Narration
Forward seemed to be the most logical, since he would have had to climbed several stories to get to the other tunnels.


[1/28/2025 7:50 PM] Cat Bayes
*Even with all the extraneous activity Cat's been getting up to nowadays, that was still quite the hike! Finding the nearest and safest looking spot to hide behind, she took a moment to catch her breath before taking a look from behind her cover. Great, __now__ where the fuck did he go? The man was nowhere in sight, and she didn't want to step out in case it was a trap.*

*Glancing down at the shore of the canal, she noticed the rotting corpse of the Purafish lying there, lifeless. Euck.*

*Well, besides losing the appetite she'd just worked up, there was nothing left to do but activate her cyberdeck in a last ditch attempt to locate Ghost...*


[1/28/2025 7:57 PM] Narration
Scanlines emerged from Cat's origin and spanned outwards, pinging off of old equipment that created noise in this metallic jungle. As they plunged into the darkness, the contours of the canal was made visible. A disrupted signature was seen deep in the darkness of the canal, but gave no readings. Jamming? The signal distored and blurred, meaning, whatever it was, was on the move, away from Cat.


[1/28/2025 8:00 PM] Cat Bayes
*The equipment in this musty old room wasn't capable of disrupting her scans like that - especially with the upgrades she got recently - so there was only one thing that could be causing that: Ghost's mask.*

*But...hold on, didn't he leave that thing back at HQ? Maybe it was on his person but he wasn't wearing it at the time? None of this was adding up to her, and the desire the know more only festered from the lack of information she had. Knowing damn well she could be sitting comfy in her ice bath back at base, she decided to take another breath of sewage air and got back to trekking after Ghost.*


[1/28/2025 8:06 PM] Narration
Cat pressed on through the digital wilderness, each step pulling her further into the depths of the signal that pulsed like a living entity. The landscape shifted around her, pixels morphing and colliding as she descended deeper into the vast network. Waves of indecipherable binary wrapped around her, a cacophony of ones and zeros swirling in chaotic patterns. It felt as if she were stepping into the heart of a sentient creation, one that had evolved far beyond anything she’d encountered before.

This was not just any intrusion; it was a next-generation ICE, a firewall that had transcended basic security measures to become something almost alive. The deeper she ventured, the more her surroundings became distorted—data streams flickering and writhing as if they sought to flee her approach. The once-familiar terrain of the net morphed into a bizarre labyrinth, its walls glitching and shimmering with the intensity of reactive algorithms.

As the ice continued to be traced, Cat felt a palpable tension in the air, a sense of foreboding that sent chills down her spine. Digital tendrils reached out, bending the fabric of the virtual world, and she could feel the relentless grip of the signal tightening around her. With each passing moment, the insidious code swirled in upon itself, seeking to consume her wholly, until she felt herself being engulfed—swallowed by the intricate web of self-replicating data that threatened to devour her consciousness. 

Then, it cleared like glass to a rock... The bright digital world broke away into the darkness once more.


[1/28/2025 8:07 PM] Ghost
*Just before she could act on her next move, Cat felt the cold muzzle of a gun press against the back of her skull.*

*His form materialized from the shadows, the camera panning upward from his boots… to his...*

# **Mask.**

*Ghost’s __red__, glaring eyes locked onto her, his **Midnight Edge** trained with deadly precision. His towering frame cast a heavy shadow over her as he spoke, his voice __cold__ and __unwavering.__*

 **"You’ve been following me."**

[1/28/2025 8:24 PM] Cat Bayes
**"Cause I haven't given you my apology yet."** *Cat's voice was far calmer than it should've been in this case. Honestly, that was just the first thing that came to her mind and out of her mouth.*

*Inside, she was a panicking mess, her mind trying to string together a way out of this mess her curiosity put her in - oh is that where the saying comes from?*

*Fucks sake, CAT! FOCUS!*


[1/28/2025 8:30 PM] Ghost
*Ghost shifted the barrel slightly to the right, grazing her ear. **Without hesitation, he pulled the trigger, one shot fired, narrowly missing her on purpose.** Without a second glance, he moved forward, completely disregarding the tension he’d just put Cat through.*


[1/28/2025 8:38 PM] Cat Bayes
**"FUCK, AH!"** *She quickly brought her hand up to her ringing ear as she recoiled from the gunshot, falling over! Blood rushed to her head and adrenaline kicked in, her vision blurring and...there was a warm liquid dripping from her ear canal. That's gonna take a fucking while to heal.*

*Glancing upwards, she noticed Ghost beginning to walk away. At the last minute, she blurted out-* **"Ghost! F-Fuck, ah..."** *That didn't sound right, and it wasn't because she couldn't hear out of her right ear - barely out of her left. It was just __wrong.__*

**"Cole, wait!"** *For the first time since the prison raid, Cat had called him by his actual name.*

[1/28/2025 8:44 PM] Cat Bayes
**"Ggh!"** *Fuck, he was still walking! Stop, stop for fucks sake and listen!* **"Would you wait for a second?! Cole!"**

*Cat got up, pressing her hand against the wall as she staggered alongside it, trying her best to keep up.* **"I-I'm sorry, okay?! I know I fucked up, I shouldn't have put the tracker on you! I thought I was protecting my family but-"** *No, that's no excuse, Cat. You know better.*

**"I didn't realize how it would hurt you, at the time."** *She sighed, still taking a step forward but slowing down.* **"Flaws and all, you're part of my family too now, and I should've done better to protect you. I know it's too late to ask for your forgiveness but-"**

# Family?
*Ghost came to an __abrupt halt,__ the word echoing in his ears. He didn’t turn around, but his head subtly shifted toward Cat’s direction. He stood there, motionless, his red eyes cutting through the darkness.*
# Part of a family?
*Did he hear that right? His mind raced, confusion washing over him. He didn’t understand. **No,** he didn’t __want__ to understand. Not now. He had to leave. He couldn’t stay with them any longer, __especially not after what he had done.__*
# I should've done better to protect you.
*He shook his head, trying to clear the thoughts, but they kept coming. What had driven her to go through all of this? What had pushed her this far? With a final, resigned look, he turned his gaze forward and resumed walking, his steps __heavy__ as he moved onward.*

Little did they realize the unforeseen consequences of their actions as the bullet Cole fired off struck a partially obscured high-voltage transformer housing. Surprisingly, it didn’t ignite; power was not routed in that direction then. The generators at the water treatment facility operated cyclically, powering up and down every hour to effectively manage wastewater flow rates throughout the complex. With the conflict not impacting that powered area yet, the generators continued their routine undisturbed.

However, half an hour had passed since 10:30, and the clock now read **11:00**. As the generator whirred to life, it began reallocating power down the canal where the two individuals were navigating. Suddenly, as the electricity surged through the wires now compromised by the earlier incident, a violent explosion erupted from the transformer. A cacophony of sound accompanied the brilliant flash of sparks that illuminated the darkness—a harbinger of the chaos that followed.

The blaring of alarms pierced the moldy and moist air as crimson warning lights ignited, flooding the surroundings with an ominous glow. Moments later, a safety barrier descended with a thunderous clang, sealing off their route back to the Water Treatment Facility. The heavy solid cast iron wall slammed down with finality into the canal's murky waters, trapping them in the dimly lit corridor, with only uncertainty and shadows ahead.


[1/28/2025 9:11 PM] Cat Bayes
*Cat had gone silent after watching as Cole walked off, her body slumped over as she fell to her knees. She didn't want to lose him, __too__, and it was her fault...__again__. Why does she keep screwing up like this? Why does she keep losing her family?!*

*She was just about to call Kode, before the blinding flash of light and muffled sound of the transformer exploding brought her back to her senses. The chaos that ensued forced the girl to cover her ears, the ringing throbbing her skull putting her through an internal pain that had her gritting teeth.* **"Fuck, fuck!"** *She shouted, but her own words were drowned by the noise.*


[1/28/2025 9:14 PM] Narration
After a minute of alarm. It silenced, however, the red light remained on, creating a chaotic ambience of red.


[1/28/2025 9:15 PM] Narration
The alarm ended, but replacing it was the unappreciative neighborhood that had built a community down here... Screeching emerged in the silence... Cole was familiar with the sound, **Purafish.**

[1/28/2025 9:19 PM] Ghost
*Ghost came to a sudden halt, quickly scanning his surroundings, not out of panic, but to make sense of what had just happened. He took a step back, realizing the two of them were now... stuck together. For a brief moment, he looked down, silent, trying to process everything. Then…*
# He snapped.
*With a swift movement, he turned to face Cat. **It was her fault.** If she had just stopped following him—**if she had stayed out of his way**—none of this would have happened. **None of it.*** 

*Without warning, he sprinted toward her. As he closed the distance, he grabbed her by the neck, lifting her off the ground and slamming her against the wall.*
# *"You."*


[1/28/2025 9:22 PM] Cat Bayes
**"Kgh!"** *Once again, the wind was completely knocked out of Cat as she was choke slammed into the wall! With Ghost's fingers tightly clasping around her neck, she had no choice but weakly grab his wrist in an attempt to pry him off.*

-# "C-Coole..."

*She wheezed, limply kicking at his chest. Quickly losing what little oxygen she had left, she tried to grab at his mask in a last ditch effort to save herself.*


[1/28/2025 9:23 PM] Narration
The sound of water splashing was rapidly approaching them. Whatever it was that was coming, was coming quick!

*Ghost immediately released his grip. The mask snapped securely into place, tightened. As soon as he heard the footsteps, he activated his **__thermal vision.__** His bag was already unzipped, and he grabbed two impact grenades—six more remained in the box.*

# *He was waiting for the right moment...*

[1/28/2025 9:31 PM] Narration
Emerging from perpendicular tunnels further down the canal. Purafish came in droves. At least 6 of them were now rapidly approaching the two. They proceeded to race in their direction, climbing and falling over one another in a bid to reach their prey first. They were 40 yards out and closing!


[1/28/2025 9:35 PM] Cat Bayes
*Cat slid down the wall with a thud as her ass crashed against the ground, her hands going up to brace her neck as she broke out into a coughing fit. Blurry eyed, she looked over and spotted the silohuette of the purafish heading their way!* **"O-Oh you've gotta be shitting me!"** *She gasped, before coughing again.*

*She once again activated her cyberdeck, looking for whatever powered that door!*


[1/28/2025 9:35 PM] Ghost
*He hurled both impact grenades toward their direction, his thermal vision guiding his aim. As soon as the grenades were released, his hands swiftly reached for **two** more—__four__ remained in the box.*


[1/28/2025 9:49 PM] Narration
The door was not powered. A mechnaism where the door dropped from however was powered. It's sole purpose was to drop the door, making the door a dumb door. The mechanism however was shorting out due to the transformer. Making any attempts at reversing it **IMPOSSIBLE.**

The impact grenades struck true, the impact grenades were centered which allowed for equal distribution. The explosions led to a deafening roar from the fragmentation and flesh of the Purafish. The two in front lost the front half of themselves while to others lost a few limbs and parts of their massive bodies. Screeching in agony. This prompted the two who were in the rear to take the hint and fall back.

Before them lies four Purafish. Two of which were taking out and the other two were squirming around screeching.


[1/28/2025 9:57 PM] Cat Bayes
**"Fuck, no power for the door!"** *Think, Cat! While she was drawing up ideas to help them out of this situation, Cat began drawing her six-shot revolver from her back pocket. She wasn't sure if it'd be effective against those hell fish, but-*

*Wait, didn't Kode say something about those things before? That they were scared of- Her eyes glanced upwards to the dim, emergency lights casting everything in a red hue. Could she trace the power source for those things?*


[1/28/2025 9:59 PM] Ghost
*Ghost frantically launched one more grenade at the four Purafish in front of them, determined to take them out.*


[1/28/2025 10:01 PM] Narration
Power was coming from a transformer deeper into the tunnel. It was indeed accessible from Cat's distance! The first impact grenade took out the ones in the front immediately. Blowing them up into chunks! The second impact would land center, taking out the fifth one. The sixth Purafish escaping in an adjacent tunnel.


[1/28/2025 10:04 PM] Cat Bayes
*Bingo! Cat immediately sent a command to the transformer to reroute power back to the lights!*


[1/28/2025 10:09 PM] Narration
The low ambient lights then grew in intensity, enabling the two (Cole and Cat) to see further down the canal. That outta keep the remaining Purafish(s) away. For now...


[1/28/2025 10:11 PM] Cat Bayes
**"Huff...Huff..."** *The exhausted netrunner bumped the back of her head into the wall she was lying against, spitting off to her side.* **"...Fuck."**


[1/28/2025 10:12 PM] Ghost
*Ghost was breathing heavily, only **four** impact grenades remaining. It was time to pull out the big guns. He set his duffle bag on the ground, retrieving his assault rifle and gripping the handle tightly with his left hand. Once the rifle was in hand, he slung the duffle bag back over his shoulder and stepped forward, ready to continue...*

*She watched as he pulled the assault rifle from his bag, trying her best to pull herself up.* **"What...are you doing?"**


[1/28/2025 10:15 PM] Ghost
*Ghost paused for a brief moment, his eyes flickering toward the back. His voice, cold and steady, broke the silence.* **"I'm leaving."** *With that, he turned his gaze forward again and continued walking, each step firm on the ground as he moved away...*


[1/28/2025 10:18 PM] Cat Bayes
**"Leaving? To kill the Purafish?"** *Cat began to follow after him, her revolver still gripped tightly in her white-knuckled hands. The safety was on.* **"We have no idea how many are in there, you're gonna get yourself killed!"** *She tried to raise her voice, but it came out hoarse and far more quiet than she wanted it to be.* **"Let's go back to Horizon Grey, maybe Kode can help us or-"**


[1/28/2025 10:23 PM] Ghost
*Ghost kept moving forward, letting out a heavy sigh. His voice was low, cold.* **"Leaving for good."** *He had no intention of stopping—he needed to get out. There was no coming back to them, not after what he had done.*

*One more Purafish was still roaming around, but who knew how many more there were? It was uncertain how far Ghost could go alone with his limited resources. He spoke again, his tone firm.* **"I suggest you find a way back."**

[1/28/2025 10:28 PM] Cat Bayes
**"Wha- Why?!"** *That was a dumb question, she knew exactly why.* **"Look, I can't just leave you down here man! You-"** *She was cut off by a sudden coughing fit, the girl clearing her throat before she tried to continue.*

**"I'm the reason you're down here, right? Let me make this right, let me help you!"**


[1/28/2025 10:31 PM] Ghost
*Ghost came to a stop again, a rare pause in his relentless stride. Cat seemed to be the __only one__ capable of making him stop like this. He turned around, his rifle pointed downward, his red eyes locking onto hers with an intensity that felt like it pierced through her very soul.*

*He spoke, his voice cold, detached.*

**"No. It has nothing to do with you."**

*What was... Cole saying?*


[1/28/2025 10:34 PM] Cat Bayes
**"B-But...huh?"** *Now she was stumped, it had nothing to do with her? Then...what?* **"What are you saying? Cole, I...I broke your trust, that's not something I can..."** *She paused, her gaze cast downwards.*

**"I don't want...to lose another member of my family."** *Cat muttered, a deep pain welling in her throat.* **"Can't we go back? There's still time to make this right, I-"**


[1/28/2025 10:39 PM] Ghost
*Ghost let out a long, **heavy sigh.** The hand holding the rifle began to __tremble__ slightly, his mind spiraling once again. He lowered his gaze, unable to meet Cat’s eyes.*
# *What was happening to him?*
*For a moment, **hesitation** laced his voice. He responded, his tone unsteady.* **"Why... Why do you think we're..."** *He shook his head, frustration and confusion mounting.* **"You’ve got it mixed up, Cat."**

*Cat. He... he had called her Cat?*


[1/28/2025 10:48 PM] Cat Bayes
**"Yeah, I probably do...I'm an emotional idiot like that."** *Cat took a step closer to him. She heard Cole call her by her name for the first time, and her expression softened. There was no wise-cracking jokes from her this time, but a somber vulnerability that she wasn't that used to showing around other people.* **"Look, I know there's no such thing as a *good* person in District 9, and you certainly don't fit the bill..."**

**"At least, that's what I thought for a while, but..."** *She gave him another look, before sighing.* **"...I don't think you're 100% a bad guy, and you uh...kinda grew on me."**


[1/28/2025 10:51 PM] Cat Bayes
**"So it'd uh...It would kinda suck if you got yourself killed because of me...to a fish."**


[1/28/2025 10:52 PM] Ghost
**"You’re making this difficult..."** *Ghost turned his head away for a moment, a rare flicker of vulnerability breaking through, __even with his mask on.__ His hand stopped trembling, and he spoke again, his voice colder.* **"I’ve done something. Something you won’t forgive me for."**


[1/28/2025 10:54 PM] Cat Bayes
**"So have I-"** *She paused, processing his words.* **"Wait...wh-what did you do?"**


[1/28/2025 10:59 PM] Ghost
*Ghost snapped back, the words cutting through the silence that followed. It was just him and Cat now, no one else to hear. __His tone was detached, colder than ever.__* **"I sold you guys out."** *His red glare intensified.*

[1/28/2025 11:00 PM] Cat Bayes
**"..."** *That shut her up real good, the anger starting to rise in chest as well.* **"...To who...?"**

*A few moments of silence, and she stepped forward.* **"TO FUCKING WHO!?"**


[1/28/2025 11:03 PM] Ghost
*Ghost __slowly raised__ his rifle, the barrel aimed in Cat's direction. The silence stretched between them, heavy and suffocating, but it didn’t last long. He finally spoke, his voice flat and cold.*
# "Freddie Dawson."


[1/28/2025 11:05 PM] Cat Bayes
**"..."**


[1/28/2025 11:07 PM] Cat Bayes
*There was an unbearable silence for the longest time from Cat, her bangs hiding her emotions from the man.*

*Then, she started walking to him, slowly and methodical...each of her steps calculated. By the time she stopped, the end of his rifle was just barely grazing her chest, and that's where she continued to stand.*

*Until she reeled her fist back, and punched him in the chest. It was weak, and it barely even moved him.*


[1/28/2025 11:08 PM] Ghost
# ". . ."


[1/28/2025 11:10 PM] Cat Bayes
*She did it again, and again, and again.*

*There was no strength behind them at all, but Ghost could hear sniffling from her.* **"You're such...a fucking idiot...even more than me."**


[1/28/2025 11:11 PM] Ghost
*Ghost remained silent, **letting it all happen** without a word. He made no effort to stop Cat. Yet, behind that mask, it was impossible to tell what he was thinking—or if he felt anything at all.*


[1/28/2025 11:14 PM] Cat Bayes
*After the sixth or seventh punch, she finally stopped. She'd left her fist resting against the cold metal plate of his armored chest.*

*Ghost—no. The mask was gone. **For the first time in his life,** Cole willingly let someone get close enough to remove it. What Cat saw beneath...*

*A single tear traced down his right cheek, yet his expression remained rigid, unmoving. The reason he had been silent all this time...*  
# Was because he felt sorrow.

[1/28/2025 11:26 PM] Cole Mercer
*Cole remained still, his mind racing with countless thoughts. He didn’t understand why, but he let it happen—**he just let it happen.***


[1/28/2025 11:29 PM] Cat Bayes
**"...We can fix this, Cole."** *She muttered softly, keeping her arms wrapped around him.* **"I don't know how the others are gonna respond when they find out, but there's still a chance for us to fix this."**


[1/28/2025 11:33 PM] Cole Mercer
*Cole let out a quiet sigh, unable to find the right words. Instead, he gave a slow, deliberate nod. This time, Cat was taking the lead. No—not just her. They both were, **together.***

*After a brief silence, he finally spoke.* **"Let's… move."**


[1/28/2025 11:41 PM] Cat Bayes
**"...Yeah."** *Cat agreed, finally pulling away from their hug.*

*Wiping away her tears, she looked around the area they were stuck in. The door to that lead to their way back had closed, and they didn't have a lot of options.*


[1/28/2025 11:41 PM] Narration
There was silence.... Then,
## BANG..... ##
-# clank...

Something fell in the canal forward, distant and foreboding. They, indeed, weren't alone in these tunnels, which was confirmed. They must tread carefully.


[1/28/2025 11:43 PM] Cole Mercer
*Once unwrapped, Cole picked up his mask, __hesitating__ for a moment before ultimately securing it back onto his face. Without wasting another second, he turned around, rifle raised!*


[1/28/2025 11:44 PM] Ghost
**"Stay close. We're not alone."** *he murmured, moving forward with precise, measured steps.*


[1/28/2025 11:47 PM] Cat Bayes
*Her head jerked in the direction of the bang, hand gripping the hilt of her revolver tightly.* **"R-Right, understood."**

*Before they moved, she gave him a look.* **"I've got your back."**


[1/28/2025 11:49 PM] Ghost
*Ghost responded without hesitation,* **"Understood."**


[1/28/2025 11:53 PM] Cat Bayes
*With that, she raised her revolver forward and proceeded along the tunnel, at Cole's side.*


[1/28/2025 11:57 PM] Narration
Cat and Cole embarked on their journey along the winding canal, its murky waters reflecting the dim light of lights above. Having meticulously studied the maps, Cole felt confident that an exit path awaited them just a mile ahead. As they navigated through the damp tunnels, anticipation filled the air, but their optimism waned as they drew closer to the expected exit. The tunnels revealed a perplexing scene: many paths were misaligned with the maps, some completely absent, as if swallowed by the earth itself. The few remaining paths were choked with debris—fallen stones and rubble from ancient collapses—or had been intentionally sealed off, hinting at some dark, hidden purpose.


[1/29/2025 12:01 AM] Ghost
**“We can’t keep relying on the map, too many pathways leading to who knows where.”** *Ghost said, shifting the muzzle of his rifle as he scanned every corner and his surroundings.*


[1/29/2025 12:07 AM] Narration
The thunderous roar of rushing water drew closer as they continued their journey, echoing in their ears like a relentless torrent cascading down steep cliffs. The air became heavy with the cool mist rising from somewhere ahead, and the ground beneath their feet vibrated with the powerful energy of the flowing stream, surging with unyielding speed and force.

Soon, they came across a large space once more. The water beneath their feet running off the ledge and down into the bottomless pit. Even with Ghost's mask agumentations the bottom seemed non-existant. Across the way was another tunnel they could use... If they could make it across. The gap was 30 yards wide, making it impossible for them to jump across. It was their only way unless they felt lucky enough to plunge into the darkness below.


[1/29/2025 12:09 AM] Ghost
**”. . .”**


[1/30/2025 7:17 PM] Cat Bayes
*Wincing a little at the noise, Cat's gaze followed the relentless torrent of water down to the infinite death hole that led straight to the abyss. Not even her upgraded cyberdeck would be able to determine how long the drop to infinity would be, not that she wanted to find out.* **"Don't suppose you uh...have any secret jetpacks in that fancy armor of yours?"** *She nervously joked to Cole.*

*Following up on what was probably going to be either silence or an abrupt "No" from the mercenary, she activated her cyberdeck and began scanning the room for at least a __hint__ of a way forward.*


[1/30/2025 7:21 PM] Ghost
*Ghost slowly turned his head toward Cat, his red glowing eyes boring into her in silent disapproval, a reminder that this joke was not it chief... With that settled, he turned back around, training his rifle on the path they came from, ensuring nothing crept up on them.*


[1/30/2025 7:21 PM] Cat Bayes
*See? Expected as much.*


[1/30/2025 7:35 PM] Narration
A control panel was on the other side of the chasm against the wall. It's current state was "deactive". Perhaps activating it would prove to have some benefits?


[1/30/2025 7:41 PM] Cat Bayes
**"Mmmh, deactivated control panel at the opposite wall!"** *Cat called out, trying to raise her voice over the sound of the water!*

*Not wanting another lockdown situation with a swarm of Purafish, she decided to send a ping to the device to see what it was connected to.*


[1/30/2025 7:51 PM] Narration
The panel originated from a small console that was connected to a cable, which in turn linked to a platform large enough to accommodate two to three people at a time. Besides the power supply, nothing else in the facility was connected to this console or platform.


[1/30/2025 7:52 PM] Cat Bayes
*Cool! So Cat __definitely__ won't end up blowing them up by activating that control panel, good to know!*

*Satisfied with her scan, she send an activation command to the panel.* **"This should *hopefully* get us across."**


[1/30/2025 8:05 PM] Narration
There were virtually no security measures on the device. With a groan, the mechanisms that draw the platform out and extend protested as the man-made bridge stretched across the chasm and hit their side of the tunnel with a loud thud!

[1/30/2025 8:09 PM] Ghost
*As soon as the bridge emerged, Ghost turned to assess their new path across this shithole. He walked over to Cat, lingering in awkward silence for a brief moment before finally stating,* **"Your skills are useful. Stay close."** *Then, without another word, he moved forward.*


[1/30/2025 8:11 PM] Cat Bayes
**"Uhh..."** *Mmh, the two of them probably needed some more work in the communications department. But hey, she'll take the compliment!*

**"...Yeah, yours too."** *She awkwardly attempted to return the compliment, before following behind!*

[1/30/2025 8:25 PM] Narration
The canal they had been traversing extended endlessly into the distance, its concrete banks lined with broken slabs and debris. Above them, numerous pipe tunnels loomed, each suspended several meters overhead, their rusty exteriors glinting dully in the sparse light provided by their optics and the scarce light sources. Some of these tunnels had succumbed to time, their entrances caved in and cloaked in layers of crumbling earth and asphalt, while others were completely sealed off, remnants of a bygone infrastructure. 

As they ventured further along the canal, the sound of rushing water grew louder, and they noticed that the canal banks gradually widened, with the water deepening and swirling more powerfully to their left. The once shallow stream transformed into a substantial waterway, dark and mysterious, reflecting the flickering light like a mirror to the unknown depths below.

After an hour of steady walking, fatigue began to settle in as they made their way down the straight path. Each step felt more significant, echoing the rhythm of their journey.


[1/30/2025 8:30 PM] Ghost
*Walking was generally Ghost's main method of getting from point A to B, but even he had his limits before fatigue set in. After a moment, he came to a stop, moving to the nearest wall on his right and leaning his back against it, taking a brief rest.*


[1/30/2025 8:32 PM] Cat Bayes
*Cat seemed to be feeling the worst of it, the adrenaline from her earlier fight with Cole long since faded, and the fatigue had begun to remind her of the ringing pain in her ear. Noticing that even that battle hardened Cole was taking a moment to rest, she decided it wouldn't hurt to take a breather for a minute or two, mimicking his action on the wall adjacent from him.* **"You...said you had a map? How much...longer do we have to go?"**


[1/30/2025 8:36 PM] Ghost
**"Forget the map. It's outdated and useless, the place has changed."** *Ghost stated bluntly. Despite his exhaustion, there was no hint of fatigue in his voice. He had no intention of resting for long.*


[1/30/2025 8:47 PM] Cat Bayes
**"Ah, right...cause that would make things too easy."** *Cat chuckled dryly in response. She couldn't help but admit, even she felt a little admiration for how badass this dude was. They've been walking for god knows how long in this dank ass tunnel and he sounded like he wasn't even breaking a sweat.*

**"Mmh..."** *She rubbed at her right ear for a moment, feeling the flakes of dry blood that caked it. Everything was coming in muffled and distorted, and it was giving the girl a great deal of discomfort...*


[1/30/2025 8:51 PM] Ghost
*Ghost glanced at her, noting the toll it had taken on her. For a brief second, he almost raised his free hand—but hesitated. Something held him back. What was he about to do?*  

*Instead, he simply stated,* **"Could take hours... maybe days to recover."**  

*Uh... thanks, Cole?*


[1/30/2025 8:54 PM] Cat Bayes
**"Huh?"** *Cat looked up to him in confusion.* **"Did you say something?"**

*Yeesh, he really did a number on her, huh.*


[1/30/2025 8:55 PM] Ghost
**"No."**


[1/30/2025 9:08 PM] Cat Bayes
**"Mmh..."** *If you say so! Cat went back to rubbing at the ear for a minute before lowering her hand.* **"So...did Freddie say what he wanted to do to Horizon Grey?"**


[1/30/2025 9:14 PM] Ghost
*Ghost's eyes stayed locked on the ground, his body motionless. After a brief silence, he finally responded.* **"No. He asked for information,"** *he said flatly.* **"I don't believe he's here to talk."**


[1/30/2025 9:16 PM] Cat Bayes
**"So, probably hostile..."** *Cat looked down at the dimly lit asphalt, lost in thought. After a few seconds, she looked back up to him.* **"How...should we tell the others?"**


[1/30/2025 9:19 PM] Ghost
*Ghost immediately shot back,* **"That's for you to figure out. I have __no intention__ of telling them anything."** *His tone was sharp.*


[1/30/2025 9:25 PM] Cat Bayes
**"Huh? Why not?"** *She pushed off the wall a bit and folded her arms, her eyebrows pitching.* **"Wouldn't it be better to tell them the truth? We both know how keeping secrets got us into this situation."**


[1/30/2025 9:36 PM] Ghost
*Ghost let out a low grunt,* **"What I did was unforgivable,"** *With a forceful push, he detached himself from the wall, standing at his full height, towering. His rifle hung loosely in his grip.*

**"I couldn't care less if the truth gets out,"** *he continued, his eyes narrowing into steely slits behind the mask.* **"If they see me as a threat, I’ll retaliate without hesitation. When that happens, stay out of everyone’s way and __protect yourself.__"**


[1/30/2025 10:00 PM] Cat Bayes
**"..."** *The netrunner went quiet after he said that, her grip on her arms tightening as she cast her gaze downwards. She wasn't expecting him to hold her safety in such high regard, but...*

**"I can understand why you feel that way, but what happened is just as much as my fault as it is anyone else's."** *She said solemnly, before turning to face the path.* **"If anyone is to blame for why you did what you did, it's me. So if we *are* going to tell them, then we tell them the whole story."**


[1/31/2025 12:40 PM] Ghost
*Ghost pressed forward without hesitation, wasting no time. He remained silent for a while before finally speaking, his tone flat and firm, like someone who had learned this lesson the hard way.*

**“Your safety comes first. If you can avoid a bad situation, do it. Don’t put yourself in the line of fire when you don’t have to.”**

[1/31/2025 7:24 PM] Narration
Ghost and Cat continued through the ever-expanding canal for another 30 minutes until something ahead would catch their attention...

A flickering sign hung overhead, struggling to illuminate the words 'Transit Train' in a dull, erratic glow. Beneath the sign, a massive window was embedded in the wall, its glass smudged and grimy, obscuring the view beyond. Through the murky pane, a dormant underground train loomed just beyond the pane, its once-vibrant exterior now cloaked in darkness, hinting that it had sat unused for an indeterminate time. The heavy doors that separated the canal side from the train stood resolutely sealed, their metal surfaces cold and unyielding.

To the right of the doorway, a terminal screen flickered feebly, its once-bright display now a shattered mosaic of dead pixels, casting a ghostly glow on the surrounding debris.


[1/31/2025 7:30 PM] Ghost
*Ghost's gaze remained locked on the train, his eyes narrowing beneath the mask. He spoke, his tone measured and direct.* 

**"This might be our way out. See if you can get it running, I’ll secure the area."**


[2/13/2025 8:01 PM] Cat Bayes
*The trek had been pretty much dead silent between the two as they continued down the deprecated tunnel system, the slight chill from the humidity in the air often sending a miniscule shiver down the netrunner's spine. Coming across the struggling neon sign and reading it's flickering text, Cat made her way closer to the smog-covered window and wiped as much of the glass as she could with her sleeve, revealing the massive...vehicle? Just barely visible in dim lighting.*

**"Holy shit, how long has this been here?"** *She gasped quietly, before turning to Ghostgaze.* **"U-Uh...Yeah, I'll see what I can do..."** 

*Disregarding the fact that this technology seemed ancient as hell, and that she didn't recognize the vehicle at all, this was gonna be tough. Welp, time to see what her trusty cyberdeck tells her!*


[2/13/2025 9:15 PM] Ghost
*Acknowledging Cat’s words, Ghost moved forward to fulfill his part. Activating his night vision, he kept his rifle at the ready, scanning the area and ensuring their safety…*

[2/14/2025 2:02 PM] Narration
The cyberdeck provided the bare minimum in terms of interface capabilities. The only way the Blue-haired net runner could scrape the data was through the board within the terminal, which had wireless connectivity capabilities. The terminal only had three commands that were understandable. The remaining two were gibberish.

1. Open/Close
2. Forward
3. Backward
4. ???
5. ???


[2/15/2025 8:08 PM] Cat Bayes
*Well, disregarding the last two options, the first two seemed to hold the most promise. Her eyes flashed as she sent the command to “Open” to the terminal.*


[2/16/2025 12:27 PM] Narration
A rapid series of beeps sounded from the terminal, signaling that the command had been received. The doors separating them from the train began to open, but a very unpleasant screeching noise erupted from the door's actuators. This caused the door to jam, resulting in only a partial opening to the train. The gap was wide enough for Cat to squeeze through, but Cole might struggle to fit without getting stuck.

The train's interior was illuminated, and its contents remained intact thanks to the airlock doors. Every light was functioning, none dull or missing. Overall, the visible seats were in decent condition, and the flooring appeared immaculate.

Then, a chime echoed through the car and into the tunnel where Cat and Cole were.

**"Welcome to the Thamesford's Water Treatment transit line... Terminal B... Please, find a seat and the controller will send the car for Terminal A shortly, thank you."**


[2/16/2025 12:54 PM] Cat Bayes
*Cat’s initial excitement was quashed by the cringing, screeching sound of rusted metal. Looking over, she saw that the door had only partially opened - still enough for her to fit through, but for Cole…ehhh.* **”I don’t suppose you have any oil on you for occasions like this, eh?”** *She dryly joked to the mercenary behind her, knowing her efforts to get him to laugh were futile.*

I KNEW IT-


[2/16/2025 1:02 PM] Ghost
*He barely reacted. His stare remained blank, his rifle lowered at his side. The only thing visible in the dim light were his unmoving, unshifting red eyes. Yeah... maybe next time, Cat.*


[2/16/2025 1:13 PM] Cat Bayes
*Sigh, can’t win them all…shaking her head in defeat, she moved over to the door and inspected the gap.* **”Think you can fit through? Looks like a pretty tight squeeze.”**


[2/16/2025 1:16 PM] Ghost
*Ghost slung his rifle over his back and stepped toward the door, giving Cat a light push to move her aside. His eyes quickly scanned it before he wedged his fingers between the panels and began forcing them apart. He was strong, but the real question was, were the doors stronger?*


[2/16/2025 1:19 PM] Narration
As Ghost pulled on the doors and as he did so, the sound of an actuator slowly turning could be heard. The doors were heavy, but they eventually began to open enough for the two of them to enter without any significant problems.


[2/16/2025 1:23 PM] Ghost
**"Get in."**


[2/16/2025 1:51 PM] Cat Bayes
**"Huh, touche."** *It's a real good thing Cole decided against punching her when they had that confrontation earlier. Moving past Cole, she climbed aboard the ancient derelict and rummaged around. Sheesh, this thing was old as hell!*


[2/16/2025 1:52 PM] Ghost
*He followed, obviously.*


[2/16/2025 2:01 PM] Narration
Onboard the train car, there was a physical screen mounted to the far side of the vehicle. It was showing **'Thamesford'** advertisements. The first advertisement was for a neighborhood improvement initiative, showing a neighborhood that looked NOTHING like what they had seen before. Large quantities of buildings were made of bricks and cobblestone. These large plants were frequently more significant than some of the buildings. The cars looked...foreign but brand new for their time and the enviroment had virtually no neon.

The second advertisement on the physical screen showed a bustling marketplace, filled with vendors selling fresh produce, handmade crafts, and other wares. The market was nestled in the heart of Thamesford, surrounded by buildings made of all sorts of materials. 

As the ad continued, it showed off the unique charm of Thamesford, highlighting its quaint cafes, cozy bookstores, and bustling boutiques that seemed to be tucked away on every corner. The ad also featured a stunning park in the center of town, where people of all ages were playing frisbee, picnicking, or simply lounging in the sun. The advertisement ended with a call-to-action, inviting visitors to experience Thamesford for themselves and discover its hidden gems firsthand.


[2/16/2025 3:46 PM] Cat Bayes
**"Thamesford..."** *The name lingered in her words for a few moments as she tried to recall the name of that location, with nothing notable coming to mind. She was tempted to ask Cole his thoughts, but knowing she'd probably get scolded for not focusing as a response, she decided to see what the train could tell them.*

**"Does uh...that map of yours tell you anything about Terminal A?"** *Just a casual question, no harm in that, right?*


[2/16/2025 3:54 PM] Ghost
**"No. Just as clueless as you are."** *he stated flatly.*

*Ghost took a brief glance around before settling on a nearby seat. He sat down, letting Cat work her magic, this wasn't his area of expertise. If anything, they were only inside the train thanks to her.*


[2/16/2025 4:49 PM] Cat Bayes
*Well, with that helpful information now obtained, she gave him a shrug and accessed the terminal once more. With a flash of her cybernetic eyes, she sent the command for `Forward` *


[2/16/2025 4:52 PM] Narration
That chime from earlier played and the the car lurched forward roughly once before smoothing out as it began navigating down the unknown.

**"Heading for... Thamesford's Water Treatment Terminal A... Estimate time of arrival...  40 minutes."**


[2/16/2025 4:58 PM] Cat Bayes
**"Guh!"** *She quickly held onto something as the car unexpectedly shook before slowly picking up momentum along the track. Once she got her bearings again, she sat next to Cole and looked up towards the PA system.*

**"Forty minutes, huh...? Think it'll put us closer to the HQ?"**


[2/16/2025 5:02 PM] Ghost
*Ghost remained seated, showing no intention of moving anytime soon. When the train started rolling, he wasn’t surprised by the momentum. Even as Cat sat next to him, he barely reacted, maintaining his silence before finally responding to her question.*

**“If it doesn’t, we prepare for the worst.”**


[2/16/2025 5:05 PM] Cat Bayes
**"I uh...see."** *Well, no use worrying about it now. For the time being, she rested her head against the seat as her thoughts wandered elsewhere.* **"Say, what was Freddie like?"**


[2/16/2025 5:16 PM] Ghost
*Ghost didn’t react right away. He let the question sit, mulling it over in silence. His head remained still, his gaze fixed forward, as if weighing his words carefully. After a long pause, he finally spoke.*

**“Don’t know him well enough for a full assessment.”** *His tone was cold, detached.* **“But he strikes me as an old man chasing one last mission. He mentioned a daughter, that means he has a __weakness.__”**


[2/16/2025 5:24 PM] Cat Bayes
**"A daughter, huh...?"** *She muttered, processing the information.* **"I could try to look into her some more, maybe use her as a bargaining chip to get him off our backs?"**


[2/16/2025 5:32 PM] Ghost
**“Good thinking, but there’s a reason I was planning to leave this district.”** *His tone was firm and direct, with no room for doubt.*

*He turned his head slowly, his red eyes locking onto Cat’s with an unyielding gaze. He wasn’t here to soften the blow.*

**“District 9 and the CCR are finished. They’re being dismantled. According to that old man, things are only going to get worse, especially in Fairview.”** *He paused for a moment, then continued, his voice even colder.*

**“Haven Heights will be carpet-bombed. What happened to Paige and Mathias? That’s just the __beginning.__”**


[2/16/2025 5:42 PM] Cat Bayes
**"...What?"** *It took a second or two for her to take in his words. Carpet-bombed, the entire thing? Were the CCR even allowed to do that?!*

*No, this wasn't the CCR, was it? According to Cole, they're being dismantled, so how high up was this crazy ass decision? The Corpos...no, even higher than them.* **"We...We have to warn the others, right? This is fucking insane..."**


[2/16/2025 5:49 PM] Ghost
**“__The Vesperian Legion.__ That’s what the old man said.”** *His voice was sharp, devoid of any emotion as he processed the gravity of the situation.*

*He let out a heavy sigh, leaning back against the headrest, his eyes narrowing beneath the mask.* **“What if we don’t reach them in the next 40 minutes?”** *he asked coldly.* **“Have you really thought about where we stand right now? The odds aren’t in our favor. We’re running out of time.”**


[2/27/2025 10:13 PM] Cat Bayes
**"Jesus fucking Christ..."** *Cat muttered under her breath, leaning forward to rest her elbows on her knees while she loosely gripped the sides of her head, foot rapidly tapping against the metal floor of the rumbling train.* **"Are they- Can they even *do* that? No, of course they can - they *would* do that - it's the god damned corpos we're talking about here. Fuck, do they even know how many people live here?!"**

*Taking a moment to catch her breath, she looked over towards Cole as reminded her of their situation.* **"So...what are you suggesting here, we do *nothing* to warn the others back at HQ? How soon before Freddie reaches them, or the bombings take place?"**


[2/27/2025 10:17 PM] Ghost
*Ghost let the silence linger before responding, his voice cold and measured.*

# **"__Survival comes first.__ We don’t know where this train leads, and until we do, everything else is secondary. Before considering others, focus on what’s in front of us. If we don’t make it, __nothing else matters.__"**


[2/27/2025 10:24 PM] Cat Bayes
*She stared at him, considering his words under the tense silence accompanied by the heavy yet muffled roar of train wheels grinding against metal track. After a while, she turned back to face the wall adjacent to them, watching her reflection in the smoggy window.* **"I get where you're coming from, I do...Shit, I'm a Heights kid, that logic might as well be a part of my neural port with how drilled in it is."**

*She paused, taking a moment to chuckle dryly before exhaling.* **"But Paige, and Mathias for that matter...they're family to me, man. They saved my life, taught me how to *live,* and whole bunch of other shit besides."** *Saying that, she turned back towards Cole with a stern glare, eyes brimming with determination.* **"I'm sure as shit not about to abandon them now."**


[2/27/2025 10:29 PM] Ghost
*Ghost didn’t react immediately. He remained still, staring straight ahead as the train rumbled beneath them. When he finally spoke, his tone was just as cold as before.* **"Then make sure you __live__ long enough to help them. Sentiment doesn’t mean much if you’re __dead.__"** *His red eyes flicked toward her briefly before returning to the darkened landscape outside.* **"Loyalty’s a virtue, but it __doesn’t override__ survival. If you want to save them, then don’t get yourself killed trying."**


[2/27/2025 10:31 PM] Cat Bayes
**"Pffft, I don't plan on it!"** *Cat gave the somber man a cheeky grin and flexed, patting her...well, it wasn't that impressive of a bicep, even hidden under her baggy jacket sleeve.* **"Nine lives, remember? Well, eight now, but I'll worry about that later."**


[2/27/2025 10:33 PM] Ghost
*Ghost exhaled sharply, not quite a sigh, but close.*


[2/27/2025 10:36 PM] Cat Bayes
**"I'll take that as a chuckle."** *Cat smirked, before laying her head back on the headrest. Despite her gleaming positivity, inside she was...well, she was shitting bricks. Cole would probably be able to tell just from how fast her heel was tapping against the metal floor of the train. It was a rapid, rhythmic metronome that was just barely drowned out by the roar of the train outside.*


[2/27/2025 10:40 PM] Ghost
*Ghost didn’t acknowledge her remark, if she wanted to pretend, he wasn’t going to stop her. But his eyes flicked down, catching the rapid movement of her foot against the floor.*
-# *Nervous.*
*He didn’t call her out on it, but he didn’t ignore it either. Instead, he stated, cold and matter of fact,* **"Stay sharp. Don’t let fear make decisions for you."**

*His gaze shifted back to the window, watching the darkness rush past.* **"I do what I do best. You do what you do best."** *he stated, his tone flat and detached. In his own way, it was as close as Cole would come to saying, 'Don't worry about it.'*


[2/27/2025 10:46 PM] Cat Bayes
**"..."** *She wasn't quite used to him and this new...'positive' outlook he's trying to put on, but for what it's worth, it did help Cat calm her nerves just a bit. Gradually, her foot began to slow it's tapping until it stopped with a deep breath from the young netrunner. Her shoulders drooped as the tension left her body, and she cracked a more genuine smile now.* **"...Yeah, thanks."** *Was all she said, before she closed her eyes. This was probably going to be the last bit of rest she'd have for a long time.*


[2/27/2025 10:47 PM] Ghost
*Ghost let out a low, indifferent grunt.*


[2/27/2025 10:50 PM] Narration
The train ride was, for all tense and purposes a fairly smooth ride for the duo. Approximately 40 minutes as announced passed and the train car was beginning its deacceleration after the long and anxious filled ride. 

## Ding dong! ##
"**Now arriving at: Water Treatment Terminal A... Thank you for your continious work, making Thamesford's a better place to be... If you would please remain seated until the car comes to a complete stop and the doors open, you can prevent the twice as likely chance of an acccident from occuring to you or those around you."** The pre-recorded announcement droned on...


[2/27/2025 10:51 PM] Ghost
*Ghost immediately stood up, wasting no time. He readied his rifle and stood alert, waiting for the doors to open.*


[2/27/2025 10:55 PM] Cat Bayes
*Cat was jerked awake by the sound of the PA's voice crackling to life, before snapping her head towards Cole. She blinked a few times, before finding the brainpower to open her mouth.* **"We're here? How long has it been?"**


[2/27/2025 10:56 PM] Ghost
**"Forty minutes."** *he stated, his eyes locked on the doors.*


[2/27/2025 10:58 PM] Cat Bayes
**"So there still might be time..."** *She breathed a sigh of relief, before finding the nearest rail to hold on to as the train came to a grinding halt.* **"We'll have to see if there's a map or something when we get out, see if we can't figure out where we're at."**


[2/27/2025 11:00 PM] Narration
The whiriling noise that was the train ambient sound going down the track came to a crawl before finally coming to a stop...

...

The doors never opened.


[2/27/2025 11:00 PM] Ghost
# ". . ."


[2/27/2025 11:01 PM] Cat Bayes
**"...?"** *Uh, was that supposed to happen?* **"Mmhh..."** *Her cyberdeck blinked to life.*


[2/27/2025 11:06 PM] Narration
Similarly to what was presented to the netrunner 40 minutes prior. She was presented with five commands, two of which were not English.


[2/27/2025 11:07 PM] Cat Bayes
**"Oh, stupid fucking manual..."** *She cursed to herself before sending the command for the door to open once more.*


[2/27/2025 11:10 PM] Narration
This time around, the doors opened seamlessly. Opening up into what looked to be an underground train station? It was ungodly dark here unlike what they were accustomed to with the ambient red lights back where they once were...


[2/27/2025 11:13 PM] Ghost
*Luckily, Ghost’s new mask allowed him to see clearly in the darkness, an invaluable feature. He approached the train door frames, placing his left hand on the cold steel to steady himself. His right hand gripped his rifle. He scanned the area ahead, taking in every detail, his mind analysing the surroundings... __what did he notice?__*


[2/27/2025 11:17 PM] Narration
Cat and Cole would emerge out on to a platform, to the left (in general direction in which they came from was a staircase that seemed to go up and up for ages. To the right is where the platform ends and nestled against the edge of the platform were underground trains, similar to one they came off of, but bigger. Abandoned with time, the air here was heavy and unforgiving as if it had not moved or stirred for decades. The furtherst two trains down the platform ahead of them had a sign that read, **London**, and **Brimingham** and **Manchester** were on above the remaining two trains.

Also before them seemed to be abandoned shops and a seating area that was left to disrepair. However, oddly preserved.


[2/27/2025 11:21 PM] Cat Bayes
**"Ugh, so dark in here...hope that mask comes with night vision?"** *Cat was having a little more trouble seeing in dark than Cole was, her cyberdeck only granting her a few inches worth of sight in the pervasive darkness. At least she could see any potential electrical components or techy bits that stood out.*


[2/27/2025 11:25 PM] Narration
Electrical long stopped operating in this place aside from the sign that read **London**. But even that was barely powering on. It would flicker on for a second and plunge the train underneath it into darkness for uncoherent amounts of time... Power led to a generator somewhere beyond a restricted access door on the other side of the platform.


[2/27/2025 11:25 PM] Ghost
*Ghost immediately took note of the stairs to the left. If they were underground, then those steps might be their way out. His gaze then shifted to the signs, __unfamiliar__ names, ones he had never heard before. Strange.*

*Without hesitation, he moved toward the staircase, his rifle at the ready, scanning the area with calculated vigilance.*


[2/27/2025 11:28 PM] Narration
The stairs were made of some kind of rock... From his night vision, he could tell there was a hint of gloss from the surface. The railings were primarily comprised of glass. Some of which has been cracked in places. The flight of stairs would go up 15 steps before you would come upon a landing. From there, you'd turn to your right and go up another flight. This would repeat for a while it seems as even Ghost's enhancements wouldn't allow him to see that far out.


[2/27/2025 11:29 PM] Ghost
*He turned around and checked if Cat was following?*


[2/27/2025 11:31 PM] Cat Bayes
*Cat really had no other option, although that London sign did pique her interest...No, focus Cat. There wasn't any time to be looking into the secrets of the universe right now.*

*She was hot on Cole's trail, since that was all she could really see with the electronic components in his suit.*


[2/27/2025 11:33 PM] Ghost
*With that cleared, Cole pressed on. He ascended the stairs, then veered right to continue.*


[2/27/2025 11:34 PM] Cat Bayes
*She continued to follow the electronic signals coming from Ghost, keeping a look out for anything of interest along the way.*


[2/27/2025 11:38 PM] Narration
The pair made it to the 'second floor' of the train station. Here, were walkways that should have provided a overview of the platform below. There were maps that did could have made sense... They were greeted with this massive map of what appears to be a large expanse of area. A marker symbol with the phrase "You're here." indiciated that they were in what is known as Thamesford. There were a ton of names that were forgein to them but further West on the map in bold showed **LONDON**. An huge expansive of networks stretched between them and London and other neighboring locations.

If they were to veer right or left, they would continue ascending up the steps...


[2/27/2025 11:41 PM] Ghost
**“You might want to put your reunion on hold.”** *he stated coldly, his eyes narrowing. He had a feeling they were far from home.*

*Without another word, he pressed on.*


[2/27/2025 11:43 PM] Cat Bayes
**"We can't have gone...that far, could we?"** *Whatever the case, it seemed they weren't in Kansas anymore...whatever that saying meant.*

*Taking another look at the map just to make sure, she went back to following Cole.*


[2/27/2025 11:49 PM] Narration
As the two continued to ascend, the sound of the outside world, muffled as it may be, started to become profound. However, there stood one problem. Once they got to the third landing, it stretched on to a dead-end at first glance. No where else to go... Hmm.


[2/27/2025 11:50 PM] Ghost
**”. . .?”**


[2/27/2025 11:51 PM] Cat Bayes
*Cat noticed Cole stopping in his tracks, unable to see the dead-end ahead of them.* **"What's up?"**


[2/27/2025 11:53 PM] Ghost
**“Stay alert. Something’s off,”** *he stated.*

*Cole pressed forward, intent on reaching the end of the path first to assess the situation up close.*


[2/27/2025 11:55 PM] Narration
Ghost got up to the wall. There was a seam, around the same size as a door would be... Was the door sealed shut?


[2/27/2025 11:56 PM] Narration
One could get their fingers within the gap, but pulling it certainly would be a challenge judging by sturdiness of the steel that made up the panel in the wall.


[2/27/2025 11:57 PM] dysplexus
isn't this like


[2/27/2025 11:57 PM] dysplexus
the fourth time?


[2/27/2025 11:58 PM] dysplexus
LOL


[2/27/2025 11:59 PM] Ghost
*Ghost ran his gloved fingers along the seam, feeling the narrow gap. Without hesitation, he set his rifle down against the wall and wedged his fingers into the opening. He braced himself, muscles tensing beneath his cloak, and began **pulling**, testing the strength of the steel with a steady, deliberate effort.*


[2/28/2025 12:00 AM] Cat Bayes
*Meanwhile, Cat began looking for any electrical signals that might be keeping the door shut. Maybe that generator from earlier...?*


[2/28/2025 12:10 AM] Narration
The door was not powered, unfortunately. Making it a test of might and perhaps patience... The door panel was not budging, at least not at first until the corner popped lose, presenting sunlight in the dark void in which they resided in. It was blinding to say the least, going on hours without sufficient light.


[2/28/2025 12:12 AM] Cat Bayes
**"Agh, fuck!"** *Cat silently cursed under her breath as the ray of light beamed her eyes, her hand instinctively moving up to block her face as she tried to adjust her eyes.*


[2/28/2025 12:13 AM] Ghost
*He kept pulling, his grip tightening. Fortunately, his mask shielded his eyes from the harsh glare of any sudden light.*


[3/1/2025 6:21 PM] Narration
Ghost pulled upon the frame, peeling back the warping metal bit by bit until the rest gave way, leaving Ghost with a 8 foot panel in his arms. Light bled into the space they occupied and as their eyes adjusted, they could see asphalt on the ground immediately in front of them and building on the other side of the asphalt path. The building was made of steel? They would need to exit the building in order to get a better idea of what was around them.


[3/1/2025 6:57 PM] Ghost
*Ghost held the heavy panel for a moment before tossing it aside with a dull thud. His eyes adjusted quickly to the light as he surveyed the area ahead, an asphalt path leading toward a steel constructed building? They needed a better vantage point. Without hesitation, Ghost stepped forward, rifle at the ready.* **"Let's move,"** *he ordered.*


[3/1/2025 9:59 PM] Narration
Ghost emerged into a labyrinth of towering industrial like structures. A fog permeated the area, preventing the clarity that one would expect. The air is less dense than the train station they found themselves in, but the scent of damp metal filled their nostrils. The alloy walls were slick with moisture from the drizzile that swept across the area.

Amber lights pierced through the fog, adorning the edges of the monolithic buildings. Overhead, skeletal bridges and walkways crisscrossed. Leading to different buildings. The echoes of distant machinery and the sound of tires rolling of roads dominated the overall ambient. The pavement beneath him were slick and dark, every few meters or so, a metal panel replaced sections of the asphalt.

There was no movement—no signs of life, save for the occassional passing pair of headlight that bled into the alleyway and continued on its way. This place was foreign... This alley alone was too clean to be Haven Heights and too oppressive to be Fairview...

[3/2/2025 7:23 AM] Ghost
*‘Where the hell are we?’ that would have been Cole’s first thought if he were more of an average man and less of what he really is. But he didn’t dwell on questions without answers. Instead, he stayed sharp, scanning his surroundings with the same cold precision as always. He was the one with the rifle. It was his job to ensure they made it out of here in one piece.

As they moved, he silently took in the scene, the thick fog clinging to the ground, the industrial sprawl stretching endlessly around them, the dull amber glow of overhead lights barely cutting through the haze. **This place was wrong.** Isolated. Forgotten. The further they walked, the more certain he became. __They weren’t just far from HQ. They were off the map entirely.__ His footsteps echoed unnaturally, swallowed by the vast emptiness around them. Were they alone? If so, why the hell was a facility of this scale abandoned?

Then, without thinking, he glanced to the side, **checking** on Cat. That was odd. A day ago, he wouldn’t have given her a second thought. Now, he was taking note of her, making sure she was still there.*

***Unusual.***


[3/3/2025 1:20 PM] Cat Bayes
*Cat was - whether it was to Cole's relief or not - still there for the time being! Her attention seemed to be focused elsewhere, her eyes illuminated with that distinct orange glow that indicated a call or a message. Seems she was trying to reach somebody.*

*And reach somebody she was; Kode, to be exact. Now that they were aboveground, Cat felt it was high time that she try to get in contact with somebody back at HQ. With Paige and Mathias most likely still out of commission, the ripperdoc was her only reliable source of contact.*

*The line still ringing in her brain, she glanced over towards her companion and noticed him checking on her, giving him a slight wave in response.*


[3/3/2025 2:02 PM] Ghost
*Ghost barely acknowledged the gesture, his focus already shifting back to their surroundings. If she wanted to waste time trying to reach someone, that was on her. He had his doubts about whether the signal would even go through in a place like this, but he wasn’t about to tell her how to handle her own nerves. If it kept her occupied and out of his way, so be it.*

*Still, something about this place gnawed at him. The more he looked, the less sense it made. Empty streets, abandoned buildings, yet everything was intact, no signs of decay, no overgrowth, no scavengers picking through the remnants. It was as if the place had been frozen in time, waiting for something. Ghost tightened his grip on his rifle, his voice cutting through the stagnant air.*

**“Stay sharp. If this place was abandoned,__ it’d look like it.__”**


[3/3/2025 2:10 PM] Cat Bayes
*Cat turned to face him properly before giving him an assured nod. Now that he mentioned it, something was pretty off about this place. The mystery of the London signs besides, they had __zero__ clue where they were, and Cat's never heard of a place that looked so...clean? Yet seemingly devoid of any life as well.*

*It was starting to make her skin crawl.*

**"I'll...keep my eyes peeled for trouble."** *She said, the butterflies evident in her tone.* **"I'm hoping to get in touch with Kode, see if I can't warn him to start evacuating...might save us the trouble of rushing through unknown territory."**

`"Kode."` He announced himself through Cat's noggin. Great, he picked up.


[3/3/2025 5:16 PM] Cat Bayes
`"Kode! Thank fucking God!"` *Cat let out an exasperated gasp of relief as she shot Cole a thumbs up.* `"Are Paige and Mathias there? Are you guys okay?"`


[3/3/2025 5:39 PM] Kode
`"Define, Okay."` There was a brief pause. `"Yeah, everything is mostly Okay... Received some visitors, I assume you knew something about them?"`


[3/3/2025 5:41 PM] Cat Bayes
`"...What kind of visitors?"` *There was a sinking feeling welling in Cat's chest. She was hoping to god it wasn't who she thought it was, but most likely...it probably was.*


[3/3/2025 5:53 PM] Kode
`"The kind I tried warning my beloved Paige about. Know something about that?"` He asked, almost accusatory.


[3/3/2025 5:57 PM] Cat Bayes
`"If it's the kind related to Freddie Dawson, then..."` *She looked over towards Cole for a moment before shaking her head, breathing out a sigh.* `"Look, there's no time to explain anything right now, the CCR's getting disbanded and now everything's going apeshit."`

`"What happened to Paige and Mathias at the old HQ? That's about to happen to all of Haven Heights, maybe even Fairview. Details are kinda scarce right now, but you need to focus on getting everyone out of there as soon as possible."`


[3/3/2025 6:06 PM] Kode
`"... Where are you?"` It seems as if Kode has a different approach to what Cat was informing him of.


[3/3/2025 6:08 PM] Cat Bayes
`"I...well, I don't know at the moment."` *Cat scratched her head as she took another look at the hauntingly sterile environment they'd found themselves in.* `"Had a bit of an accident in the sewers with Cole, tripped some kind of security system and got trapped...we had to walk for a while before we came across a transit station. We rode the train for about...forty-ish minutes?`


[3/3/2025 6:10 PM] Cat Bayes
`"It looks like we're in some kind of "abandoned" ghost city, empty streets and quiet air...but it's too well maintained, everything looks way too clean...We kept seeing signs in the transit station pointing to places like London and uh...Birmingham?"`


[3/3/2025 6:13 PM] Kode
`"Fuck. Sounds like you're in Monita. It'll be hell to get you out. No, it's not possible to get you out."`


[3/3/2025 6:19 PM] Kode
`"Listen carefully if you want to live. Lay lower than you ever have in your life. Avoid authorities, and keep your identity hidden. You're on your own for the foreseeable future—until we can find you an out. As it stands right now, we don't get the bodies to stage a rescue mission."`

`"With our new friend, we can get Mathias' extremities back in working order.."` He left out Paige. `"Damn it."`


[3/3/2025 6:26 PM] Ghost
*He turned around once more, stopping in his tracks. What was she holding up for? And what was with that look on her face? A few questions ran through his mind, but no answers yet. Without a word, he stepped over to the nearest wall and leaned his back against it, lowering his rifle. His gaze remained locked on Cat, his red eyes glowing.*


[3/3/2025 6:42 PM] Cat Bayes
*Well, that throws a wrench in the works. Fucking Monita? Cat didn't know much about this place, but the name did come up a few times back when she was a freelance netrunner. They might as well have thrown themselves right into the hornet's nest of Corpo goonery.*

*Taking the moment to collect her thoughts, she raised an eyebrow at the last thing he said.* `"And...Paige too, right? She's okay?"`


[3/3/2025 6:49 PM] Kode
`"Not improving, but not declining. The meds I managed to procure are dated and aren't as effective. Working on resolving that. Just focus on what is ahead of you for now."`


[3/3/2025 6:58 PM] Cat Bayes
`"...Alright, just promise me you guys'll start high tailing it out of the district."` *The concern was visible on her face, but right now...there really was nothing she could do about this situation.* `"We'll update you once we found a good spot to lay low."`


[3/3/2025 7:00 PM] Kode
`"Sounds like a plan."`


[3/3/2025 7:06 PM] Cat Bayes
`"Catch you on the reg."` *With that, Cat's eyes dimmed back to their natural blue as she turned to Cole...the worrisome expression on her face alone was probably enough to tell him that she did not have good news.*

**"We've gotta move, find some place to lay low and __stay there__."** *She explained briefly, before raising her hood over her head.* **"Somehow, we ended up in fucking Monita."**


[3/3/2025 7:15 PM] Ghost
**“Then we don’t waste time. Stay close, keep your head down.”** *His voice was low, firm. There was no room for argument. He took the lead, scanning the area as he moved. If they were in Monita, then laying low wasn’t just a precaution, it was a __necessity.__*


[3/3/2025 7:16 PM] Cat Bayes
**"Yeah."** *Cat nodded as she adjusted her hood just a bit lower. Neither of them had any idea what to expect once they got out onto the streets, were there even civilians walking around here? How out of place would they look just __being__ there?*

[3/4/2025 10:26 PM] Narration
By the time Cat and Cole returned to the hideout, it was late in the evening. On the outside, everything look like it always has. No signs of forced entry, no struggle, or damage. They were now approaching the door that neighbored the vehicle bay doors to the factory...


[3/4/2025 10:29 PM] Cole Mercer
*Cole was the first to enter __without__ hesitation. Just like any other day, his entry was sudden and at an optimal pace. What did he see?*


[3/4/2025 10:30 PM] Cat Bayes
*To say that it'd been a long day for the two was quite the understatement. While Cat was ready for all this shit to be over, it'd be a little while longer before she could enjoy the soft comfort of her bed once more.*

*She watched Cole enter, and waited for a second before following in behind him.*


[3/4/2025 10:34 PM] Narration
Kode pulled up a chair behind one of the Ion Enforcers. Seated in it, he was watching the doors for them to arrive. His legs and arms were crossed.


[3/4/2025 10:34 PM] Kode
The illumination in his eyes dulled the moment Cole broke through the threshold, followed by Cat. **"Made it back in one piece, that is good."**


[3/4/2025 10:37 PM] Cat Bayes
**"Yaaaaay..."** *Cat cheered sarcastically. That being said, she __did__ seem relieved to be home. Scoffing a bit, she gave Kode a slight smirk.* **"You guys okay?"**


[3/4/2025 10:38 PM] Cole Mercer
*Cole leaned against the wall, arms crossed once more. His eyes were closed, and his head hung low, facing the ground beneath them. He didn’t plan on saying much.*


[3/4/2025 10:40 PM] Kode
**"As okay as we will get for now. We have new residents. Catching Fred up to speed wasn't hard, with his daughter's needs in account, I have to be more attentive since I technically got more people to worry about."** He uncrossed his legs and arms, leaning forward with one arm pressed against his knee.


[3/4/2025 10:45 PM] Cat Bayes
**"So it *was* Freddie who showed up."** *She confirmed with a sigh of relief. She wasn't sure what to expect from the old man with everything she's heard, but if he's actually an ally, then that rectifies the situation...well, part of it. There's still the 'Cole' issue, but she wasn't ready to open that can of worms just yet.*


[3/4/2025 10:46 PM] Kode
**"Yes."**


[3/4/2025 10:58 PM] Cat Bayes
*Cat rubbed at her arm for a moment before speaking up once more.* **"Look, I know the timing for all of this shit happening is...really fucking bad...but I promise I can explain everything, once we've settled down..."**


[3/4/2025 11:00 PM] Cole Mercer
*With that, Cole unfolded his arms and started moving. His steps were slow and firm as he headed for his room, his hands tucked into the pockets of his trench coat...*


[3/4/2025 11:04 PM] Kode
Kode's eyes tracked Cole's for a while before settling back on Cat. **"I'm afraid the time for settling down has long passed."** He sounded almost sad.

[3/4/2025 11:08 PM] Cat Bayes
**"...Yeah, I know."** *She solemnly replied. Things were only going to get more hectic from here. Desperate to change the subject, she gave him a concerned look.* **"You said that Paige was still in a bad shape when we last spoke...has her condition improved at all?"**


[3/4/2025 11:11 PM] Kode
**"She is dependent on the heaviest pain medication I have. If there was any improvement, I am not seeing it."** He stood up, grabbing the chair and setting off to the side before walking towards the quarters. **"Come."**


[3/4/2025 11:19 PM] Cat Bayes
*She had to gulp to keep her mouth from going dry. She remembers what happened last time she entered that room, that pit in her stomach and the fearful emotions that swam through her mind. It was almost enough to make her pass out from seeing her sister in that state.*

*But she had to do this, for Paige, and for Mathias too. She was a member of Horizon Grey, time to act like it.*

*Steeling herself, she followed behind Kode.*


[3/4/2025 11:24 PM] Kode
Kode led Cat to his office which he opened the door to and left it open for Cat. Flickin' on the lights, Kode took another seat at his chair he always used since being here. There was plenty of seating for Cat.


[3/4/2025 11:24 PM] Narration
The office was different. Dylan was nowhere in sight, and a new set of equipment was now present; Crutches.


[3/4/2025 11:28 PM] Cat Bayes
*Cat observed the changes in the office before finding a spot to sit down, facing Kode.*


[3/4/2025 11:30 PM] Kode
**"In order to make sure things remain digestable.. I will allow you to ask the questions."** He opened up with.


[3/4/2025 11:32 PM] Cat Bayes
*That was a dangerous power to give to someone like her, Kode! But I digress, now wasn't the time for jokes, especially with everything Cat has been through in the past 24 hours.* **"Paige, what are your thoughts on her condition? Will she recover?"**


[3/4/2025 11:36 PM] Kode
**"Given the right medication and the time, yes. Her immune system is great since I made sure to restrict her use of cybernetics. But, I am afraid that we won't be given the time neccessary for recovery to happen. I'd give her another month to be at maybe 70."**


[3/4/2025 11:38 PM] Cat Bayes
**"Fuck...we don't have a month, much less a week."** *Cat muttered under her breath, just loud enough for Kode to hear. Her heel was already starting to tap at the floor.* **"What about Dylan, the CCR netrunner? Is she still here?"**


[3/4/2025 11:39 PM] Kode
**"Yes, I've been keeping tabs on her. Not pleased, but at least she understands the circumstances she's under."**


[3/4/2025 11:40 PM] Cat Bayes
**"Alright...I might try to talk to her later."** *She made a mental note of that, but continued her questions for now.* **"You said Mathias was doing better, I'm guessing that has to do with Freddie? Is he um...is he around?"**


[3/4/2025 11:48 PM] Kode
**"Freddie is able to acquire the things he needs to repair his arms. As for where Mathias is, I wouldn't be able to tell you. He rarely stays around long enough for me to ask him any questions."**


[3/4/2025 11:48 PM] Kode
**"Like now, I don't know where he is."**


[3/7/2025 2:54 PM] Cat Bayes
**"Yeah, no. That sounds like Mathias alright."** *Cat scoffed lightly, recalling the many times she couldn't locate the man at the old hideout.* **"But I'm sure whatever he's doing, he's doing it to help us out."**

*Her slight smile lowered as the other name came up in Kode's words: Freddie. Cat has no idea what went down during the time they were away, and it's about time she knew.* **"As for Freddie...did he tell you how he found this place?"**


[3/7/2025 5:53 PM] Kode
tapped his fingers against the surprisingly clean top of his counter for a moment before responding to the netrunner. **"Yeah, he did."** 

He immediately would go on to continue on that point. **"Look, Fred is a talented man but he isn't the most upstanding man — Never was until his daughter came into the picture. Things are only becoming more complicated with him and his daughter, Grace around. The poor girl doesn't know the half of it."** 

With a heavy sigh, he would shake his head. **"Enough of that though. There will certainly be more to come from their arrival."**


[3/7/2025 6:52 PM] Cat Bayes
**"...I-I see..."** *He didn't mention anything about Cole and what would happen to him, and that sent a strange sense of relief through Cat's mind. After what they'd just gone through, she didn't want to see anything bad happen to him on her account.* **"You said 'them', are they both here?"**

[3/7/2025 6:56 PM] Cat Bayes
**"Freddie and his Daughter, I mean."** *She clarified after a moment's silence.*


[3/7/2025 7:02 PM] Kode
**"Yes."** He'd look over towards the crutches, then back towards Cat as he groomed his beard with his right hand. **"They both are here under developing circumstances. But I am sure that your follow up questions will have that answered."**


[3/7/2025 7:12 PM] Cat Bayes
*The young netrunner shifted her gaze to the crutches that had been noticed previously before turning back to Kode. That must be what he meant by developing circumstances, and why Freddie was inclined to work with Horizon Grey. Well, Cat was just glad that the guy was on their side, at least.*

*Breathing out a sigh, she gave Kode a nod before continuing.* **"The Vesperian Legion, what are they really? Do you know if they're involved with the clone project with Biotek?"**


[3/7/2025 7:46 PM] Kode
Kode leaned back in his chair, exhaling sharply as if trying to shake off the weight of the conversation. **"They're soldiers. Their primary purpose? To take on the Brillion Armed Forces. They’ve got a presence in every district under Vespera’s control, no matter how small. Though, most of the time solely operating independent from the district governments."** He scratched the side of his head, shifting his weight as he crossed his legs again.

With a slow roll of his right hand—a casual conversational gesture—he continued, **"From what intel I gathered before coming here, Monita is the VL’s staging ground. Their ‘base camp.’ They manufacture the vehicles, the gear, the weapons—everything Vespera needs to sustain its war machine. It’s also the only port connecting affiliated districts with external partners. There’s an eternal war being fought, and whether people are ready for it or not, it’s coming home soon."**

Kode’s chair creaked slightly as he swiveled, his voice lowering just a touch.  **"BioTek is one of Vespera’s biggest military asset suppliers. If you’ve spent any time in the Haze or the districts we’ve taken refuge in, you’ll have seen their handiwork firsthand. In this case, you're brand new... Their clones... well, it’s a mixed bag. In Monita, the lesser drones? They’re not brainwashed, not exactly. They’re altered—reengineered—so that their only purpose is to serve the Exarchs. The clones in which you spoke of before when we had that 'team meeting'."** air quotes.

He paused, letting the weight of that settle.**"These Exarchs.... They’re not fully synthetic. They start off human—young, impressionable. Then they’re trained, shaped, conditioned to oversee the lesser drones or carry out operations that require more than just mindless obedience."**

Kode exhaled through his nose, shaking his head slightly. **"The worst cases? They blend in completely. Walking among the population, infiltrating, deceiving people like you and me.**


[3/7/2025 7:46 PM] Kode
**But those are rare. Maybe...3% at most. The rest... they’ve got anomalies. Something just slightly off. But in this day and age?"** He gave a dry chuckle. **"They’d just pass as another jumpjunkie. And the kicker? Most of them don’t even realize what they are."**


[3/7/2025 8:07 PM] Cat Bayes
*There was a burning sensation behind Cat's ears as she took in this critical information, the kinda stuff that most people would never hear in a lifetime. Augmented humans, trained from a young age and reconfigured to serve the "higher purpose" set out for them by their masters. Her fingers dug into her knees as her face went pale, a sickening look of realization overtaking her expression as she suddenly covered her mouth. She looked ready to puke.*

**"O-Oh god..."** *She whimpered quietly with a ragged breath, almost on the verge of tears. There was something more going on here than she was letting on.*

[3/7/2025 8:31 PM] Kode
Kode’s eyes flicked to Cat’s trembling hands, then back to her face. He didn’t flinch, didn’t soften, just let the weight of reality settle on her. **"Breathe. It’s a lot, but puking won’t change it."** His voice was even, steady—like he’d seen this reaction a hundred times before, but this was perhaps for the wrong reason... He let a beat pass before continuing, **"You’re gonna have to keep it together, because knowing this? It puts you in a whole different category. You don’t just walk away from it."**


[3/7/2025 8:39 PM] Cat Bayes
*For a moment there, the weight of the words she'd just took in had almost overwhelmed her with a dizzying sensation of...guilt? With her body shaking and breath ragged, it was only when Kode's words cut back into her torment that she was able to return to her senses properly. Taking a deep gulp, and exhaling afterwards...the shaking wasn't gone, but she seemed better than she was before.*

*Something else had replaced the panic in her eyes, a fire that Kode had probably seen before in Paige. There was determination, and anger...he was right, Cat can't just walk away from this anymore.* **"W-What if...Biotek was taken down? If the man responsible for the Vesperian Legion was killed?"** *She said as she looked back up to him, words somewhat ragged and strained. She could still taste the bile in her mouth.*


[3/7/2025 8:47 PM] Kode
He pulled the side of his lip downwards and to the side. Almost grimacing at the question. **"Then Brillion would fill in the void or worse Vespera would grow new heads. Perhaps, even worst than they are now."**


[3/7/2025 8:55 PM] Cat Bayes
**"..."** *She was quiet for a moment, almost as if gauging his words in lieu of her response. She needed to be absolutely sure of this before she went through with it. With how she was now, she could once again make a mistake that would lead to the deaths of millions, if not herself and her friends. Once again, that feeling of powerlessness began to creep into the back of her mind.* **"Benedict Kensington."** *Cat stated promptly, her somber eyes glaring a hole into the floor, like she was ashamed.*

**"I don't know for sure yet, but all signs point to him being the overseer of the entire project, or maybe a vital part of it..."** *She was fidgeting with her hand now, eyes darting about the room in search of something to distract herself.* **"That was the addendum to Quincy's deal, after I helped him solve his issue with Aurora King. He would get me close to Benedict so I could do...whatever I needed to."**


[3/7/2025 8:58 PM] Cat Bayes
**"...He's the man responsible for burning my shop to the ground, and the killings of twelve people who's names I don't even know."** *She'd stop fidgeting with her fingers now, and moved her hand up to hold her forehead, clutching the bangs of blue locks that'd fallen in front of her face.* **"I don't know if I could stop myself, Kode. I don't know what to do."**

[3/7/2025 9:09 PM] Kode
Kode watched her carefully, his usual sharp gaze narrowing as the weight of her words settled between them. He had seen this before—rage simmering beneath fear, the kind of grief that hardened into something dangerous. And he knew exactly where it led. 

He exhaled slowly through his nose, resting his forearms on his knees. **"You don't know what to do?"** He repeated, voice steady, measured. **"Then don't move yet."** His fingers tapped against his leg as he studied her, weighing whether she was about to spiral or steel herself. **"You're angry. You want justice—vengeance, maybe—but you can't afford to be reckless. Not with this. Not with him."** He let the words settle, not out of cruelty but out of necessity. **"Paige has done the same thing, believe it or not and __we__ know the outcome of that."** (Paige is pretty open with Kode it seems.)

**"Look, this guy, he's got the weight of BioTek and Vespera behind him. You get one shot, Cat. If you take it before you're ready, you'll just be another name on his list. __This Quincy guy could be using your potential blind anger as a way for you to self-destruct yourself. Get yourself killed so he wouldn't have to lift a finger in an effort to close loose ends.__"**

He leaned forward slightly, lowering his voice. **"I've seen people burn their lives down chasing revenge. You wanna kill him if you had the cleanest shot at his chrome dome? Fine. Maybe he deserves it."** His lips pressed into a thin line. **"But ask yourself this: what happens after? What happens when the power vacuum he leaves behind gets filled by something worse as I mentioned before?"**

[3/7/2025 9:26 PM] Cat Bayes
*Once again, Kode's wisdom managed to slowly bring Cat back down from what would've likely been her self destruction - and more than likely the destruction of her team, her family. By the time she'd look back up to Kode, there were tears gradually streaming down her cheeks, accompanied by what seemed like somber reassurance. Her eyes naturally darted about the room a few times before she started wiping her face with her sleeve, trying to dry her tears with a couple sniffles in between.*

**"Y-Yeah!"** *She stammered. She seemed to be in the process of relieving a bunch of emotions at once, but it seemed Kode was successful in putting the girl in check.*

[3/7/2025 9:36 PM] Kode
Kode watched her, his expression softening just a fraction, but he didn’t move to comfort her. He let her have this moment—let her process it on her own terms. That was how people got stronger.

He gave her a small nod, acknowledging her effort to pull herself together. **"Good."** His voice wasn’t unkind, but it carried a quiet authority. **"No one's asking you to be a __machine__. Feel it. Process it. But don’t let it own you."** 

He stood up, stretching his arms briefly before rolling his shoulders back, looking at her more directly now. **"We start with information. Can't do that until you do this job for the CCR Agent... If Kensington is the one pulling the strings as you say, we need to know what he knows. Where he moves. Who’s protecting him. We don’t act until we have the full picture. No partial picture, no assumptions. And certainly not without the team's consent."**

Kode didn’t linger too long on the emotions in the room—he knew better. Instead, he gestured toward the door with a subtle tilt of his head. **"Get your head on straight. And if you need someone to keep you from going too far, I got your back. We'll talk more later — oh I almost forgot since we were talking"** He would reach into the cabinet and take out a pill bottle and shaking a few tablets out of it. **"I have to give Paige her meds for the evening."**


[3/7/2025 10:12 PM] Cat Bayes
*A machine, nobody was asking her to be a __machine__. Those words resonated heavily with Cat in ways Kode nor any other member of Horizon Grey would understand. Perhaps in due time, when it was right, but not now...she couldn't go back there yet. For the time being, Cat had to keep moving forward, supporting her family as best she could.*

*By the time Kode finished breaking down how they should move forward, Cat had managed to finish drying her tears. She was calm now, and able to process his words with a couple of nods to show that she was following along. She'll have to talk to the rest of the team once they were out of this volatile situation. For now, they had to get to a stable condition, and that meant getting the hell out of Haven Heights before they were blown to smithereens.*

*Afterwards, Cat noted the bottle of medicine in Kode's hand as she stood up, looking his way.* **"I can take them to her, if that's okay with you."** *She offered.* **"I wanted to go see her anyways."**


[3/7/2025 11:00 PM] Kode
Kode turned towards Cat with a moment of hesitation, but ultimately extended his hand with the tablets. **"Here, I am sure she would be eager to see you. She has been awfully loney. There is only so much her old man can do before it becomes stale."** He'd chuckle dryly.


[3/7/2025 11:07 PM] Cat Bayes
*Cat received the medication from him before accompanying his chuckle with one of her own, giving him a friendly pat on the arm.* **"Ah, come on man. Don't sell yourself short like that."** *She said with a lighter demeanor than she had previously.* **"You know she loves her old man, and I can see why."**


[3/7/2025 11:08 PM] Kode
**"Yeah... no kiddin. If you don't mind either, check on that Dylan kid. On the room to the left at the end of the hallway you guys have your spaces."**


[3/7/2025 11:15 PM] Cat Bayes
**"Roger that, maybe I can give her some much needed netrunner gossip to lighten her mood."** *She teased with a wink, before turning to leave the room.*

*After closing the door, however...she didn't go straight to Paige's room. Instead, she stopped almost immediately outside of Kode's office and leaned her back against the wall, her head following shortly after. A deep exhale escaped her lips, her thoughts going back to what Kode told her about the drones and the Vesperian Legion. It weighed on her mind heavily - not enough to cripple - but enough to keep itself known.*

*She needed answers to a question she's been running from for a long time, and she'll get them. It's whether or not she __wants__ to is the real question.*

*No, enough of that, Cat. She shook the thoughts away before pushing herself off the wall...for now, she needs to focus on what's in front of her, and that's Paige.*


[3/7/2025 11:52 PM] Narration
As Cat stepped into Paige’s room, the lights were dim, casting soft shadows across the small space.


[3/7/2025 11:52 PM] Paige
There she was—sitting on the edge of the bed, her posture tense, her hands loosely resting on her lap. Even in the low light, Cat could see the subtle tremors running through her arms, an involuntary shake that never quite stopped. It wasn't violent, but it was constant, like a ghost of the impact still lingering in her nerves. Her new cybernetic eye flickered slightly, adjusting in real-time as it settled on Cat. The other, her older cybernetic eye, was bloodshot but alert, carrying a weight that painkillers alone couldn’t dull.

She looked… exhausted. The heavy-duty meds had taken the edge off, but they couldn’t completely erase the ache woven into every movement she made. Her legs, wrapped in bandages and stabilization braces, dangled just slightly off the floor. It was clear she had pushed herself to sit up—maybe out of frustration, maybe out of sheer stubbornness—but even that small act had taken effort.

Paige's lips twitched upward into the faintest smirk when she saw Cat, but it barely reached her eye. **"Took you long enough."** Her voice was hoarse, likely from the mix of medication and the strain of keeping herself upright. She shifted slightly, grimacing as the movement sent another ripple of involuntary shakes through her limbs.

Her fingers twitched, trying to tighten into a fist, but they wouldn’t fully cooperate. Instead, she exhaled sharply, letting them fall open again. **"You here to babysit me, or did Kode finally admit he’s a bore and send you for entertainment?"**

There was an unusual bite in her words, the familiar humor but it was sad—weaker than usual, like she was holding it together by sheer force of will.


[3/8/2025 12:30 AM] Cat Bayes
*It took everything in Cat's power not to flinch at the sight of Paige, only adding more weight to the thoughts and feelings she held prior to this meeting. But despite it all, she was still able to crack a slight smile at her war-wounded sister, holding up the near empty bottle of medication and giving it a rattle.* **"Both, actually."** *She joked as she moved closer.* **"They really fucked you up, huh girl...?"**

*She carefully sat beside her sister, moving slow as not to agitate her aching nerves as she started to open the bottle.* **"Y'know, you should really try to get some rest."** *It was all she could think to say. She hated seeing her like this, and Paige could probably tell.*


[3/8/2025 12:42 AM] Paige
Paige let out a dry, breathy chuckle, her smirk lingering but weak. **"Yeah, no shit."** She flexed her fingers again, watching them tremble as if they weren’t even her own. **"They did try to kill us right then and there."**

Her gaze flicked to the bottle in Cat’s hand, then back up to her face. She could see it—how much Cat hated this. How much it hurt her to see Paige like this.

**"Rest, huh?"** She scoffed, shifting her position ever so slightly, her legs tensing as she tried to find a more stable way to sit. **"That’d be real nice, but lying down just makes it worse half the time. Feels like my whole body’s on fire, like my nerves are still stuck in the tumble."** She swallowed, her jaw tightening. **"Doesn’t matter if I’m drugged to hell or not, it’s always there. Sitting up sucks, but at least I don’t feel like I’m drowning in my own skin."**

Her cybernetic eye flickered slightly out of sync with the undamaged one, adjusting as she turned to glance at Cat.  **"And besides..."** Her voice dipped, quieter now. **"Sleeping means dreaming. And I really don’t wanna see that shit right now."**


[3/8/2025 12:56 AM] Cat Bayes
*The lid opened, and Cat slowly poured the required amount of pills into the palm of her hand, staring at them for a moment. She listened closely to what Paige was saying, taking in and noting every detail of how she felt in this moment. She had to know, not because she was curious...but because Paige was her friend, her sister.* **"Yeah, I know where you're coming from, sis..."**

*She reached for a nearby glass of water after setting the pill bottle down on the side table, looking over at Paige.* **"Do you need me to- uh..."** *She paused, unsure of how to phrase it.*


[3/8/2025 3:30 PM] Paige
Paige waved off Cat's suggestion with a subtle gesture; a faint wave of her arm as she declined the question. **"Nah... I can do it."** She asserts, slowly holding her hands out for the pills and the glass.


[3/11/2025 9:42 PM] Cat Bayes
*Nodding, she carefully dropped the pills into her sister's palm, then handing the glass to her once she was confident enough in her ability to hold it. She meanwhile remained on standby in case she needed help.*


[3/11/2025 9:46 PM] Paige
Paige brought the pills up to her mouth and allowed them to tumble behind her lips. Next, she brought her second hand in to hold the side of the glass as a brace and slowly lifted it up to her lips. She continued to have temors and shakes as Paige did this, but managed to take her medication.

Paige sighed once she felt the cool water go down her throat. It was a refreshing feeling against the claminess of her own body. **"Those pills taste like fuckin' shit."**


[3/11/2025 9:47 PM] Cat Bayes
**"Heh, yeah I bet."** *Cat chuckled as she took the glass from her hand and placed it back on the side table, turning her attention back to her friend.* **"But they make you feel better, so doctor's orders until you're back to 100%, got it?"**


[3/11/2025 9:50 PM] Paige
There was a pull of her lips, a hint of a geninuine smile peeking through the blinds. **"As long as they don't make me feel worst, I'll take almost anything."**


[3/11/2025 10:00 PM] Cat Bayes
*That slight smile, miniscule as it was, was contagious enough for Cat's own lips to curl into a warming smile as well. She wanted to give her a pat on the back, or maybe a cute little side hug, but it's probably best she didn't if Paige's body was aching. For now, she just gave her a cheeky thumbs up!* **"Atta girl! Keep that mentality up and you'll be back on your feet in no time!"**


[3/11/2025 10:02 PM] Paige
**"Thanks, I hope."** Paige said hopefully, though as soon as she accepted the optimistic words, Paige had something lingering on her mind as well. **"Everything on your end going okay?"**


[3/11/2025 10:07 PM] Cat Bayes
**"Ah..."** *Oh, right...Cat almost forgot about all the crazy shit going down with her after seeing Paige. She tried her best not to let her smile falter, but the little twitch of her eyes might be a sign for Paige.* **"Oh, y'know..."** *For a brief moment, Cat thought about covering up everything that's been happening to her recently...but she couldn't do that to her sister.*

*With a sigh, she resigned herself to as much of the truth as she was willing to share.* **"...It's been a pretty crazy day, all things considered."** *She started.* **"There's a lot going down right now, and it doesn't look like we'll be getting a moment to rest once shit creek turns into shit tsunami."**


[3/11/2025 10:13 PM] Paige
**"..."** Paige's frown deepened, hearing the words come from Cat's end. Things certainly were not suppose to go down like this and it most definitely was not improving based off of what she was hearing. 

**"I've... given it some thought since I cannot really do anything else but think—and I—"** She stopped her self, closing her mouth and twisting in a bid to stop whatever nonsense she was about to spew. **"Nevermind... I am just not feeling good. I am going to lie down."**


[3/11/2025 10:18 PM] Cat Bayes
*Cat looked over towards her, the strained curiosity plain in her expression. She wanted so desperately to ask what was wrong, but it was clear that Paige didn't want to talk about it...at least not yet. Weighing the options in her mind, she eventually settled for something that can atleast bridge both gaps.* **"I...I understand."** *She nodded before standing up, turning her upper body to face Paige.* **"I'm your sis, Paige, I'll always listen to you."**


[3/11/2025 10:22 PM] Paige
Paige lowered herself onto her mattress, wincing considerably since the medication did not kick in just yet. **"Of course... You're the best."** She said between sharp inhales. **"Oh, wow... I am dizzy... I'll talk to you soon."**


[3/11/2025 10:35 PM] Cat Bayes
**"Yeah, sleep well, Sis."** *Cat finished with a smiling nod, before exiting the room.*

*Once she'd left and closed the door, she had to take a moment to breathe against the wall. Covering the upper half of her face with her hand, she exhaled deeply with a clenched fist at her side. Paige didn't deserve this, it wasn't fair, she hated every moment her sister was left in pain like this.*

*That's when an idea slowly began to formulate in her mind. With the realization slowly dawning on her face, she began to make her way down the hall to Dylan's room while she continued to cook.*

*Oh, speaking of which.*


[3/11/2025 10:36 PM] Cat Bayes
*Cat stopped midway through, pulling up her contact info before giving Digi a ring.*


[3/11/2025 10:42 PM] Digit
`"Good to hear from you Cat."` Digit would respond rather quickly. Probably sitting in his usual booth smoking as usual.


[3/11/2025 10:46 PM] Cat Bayes
`"Same here, Digi."` *Cat greeted back with a sigh of relief. She remembered when the fixer used to intimidate her, but now? The guy's honestly grown on her.* `"Although I wish I was calling with some better news."`


[3/11/2025 10:48 PM] Digit
There was a pause, the hit of his hookah. `"What you got that has you callin'?"`


[3/11/2025 10:55 PM] Cat Bayes
*Hoh boy, time to lay the motherlode.* `"Hope you're sitting down, choom."` *He probably was.*

`"Long story short, the corpos have gone completely apeshit, they're dismantling the CCR and replacing them with their new Vesperian Legion: some kind of augmented, mindless drone army that they have total control over..."` *She paused for a moment to let that sink in.*

`"And for whatever reason, they've decided that they want to wipe Haven Heights and Fairview clean off the map."` *A mental image of her sister flashed in her mind, her teeth clenching slightly before she continued.* `"They already made an example of our old hideout, Paige got caught in the blast."`


[3/11/2025 10:58 PM] Narration
There was an extended pause between the two. One that was long enough to have them question if the other was still on the line...


[3/11/2025 10:58 PM] Digit
`"I was wondering what became of her. She has not answered any of my messages or calls... Is she..."` He wanted Cat to fill in the blanks.


[3/11/2025 10:59 PM] Cat Bayes
`"Alive, thank God."` *Cat confirmed.* `"But she's in...pretty bad shape, I wouldn't be expecting anything from her for the time being."`


[3/11/2025 11:11 PM] Digit
`"I'm aware of the CCR's disbandment. It's gradual, but its occuring, like you said. Nico is proficient at keeping the forecast of shifts, but these bombings are a new revelation. I will have to see what Nico has to say on the matter."`

Pause,

`"What of you? Looking to skip out on the district?"`


[3/11/2025 11:15 PM] Cat Bayes
`"Yeah, not much of another choice in the matter, choom."` *Cat sighed, leaning her shoulder against the wall as she folded her arms, eyes tracking the floor.*

`"Might be a good idea to start getting ready for evacuation too, see if you can't move your people out of Haven Heights."`

`"C.Y.A"` *An acronym one might associate to Cya, but rather stands for "Cover your Ass". With that, Cat hung up the call and breathed out a sigh. That's another thing off the list, time to handle the last thing before returning to Kode.*

*Making her way down the hall, she reached the door leading into Dylan's room and gave it a quick knock.* **"Hey, Dylan was it? Mind if I come in?"** *She called out.*


[3/11/2025 11:34 PM] Narration
**"C-come in.."** A timid voice responded to Cat!


[3/11/2025 11:38 PM] Cat Bayes
*Alright, that's a start at least! Twisting the handle, she slowly opened the door and peeked inside, searching for the kid.*


[3/11/2025 11:45 PM] Dylan Hackett
Dylan was sitting on the floor in the center of the room. Her knees were together as her legs from the knees down laid flat against the ground. To support her upper body, Dylan was holding her hands out behind her. 

Her gaze was quizzical, this was one of the few times Dylan was exposed to Cat and did not have a good read on the netrunner. 

**"Did I do something wrong?"** was the first thing she said to Cat. Worried that she somehow angered her or anyone else.


[3/11/2025 11:48 PM] Cat Bayes
**"Oh! No, no no no!"** *She immediately clarified, waving her hands as she stepped into the room!* **"You're okay! I just wanted to come check on you, see how you were doing."**

*She was still standing by the door, not entering the room proper lest she makes the poor girl uncomfortable.* **"I'm going to stay right here, kay? You've got nothing to be afraid from me."**


[3/11/2025 11:51 PM] Dylan Hackett
Dylan relaxed considerably, but she kept her eyes on Cat—weary of anything that might occur. **"I'm alright, I suppose."** The junior netrunner's gaze finally broke from Cat's and looked down at the table before her. 

There was a datapad she had been using for entertainment. Since she could not contact the outside world with her neural deck, she had to find something to do while in captivity. **"Has there been a decision on what will happen with me?"**


[3/12/2025 12:01 AM] Cat Bayes
*Cat looked down at the datapad, assuming that Kode had given it to her for entertainment reasons. At least she wasn't being driven insane with boredom, that'd probably take all of Cat's nine lives if she were in her shoes.* **"Well, I'm glad you're doing...well enough, all things considered."** *Those things just might happen to be her fault, whoops.*

*She looked off to side, scratching the back of her head awkwardly to that question.* **"Not...yet. As much as I'd love to make you sign an NDA and send you home...well, neither Haven Heights nor Fair View aren't gonna be looking like home for much longer."** *This girl had a right to know what was going on, even if she didn't believe her.*


[3/12/2025 12:03 AM] Dylan Hackett
**"What..?"** Her eyes widened subtly. What was Cat talking about?


[3/12/2025 12:05 AM] Cat Bayes
*She breathed out of her nostrils, readying herself to deliver the bad news for the umpteenth time today. It never came out any easier the more she said it.* **"The corpos have decided that we're no longer worth the trouble. They're dismantling the CCR and replacing them with their shiny new Vesperian Legion, and after that..."**

**"They're sending in their fleet to wipe Haven Heights and Fairview off the map."**


[3/12/2025 12:16 AM] Dylan Hackett
Dylan's stomach dropped.

She had been prepared for a lot of things—interrogation, isolation, even a cruel decision about her fate—but not this.

Her breath hitched in her throat as Cat's words sank in, her fingers curling against the floor. The weight of it all pressed down on her chest like a vice, making it hard to breathe. Her family—her home—everything she knew was about to be gone?

She shook her head slightly, as if trying to dispel the thought, but the room suddenly felt smaller, suffocating. *No, no, no...* this had to be a lie. Some kind of manipulation tactic, some cruel way to get her to cooperate. But Cat... Cat looked exhausted? This wasn't some power play.

Her body started to tremble, barely perceptible at first, but then growing more noticeable as panic took root. Her hands clenched into fists.

Her voice cracked when she finally spoke. **"T-that can't be true."** She barely heard her own self over the pounding in her ears. **"Fairview... my family is there. They—they can't just—"** She suddenly stopped.

Dylan had spent so much of this time keeping herself composed, surviving by pushing emotions down and staying focused. But this—this was beyond anything she had prepared herself for.

She wanted to scream. To run. To *do something.* But she was stuck in this room, stuck in this nightmare, had she been able to go home that night, none of this would have happened. All she could do was stare at Cat with wide, terrified eyes, waiting for her to take it back.


[3/12/2025 12:29 AM] Cat Bayes
*Cat slowly made her way forward, getting on to a knee so that she was eye level with her, resting an arm on said knee. God, she reminded her way too much of herself.* **"Hey, look at me...okay? I know it's a lot - trust me, I still don't believe myself when I say it out loud - but..."** *She stopped herself, it was hard to comfort someone she barely even knew...much less kidnapped, in the first place. Nevertheless, she had to try.*

**"...But I guess I can't promise anything, huh?"** *She continued, speaking softly with guilt sparkling plainly in her eyes.* **"You've probably got a lot of 'What If's' going on in your head, I know the feeling, that's kinda just been the last month for me. Hell, we're the whole reason you're stuck in the mess to begin with."**

*The netrunner shifted her legs until she was sitting cross legged in front of Dylan, back hunched forward and eyes closed.* **"You said your family was in Fairview? I'm actually heading there after this - and I know I'm not exactly the first person you can trust in a situation like this - but I feel like I owe it to you to help in some way."**


[3/12/2025 12:30 AM] Cat Bayes
*Was she an idiot for this? Probably, but she'd rather be an idiot than watch history repeat itself. She can't watch another fire burn this girl's life away, always mourning the people she could've saved.*

[3/13/2025 1:13 PM] Dylan Hackett
Dylan's breath was still shaky, her mind spiralling with every possible worst-case scenario, but she forced herself to focus on Cat. The older netruner had  moved closer, speaking softly, looking...  guilty? That was unexpected. 

She didn't trust Cat—not really. How could she? Cat and her people were the reason she was here, cut off from the world, powerless while everything was falling apart. But there was something in her voice, in her expression, that didn't feel like an act. This was an opprotunity.

**"You're really going there?"** she asked, her eyes narrowing slightly, not with hostility, but skeptiisim. **"To Fairview? Then... if you really mean that..."** She exhaled sharply, frustrated with herself for even asking—for hoping. **"Then, I need to get out of here.."**

Dylan wasn’t naïve. She knew this might be empty reassurance, that Cat might just be saying what she wanted to hear. But if there was even the slightest chance that she meant it—then she had to take it.


[3/13/2025 1:57 PM] Cat Bayes
*Her eyes widened a bit before narrowing, a series of conflicted emotions running through her as she mulled over the question. Sure, it'd probably be better if the girl was with her family, but how could they trust her not to give up their location, or some other vital information to the CCR? Even if the police force was being disbanded soon, it didn't mean they still weren't a threat.* **"That's...not something I can decide."** *She finally said, slowly.*

**"I'm sorry, I'd like to get you out of here as soon as possible, but things are...in a pretty volatile state right now."** *She paused, circling her kneecap with the tip of her thumb as she thought about it a bit more. There's gotta be a compromise here, somehow.* **"I'll talk to the guy in charge right now, but I can't promise anything at the moment. If it doesn't work out, is there anything you'd like me to tell your family?"**


[3/13/2025 2:14 PM] Dylan Hackett
Dylan deflated as Cat brought down the immediate judgement hammer. It was a chance worth taking in her eyes. When Cat asked about leaving a message for her family, this prompted Dylan to lock up. 

The last thing she wanted was for any of these...terrorist from contacting her family. Sure, Cat seemed well-intended. But, like she said—she doesn't call the shots. They could use the information she knew to their advantage... But, how desperate was Dylan truly?

**"I....nevermind. I would much rather not."** She replied with, lowering her head slightly.


[3/23/2025 2:25 PM] Cat Bayes
**"I..."** *Understand? How could she possibly reflect with the girl that she had a part in kidnapping? The netrunner bit her inner lip for a moment as she struggled to find the right words to say to her, but a lot of what she came up with fell short or felt like empty promises. A familiar guilt was welling up inside Cat once more, something she felt with Paige and Cole not too long ago.*

*After a while, the tension seemed to fade from her expression as she slumped over with a dry chuckle.* **"Yeah, I suppose I'd probably be the last person you'd want to see your family, huh?"** *She surmised, her half lidded eyes hanging lowly, tracking the grout lines and cracks in the floor.* **"This whole situation is fucked beyond the meaning of the word, and frankly it's a miracle I haven't lost my shit yet."**

*This time, she brought her eyes back up to Dylan, a somber determination reflecting back towards the younger hacker. Like it was her last ditch effort to break through.* **"But let me tell you this, if I don't warn your family, and this whole bombing thing *really* happens? We're not going to get another chance to save them. I don't have to get close to them, maybe just enough to give them a message from you, or something. I owe you that much."**


[3/23/2025 7:26 PM] Dylan Hackett
Dylan kept her head down throughout time Cat was speaking to her. Her bangs masking the emotions flashing across her face. It was a gamble, an extremely risk-riddled gamble. 

There was a source of truth in Cat's words—if she withholds the information than there was very little going for her family to know of their impending doom. Though, in the back of her mind the bombing couldn't happen overnight. If it were the case, they would be far more frantic and pressed for time. *There was time to mull it over, at least...*

Dylan exhaled deeply, refusing to lift her head to Cat. **"I need some time to think about it."**


[3/30/2025 6:36 PM] Cat Bayes
*Cat gave her an understanding nod, pushing her hands onto her knees as she stood up.* **"I understand, but I'll be leaving soon."** *She warned, looking down at the younger netrunner.* **"I can give you an hour, no more than that."**

*It felt a little mean to hoist such a heavy choice on her in that little bit of time, but unfortunately...time wasn't a luxury that Cat had. They needed to do this before they could evacuate from Haven Heights, and there was potentially a way to find medicine for Paige while she was there.*

*First things first, she needs to talk to Kode to figure out her next move. For now, she turned to the door and began to make her way out of the room, turning back to Dylan for a moment.* **"I meant it when I said I wanna get you out of here, Dylan. I'm not sure when it'll happen, but..."** *She paused for a moment.* **"...We'll get you back to a normal life, soon."**


[3/30/2025 7:45 PM] Dylan Hackett
Dylan lowered her eyes just enough where Cat's face was outside of her vision. **"I believe you... I'll give you my answer in an hour."**

*With that, Cat left the room and closed the door behind her. There's still some time before she had to go, so for now it was back off to Kode's room to devise a plan.*


[3/30/2025 8:54 PM] Dylan Hackett
The door came to a close and Dylan furrowed her brow... What Cat had said to her and how she made Dylan felt rubbed her in an uncomfortable way.

This was a bad thing, because now she was having second thoughts about what she was __about__ to do. The datapad she had on the table was the source of concern as she pulled it towards herself. The screen woke up and on the screen wasn't an UI interface one would expect, but a console. *She was jailbreaking it*... Or at least trying to.

`("It won't be long until I can break through the dated software on this thing... Once I do that, I could...")` 

Should she go fourth with this? She had an hour to figure that out...


[3/30/2025 9:24 PM] Narration
Cat returned to Kode's office where he was talking with someone Cat had never met before in person. His back was towards her until both men heard the sliding door open and ultimately focus on the disturbance.


[3/30/2025 9:24 PM] Fred Dawson
**"*__This__* is the netrunner you were talking about?"** Freddie inquired, gesturing towards Cat as he looked towards Kode.

Kode exasperated, running his thumb and index finger horziontally across his brow. Some things just do not change. **"Yes.."**


[3/30/2025 9:43 PM] Cat Bayes
*Walking into the room, she almost immediately spotted the stranger talking to Kode. Her eyes glanced over towards Kode as if asking who this was for a moment...before she connected the dots.* **"Are you...Freddie?"** *She asked carefully.*

[3/30/2025 9:47 PM] Fred Dawson
**"Uhuh."** His grunt was gruff and unpleaseant to the ear, like old gears grinding.  

**"You're about my daughter's age. Are you of any use or are you simply Paige's dead weight?"** The question was candid and for most, unwarranted to be asked in the first place.


[3/30/2025 9:54 PM] Cat Bayes
*Cat's eyes narrowed in annoyance, she resisted the urge to breathe a frustrated sigh from her nose as she nodded over towards Kode.* **"I'm the reason our resident ripperdoc's not rotting in a cell right now, and I'm *really* not in the mood to be taking this kinda shit right now...choomba."** *She added at the end, folding her arms defiantly.*


[3/30/2025 10:05 PM] Fred Dawson
**"..."** Fred's own eyes narrowed beneath his orange dyed glasses. Evaluating Cat and her words.

**"You bark like Felicity."** He remarks before turning his attention back towards Kode. **"I can make calls if its medicine you need. But getting them will be a problem since our best friend decided to nuzzle up with the others. Think about it."** With that, Fred did not give neither of them a moment more of his time as he walked past Cat without a second glance.


[3/30/2025 10:12 PM] Cat Bayes
*That comment about Felicity caught her off guard for a moment before she noticed him moving past her. Stepping out of his way, she turned back to Kode with a confused look on her face.* **"So...What was that all about?"**


[3/30/2025 10:14 PM] Kode
**"Fred isn't a socilite. Don't pay him much mind."** Kode told Cat as he turned back to his desk, sorting through medications tablets and stem pens.


[3/30/2025 10:17 PM] Kode
**"We were just talking about our medicine situation. We have __three__ individuals here who need specific medications. Ones we can't get through our current channels."**


[3/30/2025 10:19 PM] Cat Bayes
**"That's...actually something I wanted to talk to you about."** *Cat made her way further into the room, finding a chair and sitting down in front of Kode.* **"Fairview, would it have the medicine we need to help the others?"**


[3/30/2025 10:23 PM] Kode
**"Yes, but we are talking medications that only the hospitals would carry. All of which are secured to the teeth. I had access until I was unfortunately dragged from my place of work."**

**"Fred was referring to Danny's wife who has or maybe in this case had a direct connection to the pharmacies."**


[3/30/2025 10:25 PM] Cat Bayes
**"Danny, I think I remember his name from Felicity's old computer..."** *She mulled over that name for a moment before looking back up.* **"What's stopping Freddie from calling Danny's wife? Did something happen to them?"**


[3/30/2025 10:28 PM] Kode
Kode continued sorting, dropping tablets into cups. **"Fred tells me he could not get a hold of her. She's either dead or they replaced her neural deck and assigned a new unique biometric ID, which is unlikely. Or simply had someone on the inside of the telecommunications to reject all communications."**

**"I'm not savy with netrunning nonsense, or the engineering behind it. So anything relating to Stephanie, Dan's wife, why he cannot contact them or how, would come from Fred himself."**


[3/30/2025 10:35 PM] Cat Bayes
*Great, so if she wanted any info on how to get the medicine, she'd have to talk to Freddie again. After that __wonderful__ first impression he made on her in their first meeting, she __really__ didn't want to interact with him again.*

*But she doesn't have that kind of luxury right now. Paige's life is in danger, the over-the-counter shit she's on right now can only work for so long. She needs to step the fuck up.* **"...Alright, I'll talk to him about it."** *She sighed.*

-# Still doesn't mean she has to like it.

*Leaning back in the seat, she racked her brain for a moment. They had options here, and they'll have to play their cards right if they wanna get out of this mess.* **"What about Quincy's deal, think we can use that to get something out of Biotek? They aughta have something that could help Paige and the others, right?"**


[3/30/2025 10:43 PM] Kode
**"Bidding everything on a CCR official is quite the risky venture. Yes, the CCR technically has insider knowledge and connections with the businesses within District 9.. But these large corpos don't truly bend the knee to them at the same time. A mutual respect system if you think about it my way."** Kode slid a cup off to the side and began work on another one.

**"Let's keep our options open."**


[3/30/2025 11:00 PM] Cat Bayes
**"Alright, alright..."** *She nodded, her head drooping to the floor a bit. It was probably clear to Kode that Cat was a little stressed about this whole thing, but she was still trying to maintain her composure.* **"I'm still gonna try to get to Fairview and do his little errand. He knows about our hideout location, and I'd rather not be in debt to a man like that."** 

**"While I'm over there, I'll see if I can't look into a way to get our hand on some medication, or maybe Stephanie if I can get Fred to work with me."**


[3/30/2025 11:03 PM] Kode
**"Sounds like a solid plan. I'll make sure to hold down the fort until you get back."**


[3/30/2025 11:08 PM] Cat Bayes
*Cat gave the ripperdoc a smile and an affirming nod, a small sense of relief washing over her for a moment. Before she remembered her other question. Yeah, gotta clear this one up as well.*

**"One last thing...about Dylan,"** *She paused for a moment, internally cringing at the awkward start.* **"I know this sounds like a really stupid idea, but when do you think we'd be able to let her go? We can't just keep her hostage here forever, can we?"**


[3/30/2025 11:19 PM] Kode
With a dragged out sigh, it was a solid confirmation that this weighted heavily on his mind, and recently too. He took a minor break from his sorting to think it over while he had Cat here. **"There is a risk associated with everything we do and don't do with her."** He swiveled his chair towards Cat. **"Hypothetically, if we do release her. We have no guarantee she won't give up our location and other facts she might have gathered about us. Remember, she was involved with the CCR as the next person was. Willingly or through interrogation? I'm confident her superiors would __love__ to find out."**

**"If we keep her here, then we can keep an eye on her. But that in itself has risks tethered to this angle. She is likely to find weaknesses and exploit them if it means she can escape. Anything that is caged will seek to break free one way or another."** 

Kode then brought one of his legs and pulled it so that his lower leg rested horizontal to his other knee. **"Conviencing her to join us ties into my latter point, but again, who's to say she wouldn't betray us later down the line. Like Mercer."**


[3/30/2025 11:29 PM] Cat Bayes
*A lump formed in her throat upon the mention of Mercer. Yeah, it had to come up eventually and she honestly should've seen this coming, but now it was time to bite the bullet. This was her fuck-up after all, and she had to tell someone.* **"Y-Yeah...about that."**

*She took a nervous gulp, leaning forward in the chair like she was about to admit to her parents that she's been taking their car out for joyrides every night.* **"Cole betrayed us because of...because of me. It's my fuckup."**


[3/30/2025 11:42 PM] Kode
Kode raised both his hands in a deflecting manner. **"Doesn't matter when you sum it up... Look, I would be the first to tell you that this matter is out of my hands. But franky, it is not... To that end, I have to be the one to call the shots and decide if he stays or goes."** 

Then, his hands came down onto his legs.
**"He has done more damage than good and does not listen to reason. So, I vote that he goes and stays the hell away from my little girl and everyone else here."** Kode then nudged his head to the side. **"He can 'assist' from a distance. That is my verdict."**

[4/1/2025 5:45 PM] Cat Bayes
*Yeah, Cole kinda was all that and more, so she couldn't deny him there. Cat brought a hand up to her temple, breathing out a deep sigh after hearing Kode's judgement. She didn't really have a comeback prepared for what he said, and despite the circumstances, she was really hoping it wouldn't come to this.* 

**"I understand, I do..."** *She started, looking back up to the ripperdoc.* **"...I guess the only thing I can really say here is that he chose to protect me in those sewers. He could've killed me down there or left me for the purafish - but he chose to take care of the idiot girl who put a tracker in his equipment."**


[4/1/2025 5:46 PM] Cat Bayes
**"You're the boss right now, I don't wanna undermine your judgement."** *Cat scratched the back of her head, standing up from the chair.* **"But that's gotta count for something."**

[4/1/2025 6:47 PM] Kode
Kode turned his chair partially towards his desk. Just enough so he could comfortably scoop up the cup of pills he sorted before slowly standing before her. **"We will see if it counts soon enough, won't we?"** With that he would walk past her, patting her shoulder before moving to leave. **"He can stay until we find a way leave the district. If he acts up before that. Then, I'll personally make sure he can't be a hinderance, again."**

The door closed behind him.


[4/1/2025 6:52 PM] Cat Bayes
*As Kode left the room with that final warning, Cat couldn't help but smile a little. She liked Kode, he seemed like he was a good man with a good head on his shoulders. That, and he gave really good advice too - kept her from treading down the wrong path. She can work with the ultimatum he gave her, just have to make sure Cole doesn't get into any more trouble...on her account, specifically.*

*Then again, that was dependent on whether or not the mercenary still wanted to rock with them. At the end of the day, it was up to him after all. With a shrug, she left the room and made her way into the hall.*


[4/1/2025 7:04 PM] Cole Mercer
*As Cat exited the room, she would spot a tall man dressed in black, a full duffle bag slung over his shoulder. His disguise was working, almost too well. Less intimidating, more conventionally handsome, though that was subjective. He looked like an entirely different person, yet his attire remained unchanged. He hadn't given much thought to how the others would react, this wasn’t a dramatic return, just a stop to retrieve his belongings.*

*His steps were slow, deliberate, his focus locked on his objective. If Cat entered his line of sight, he wouldn’t acknowledge her unless she made a point to stop him...*


[4/1/2025 7:11 PM] Cat Bayes
*Well, he wasn't exactly hiding with footsteps like that, now was he? Without laying eyesight on the man, she could almost tell who it was just by how intimidating he sounded when he walked. Turning over, she motioned to greet the man in the hall.* **"Oh, Cole! You're just in-"**

*She stopped, finally noticing the stranger. For a moment, she froze - damn near reaching for her revolver.* **"W-Who are you? Are you with Quincy? Did that fucker go back on his word?!"** *Her eyes were panicked for a moment, but they quickly shifted to confusion once she caught sight of what the man was actually wearing. Weren't those Cole's clothes?*


[4/1/2025 7:15 PM] Cole Mercer
*Cole’s stride didn’t break as Cat’s voice rang out, but the sudden shift in her tone, panic, accusation, made him glance her way. He __exhaled sharply__ through his nose, unfazed but fully aware of the reaction he was causing. It wasn’t unexpected.*

**"Easy."** *His voice was level, cold, but unmistakably his.* **"It’s me."**  

*His eyes narrowed slightly, but beyond that, he barely reacted. Mercer saw no reason to retaliate.*


[4/1/2025 7:25 PM] Cat Bayes
**"What the fu-"** *Cat had whiplash hearing Cole's voice coming from the stranger's mouth, but her body did seem to relax a tad bit once she did hear it.* **"You uh...you got a haircut?"** *She asked, half-joking. He got a little more than just a trim it seemed, he looked completely different!*

**"What's up with the new look?"**


[4/1/2025 7:36 PM] Cole Mercer
*His expression remained flat, devoid of amusement or irritation.* **"Something like that,"** *he answered, his tone indifferent.* ***"Had to make some adjustments. My old face wasn’t safe anymore."**  

*That was all he offered. If she wanted more, she’d have to press for it.*


[4/1/2025 7:45 PM] Cat Bayes
**"Yeah, no- uh..."** *She coughed awkwardly, bringing her hands behind her back as she swayed back and forth on her heels.* **"That uh...that makes sense, I think? Don't want the CCR coming after you and all that."**


[4/1/2025 7:47 PM] Cole Mercer
*Cole gave a small nod, his gaze lingering on her for a moment before shifting back to the hallway ahead. Without another word, he continued toward his room, unless Cat intended to stop him again.*


[4/1/2025 7:54 PM] Cat Bayes
**"Freddie Dawson is here."** *Was all she said to him, rubbing her arm.* **"He told Kode what happened between you guys, and uh...how he found this place."**

*Nervously, she began to tap her foot against the ground before she continued.* **"Kode said you're allowed to stay with us until we're able to leave the district, but that's the only chance you're getting."**


[4/1/2025 7:58 PM] Cole Mercer
*Cole came to a gradual stop. His expression remained unreadable, but there was a weight behind his silence. Slowly, he turned his head just enough to glance at her from the corner of his eye.*

**"__I won't be here long.__"** *His tone was cold, detached, stating a fact, not an intention. Without another word, he resumed his path toward his room.*


[4/1/2025 8:04 PM] Cat Bayes
**"Ah-"** *It seemed like Cat wanted to say more, but she cut herself off. It was hard not feeling as if this was still her fault - the reason why Cole felt he had to leave them, but at this point there was nothing more she can do. Sighing with defeat, she called out to him once more.* **"I'm leaving for Fairview in an hour, if you still wanna tag along for that. Meet me in the garage when the time comes."**

*With that, she turned and began walking in the opposite direction in search of wherever Freddie was staying.*


[4/1/2025 8:08 PM] Cole Mercer
*Cole didn’t respond to her offer immediately, his back still turned as he walked away. He didn’t look back. The weight of her words, the hint of guilt in her voice, barely registered. He had his own path to follow, and it didn’t matter what was said now.* 

-# **"Fairview."** *He muttered to himself under his breath.*


[4/1/2025 8:21 PM] Narration
Cat did some digging around; Who would've guess the place that had what could be discerned as the sound of an electrical box shorting out would house Horizon Grey's most brilliant (engineering-wise) mind.

The room beside the generator chamber is a repurposed equipment maintenance room, maybe once intended for storage or minor repairs. Now, it’s Fred’s little kingdom of sparks and solder. It's dimly lit—by choice, not circumstance—so the glow from the generator cables and welding arcs becomes a part of the atmosphere. The hum of electricity is a constant companion here, accented by the occasional pop of flux or the hiss of cooling metal.

The space is cluttered but methodical, with several folding tables arranged into makeshift workbenches. Laid across them are half-assembled circuit boards, stripped-down gadgets, and an array of salvaged tech—clearly organized in a system that only Fred truly understands. The room smells of ozone, melted plastic, and metallic dust.

Along one wall, thick insulated cables snake in from a grommet punched through the concrete, humming faintly with energy stolen directly from the generator room next door. They feed into a hulking device Fred’s been building—its function unknown, but the size and effort involved suggest something ambitious.

Fred is perched on a rickety stool, welding visor down, focused entirely on his work. Sparks scatter across the tabletop as he solders two delicate wires together. A few tools hang from pegboard strips nailed to the wall, while others are magnetically stuck to a repurposed metal cabinet. There are only a handful of large boxes in the room—each one now a stripped carcass or meticulously unpacked container, their contents cannibalized and reborn into new, strange tech.

Despite the chaos, it’s clear this space is his. Every scratch and burn mark tells a story of something tried, something failed, and something learned. What was crazy was **He just got here.**


[4/1/2025 9:08 PM] Cat Bayes
*Cat walked into the room unsure of what to expect, almost getting distracted by the myriad of bits, bobs and doodads scattered about the place. It almost looked like her room, but less cables and computers and more nuts and bolts. Hell, if time wasn't so against them, she'd probably be pestering the old man, asking him millions of questions about every single small object littering his space - including that big...whatever it was. It looked so cool!*

*Wait, no. Focus Cat!*

**"A-Ahem...Uh, Freddie?"** *She called out to him, unsure of whether or not he could hear her with the mechanical noises prevalent in the room.*


[4/1/2025 9:14 PM] Fred Dawson
The welding immediately stopped when his name crossed the waves. With his head lifting, he would set down the piece he was working and lift his visor, all before turning his rigid body around to see that it was none other than the netrunner standing in front of him.

His eyes judged her for a brief moment before turning back around to continue his craft. **"What do you want now?"** He would ask, checking over his work.


[4/1/2025 9:21 PM] Cat Bayes
*"Yes, hi, hello Cat, so wonderful to finally meet you. I'm sorry for being a complete and total prick earlier, I totally slept wrong and now my creaking old bones sound like a wooden door in a haunted mansion!"*

*Cat disregarded that line of thinking as she rolled her eyes, shaking her head for a moment before taking a few steps further into the messy room.* **"Well uh...My name's Cat, if Kode hadn't already told you..."** *She introduced herself, trying to navigate her way through a decent conversation with this man.* **"I wanted to see if I could help you out...y'know, with finding the medicine for our friends?"**

{Reactions}
😭 (2)

[4/1/2025 9:30 PM] Fred Dawson
**"We know where the medicine is."** He said matter-of-factly. **"We just can't get to it with the Vesperian Legion stockpiling it for themselves and their __friends__."** 

**"What can a small-time netrunner possibily do against an entire army?"** He would question incredulously.


[4/1/2025 9:41 PM] Cat Bayes
*Cat took a moment to collect herself before responding. She could boast to him all she wanted about how she's been a thorn in the CCR's side ever since joining up, but that wasn't what she was fighting for her. She's not looking for his approval, she wants his __help saving her friend__.*

**"I'm not looking to fight an army, I've already seen the Vesperian Legion."** *She said, steeling her resolve.* **"Stephanie, Danny's wife. She can get us what we need, right?"**


[4/1/2025 10:01 PM] Fred Dawson
**"If we can get a hold of her."** He rose a circuit board into the air so he could inspect it better in the low light. 
**"I have a strong hunch she is alive and is with Slade. Do you even know who that is?"**


[4/2/2025 2:20 PM] Cat Bayes
*Slade, that name was brought up before, right after they broke Kode out of jail. She turned her head to the side, looking over at one of the doodads he had lying around.* **”Yeah, pretty nasty fellow from what I heard. Been told to give a wide berth.”**


[4/2/2025 4:14 PM] Fred Dawson
**"He's a nutjob, but he has his moments where he could be resourceful."** He admitted. **"Slade would be the first one to jump into a sink hole or blast his way into a military base by himself."** He would rise from his chair and walk towards **the** large device, minding his step as he walked over the large electrical harnesses. **"Mathias and Slade had a falling out when Paige decided it was a fantastic idea to launch missiles with an unknown destination."** He'd continue grumble, opening a panel he left unlocked and sloting the circuit board within the compartment and fastening it in. **"Some time pass, internal bickering and the divide occurs and one side sells out the other for the chance of starting over..."** He'd exasperate, **"Had I known things would have played out like this, I might have stayed put. But there is no telling who would've survived that nonsense."**

He quite literally just insuintated he was one of those who sold them out way back then... Cole wasn't the only one it would seem.


[4/2/2025 4:16 PM] Narration
Upon closer inspection, the device was taller than it was wide. From a decent distance, one could tell the top and bottom were flat. Around the base of the cylindrical object were fins, stabilizer fins.


[4/2/2025 4:16 PM] Narration
This was the base of a damn rocket...


[4/3/2025 6:48 PM] Cat Bayes
*It took a moment, but Cat was finally able to put two and two together. What the hell was this guy building a fucking __rocket__ for?! Nevermind that, did he just admit to betraying Horizon Grey back in the day as well? Seriously, this guy had the whole nine yards of being a sleazy prick.* 

**"Lemme guess, *you* were one of the sellouts?"** *She asked, folding her arms as she leaned against the wall.* **"If that's the case, then why'd you come back at all? Trying to relive the glory days?"**


[4/3/2025 6:58 PM] Fred Dawson
**"Ha!"** He'd laugh once and only once as he turned towards her, only so that he could get back to his desk, of course. Enroute to his desk, he would go on without looking at her directly.**"If only I was so brazen and stupid to desire going back to *those* days. It is not like I kept it a secret as much as her __own__ father did. Try that one on for a size, why don'tcha."** He sat back down, manipulating a datapad. He began crunching numbers, but continued to converse with the netrunner. **"No, I didn't sell anyone out, Slade did that himself, I merely benefited from the sellout. Vespera needed brilliant minds, engineers to find ways to take on Brillion's military complex which has been far more sophisticated than Vespera's for decades. So, a deal was brokered."**

**"It was a chance for me to get my daugther out of that life... And Danny wanted to raise a proper family of his own with his wack-job wife of his at the time. It just fell together..."** He paused... **"Now, it's just falling apart."**


[4/3/2025 7:05 PM] Cat Bayes
*Cat's expression softened for a moment after hearing about his daughter. So that's what this was about, he was a father looking after his kid. She can respect that. Still... something didn't add up.*

**"...Wait, you said Slade sold out Horizon Grey?"**]


[4/3/2025 7:12 PM] Fred Dawson
**"That __is__ what I said. Slade and Mathias got into it when Paige killed all those people. Mathias demoted him, stripped him of his authority and Vespera waved the promise of wealth in front of his face and he got his closest friends a ticket to freedom. Haha! Regretted that immediately, that he did."** Fred opened software which showed the blueprint of the silo for the missile, writing in some notes with his terrible handwriting.


[4/3/2025 7:14 PM] Fred Dawson
**"The moment I got here, I distance myself from that idiot. Began work on some secret tech for the Legion while Dan and his wife worked on the simple shit."** Scribble scribble...


[4/3/2025 7:29 PM] Cat Bayes
**"Then...is that why he was gunning for Kode? No, that doesn't make sense..."** *Cat muttered under her breath, just audible enough for Fred to hear. Seems the young netrunner was trying to make sense of something in her brain.*

**"Slade, he uh...he didn't approach you after the fallout, did he?"**


[4/3/2025 7:35 PM] Fred Dawson
**"He did, but I ignored that idiot until more recently. He has some resources that I need, so to that end. Mathias and Slade need to make-up and join forces again, or else I would have wasted my time and I __hate__ wasting my time."** He would place the datapad down onto the table. **"It's ugly, but unless everyone want to be glassified or evaporated, everyone needs to get over their differences—Be it temporarily."**


[4/3/2025 7:37 PM] Cat Bayes
**"Is that what the missile's for?"** *Cat nodded to the large project he was working on.* **"Trying to give the Vesperian Legion a taste of their own medicine?"**


[4/3/2025 7:42 PM] Fred Dawson
**"That?"** He would look towards the missile. **"Yeah, I guess you could say that. Slade procured a warhead and an aerial vehicle we'll need to punch through their ultimate defense."** He would do a fist thrusting forward gesture, but subtly to give his words some weight of the impact. **"Without the silo, the warhead is useless. Without the warhead, this is just a tube with some guidance systems onboard but no bite. Finally, we are working with tech that isn't our own. Slade got someone working on getting us the data we need to make it effective against the Steel Titan. We have two-thirds of the puzzle."**


[4/3/2025 7:53 PM] Fred Dawson
**"Anyways. We need medicine. We can't reach Slade, Dan, or Stephanie and I am too busy juggling projects to bother getting Kode off his ass to do somethi—"**


[4/3/2025 7:53 PM] Narration
One of the thick cables attached to the missile would spark. Creating a loud crack and illuminating the room for a fraction of a second.


[4/3/2025 7:53 PM] Fred Dawson
He'd turn towards the source of the commotion and grumble a little. Biting his tongue. **"I'll think of something or someone. Give me a bit of time. In the meantime, go to the generator room and check on my daughter. She should have deactivated that before connecting it to power."** Now, his back was turned towards Cat.


[4/3/2025 8:17 PM] Cat Bayes
**"...Yeah, I'll go and do that."** *It seemed like that's all she was gonna get out of Fred, so she turned and began making her way to the door. Before exiting however, she stopped and faced the man once more.* **"It seems like Slade and you and whoever else is on this batshit crazy scheme of yours knows what their doing - years of veteran experience, if you wanna call it that."**

*She paused, scratching her head before picking it back up.* **"But this seems really similar to what Paige did, except this time it's not gonna be an accident."** *Her hand was on the doorknob now.* **"She hasn't stopped regretting it, y'know. You don't walk away from something like that without demons haunting you for the rest of your life. Not telling you to stop, but if you really are gonna bomb the Vesperian Legion, just...try to avoid the bystanders, yeah?"**


[4/3/2025 8:23 PM] Fred Dawson
He...
.  .  .  .  .
Just ignored her. Getting back to work.

*She said what she wanted to say.*

*Cat exits the room without another word. Off to the generator room with her.*

**"I'm not some damn amateur."** He muttered to himself after he made sure she was gone. Grabbing an impact drill.

The generator room was equally as loud as it was when Cat left it when they first arrived at the abandoned factory. The most notable difference was sprawling mess of cabling that draped across the ground, connecting to the seperate generators and some of which interconnected with one another. The lights were turned off, a complete contrast from the breath of life Cat gave to the place. LED lights flickered about in a chaotic symphony dance. The turbines churning the much needed power to keep the factory lit. Now, Fred's daughter was nowhere to be seen initially. Where the door resides was on one end while the master control was deeper in the room to the right. Perhaps, she would be there?


[4/8/2025 10:15 AM] Cat Bayes
*Well, here was a familiar sight. It wasn't too long ago that she and Paige solved the rather unintuitive generator puzzle that this room presented them, a pang of bittersweet nostalgia forcing Cat's lips to twitch between a smile and a frown. Shaking her head, she set out on looking for her original target when she noticed the door leading to the master control room. Walking on over, she peeked her head in.* **"H'yello? Is there a one daughter of Freddie Dawson in here?"** *She called out, scanning the room for signs of life.*

Grace exasperated, slowly running her digits across her face. The tips brushing against her forehead—pushing aside her bangs that stubbornly refused to follow her hastily put-together half-updo. It were these very bangs that defiantly sprang back into their resting place as Grace's dark emerald eyes took on a more saturated hue from the brightness of the monitor displays.

She was in the middle of optimizing power for their needs. The previous set-up worked for who it provided for. But, with what her father's ambitions required, she needed to do some tinkering—eh, just more carefully since she realized she accidently powered up a cell that was suppose to remain dormant.

Grace had an intense look in her eye, the look of someone who was extremely absorbed in what they set their sights on. Her seasoned fingers returned to the console controls—tapping away at the interfaces and adjusting power quotas. 

That is when she heard an unfamilar voice calling out just above the ambient noise created by the generators. It was this unfamiliarity in the pitch that prompted to young woman to look up from the monitor and peer down the aisle which one would need to take in order to get to the main controls.


[4/8/2025 6:12 PM] Narration
It would not take long for Cat to spot the woman behind the controls. Looking in her direction.

*Locking eyes with the mechanic, she gave her a friendly smile and a wave as she casually approached.* **"Yo, you must be Freddie's kiddo. Name's Cat, friendly neighborhood netrunner round these parts."** *She introduced herself, peering over the girl's shoulder as she drew closer. Looks like the cell she was supposed to have turned off, trouble with the power system? ~~She couldn't relate.~~*


[4/8/2025 9:25 PM] Grace Dawson
**"...Grace..."** Out of courtesy, Grace gave Cat her name. Averting her eyes immediately after the blue-haired girl's introduction. The most natural place for Grace's eyes to glue to was the screen before her. Scooting the chair she was using closer to the console in front of herself—ever so slightly.

She felt awkward, everything *was* awkward. Giving her that *crawling feeling* which always discomforted her. Numbing the senstation was done by continuing to work. The visual layout in which Grace had the power routing was quite more complicated than what Cat had came up with that worked. Instead of three seperate channels working independently, lane 1 and three were funneled to generator eight down to generator two which sat just in front of the console.

This Cat must be here because of her Father's innate ability to *worry* about *everything* she touches or does. With was a literal forced condition for Grace to sigh softly to herself, knowing that something so miniscule was enough for an additional grey hair to spawn upon his head.

`("Now he is sending strangers to come check on me...")` She thought internally, her eyes drifting to the bottom left corner of the console's screen. A bid to further distance herself from Cat without making it obivous. 

**"...I'm... alright..."** Grace started off with, her voice betraying her intention to come off as *normal*. **"...I just accidently overloaded a cell while entering advanced parameters for turbine generator eight. Nothing to be afraid of..."**


[4/8/2025 9:37 PM] Cat Bayes
*Well damn, she wasn't trying to come off as confrontational or anything like that. Honestly, she just needed __somebody__ to talk to that wasn't gonna blow her socks off with some mind fucking levels of lore or...well, someone she had to deliver bad news to.* 

*Right, no, we still got this Cat! Just pivot, you can do that - you're good at that!* **"Well uh - yeaah...Your pops sent me to tell you that he needed the power off for...whatever he's doing in there."** *...Cat, we need to talk about your pivoting skills. Leaning against a wall, she folded her arms as she peeped over at the screen.* **"Huh, that's...pretty good actually, way better than what I came up with it."** *She muttered.*


[4/8/2025 9:51 PM] Grace Dawson
**"Oh, thanks..."** Grace took the pivitoal compliment very well. The reflection her voice giving Cat feedback that Grace was flattered from what she had said. A faint blush rose just beneath the surface of her freckled cheeks.


[4/8/2025 9:51 PM] Grace Dawson឵
Since Cat sounded geninuinely interesting in what Grace had done, she thought it appropriate to give her opinion. **"I've worked with these generators before. They are old, but more reliable than the newer ones they make in prefabrication factories."** She thought that this *Cat* girl would be much more difficult to talk to, but something about her give her the impression that she needed to ease on the *awk* factor. 

She turned her head towards Cat, the first time she had seen the netrunner so close. Despite being tomboyish—she was pretty in her eyes. She blinked once, then twice before coming back to planet earth. **"Er— you said you were a netrunner."** She recalled. **"I have not interacted with a netrunner in some years. It's a pleasure to be able to be acquainted with someone with intrinsic aptitude."** Her matter-of-speech was far more eloquent than the others, including her father. Which could be picked up on by anyone who is truly paying attention to her.

*This girl sounded like a walking encyclopedia, with some of the bigger words she used for her rather...detailed explanation. But something about her passion behind the subject sat right with Cat, she could get behind someone who knew what they were talking about.* **"Yeah, usually the fresh coat of paint ends up losing to ole' reliable."** *She shot a pair of finger guns at Grace, making a 'pew pew' sound with her mouth like she was a cowboy or something.*

*Ah, now it was her turn to get pivoted upon! Bringing a hand up to the back of her head, she waved off her compliment while chuckling bashfully.* **"Ah, y'know...it's not all that special, feels like a girl with your knowhow can bring a lot to the table when shit hits the fan, y'know?"**

Her gaze lowered as she remained quiet for a brief moment of silence. There was truth in Cat's remark. **"It would not be my first time. Despite all efforts to repeat components of history, here I am now. Being subjected to reprise part of it."**

Her gaze returned to the console to conclude some reconfigurations, but she was confident in doing so with her concentration partitioned. **"What enticed you to work with Paige and Mathias?"** It was a simple question, but something else entrenched itself within the message.

[4/10/2025 10:29 AM] Cat Bayes
*Grace's question made Cat go silent for a brief moment. It didn't bring her any conflict, really, more like it'd been so long ago that the reason she joined kinda became...obsolete, if that makes any sense. She remembers hugging Paige when she first arrived at the old HQ, her training with Mathias, and the recent conversation she just had with Kode...*

**"Well..."** *She started, trying to piece together the words in her head.* **"...Paige kinda saved my ass when the CCR came knocking on my door - for something that was totally my fault, by the way."** *Cat explained, trying her best not to turn it into some kind of sob story.* **"From there it went and, well...yeah, I guess it became my life?"**


[4/10/2025 7:38 PM] Grace Dawson
Grace's head tilted subtly. Listening to Cat's summary of how she came to be a member of the team. 

`("Paige, saved her... I suppose that is reason enough to be around. Some sense of being indebted to her, maybe...")` Grace thought internally as her gaze shifted back to the blue-color illuminating console.

**"...I think I understand."** Grace went on to say, confirming the parameters she had been tinkering with for the last hour. **"...It would not be fitting for me to give a welcome to a team I have long disassociated from. For all that it's worth, I hope we all see an optimistic result in the coming days."** Grace then pushed slowly away from the terminal and stood up. Her hands planted squarely on the cool aluminum surface that made up the framing of the console.

**"From what I have been privileged to know, we are in challenging circumstances. If you need my help... I will try to be of usefulness."** Casting a partial sidelong glance towards Cat with a small grin playing off of her lips.


[4/10/2025 8:07 PM] Grace Dawson឵
Her legs began to wobble and her face immediately began to contort in profound discomfort. Without missing a beat, Grace sat back down. Her weight collasping onto the chair that absorbed her descent gracefully. Taking a moment to recompose herself. **"...S-sorry."** She apologized without a moment of delay.

**"Could you... bring me my wheelchair?"** She asked, gesturing towards the wheelchair that hid behind Cat. The darkness was clever in hiding it, only betrayed by the glint and reflection of the ambient light that resided in the room.


[4/10/2025 8:37 PM] Cat Bayes
*Cat's lips dipped into a frown as she noticed Grace's face twisting in discomfort. It's only when her knees buckled did she instinctively lunge forward to catch her, only backing away when the chair did her job for her.* **"W-Woah! Hey now..."**

*Looking over toward the corner, she finally noticed the wheelchair hidden in the shadow - her only clue being the glint of metal in the dim lighting of the makeshift workshop.* **"Yeah, yesh I can get that for ya. Hold tight a sec."** *Making her way over, she reached to grab the handles before carefully pulling it out, bringing it over to her.* **"Need help getting in?"**


[4/10/2025 8:44 PM] Grace Dawson
**"I can stand long enough to get in it.... Thank you."** She reassures Cat—albiet embarassed. With one hand on the armrest of the wheelchair and the other at the console. She used her upper body strength to transfer over and eased herself into the wheelchair with a soft exasperation. 

`("I can't believe I did that in front of her.")` She'd look down upon herself in disgust, internally. 

With herself situated in the wheelchair, she glanced up towards Cat. **"I'm sorry for making you worry... Still getting used to this."**

{Reactions}
😭

[4/10/2025 8:47 PM] Cat Bayes
*Backing away, Cat gave her the space she needed to climb into the wheelchair. She could tell the girl was angry with herself, that feeling of uselessness that comes with a disability like this. It takes time to adjust to life altering changes like this, and not everyone is cut out for it - whether it was wanted or not.*

*For a moment, she remains quiet before shaking her head.* **"Don't be sorry, not like you asked for this, yeah?"** *Cat waved her off with a warm smile.* **"We've all got things we can't control, just gotta make the best with the hand life deals us."**


[4/10/2025 9:02 PM] Grace Dawson
-# *("...things we can't control, just gotta make the best with the hand life deals us.")*

Grace's face flinched subtly. The crinkling of her nose and the furrowing of her brow appeared almost as quickly as they disappeared. It was as if a memory had surfaced, and she immediately set to work suppressing it, muttering a single word under her breath.

-# **"...yeah."**

Blinking away symptoms of displeasure, Grace pivoted the conversation away from this. **"What do they have you doing? I can't presume anyone would keep a netrunner inactive... particularly now—especially now."**


[4/10/2025 9:09 PM] Cat Bayes
**"Ah, well..."** *Shit, seems like her attempt to cheer her up kinda backfired there. It was clear to her the mechanic was going through it, and she didn't wanna pry any further...so, taking her losses, she decided to run with the pivot.* **"I'm gonna be heading on over to Fairview, got some errands I need to run over there before we can move out of the HQ. With any luck, maybe find some medication to help you and...Paige."** *A part of her cringed a bit, an image of when she first saw her friend's injuries flashing in her mind.*

*Ignore it, Cat. You're doing this for __her__ - for all of Horizon Grey. You can't afford to get distracted when it's time for the mission.* **"I guess you could say we're in a pretty tight spot, assuming Freddie told you everything."** *She folded her arms, leaning her butt against a table.* **"This is the part where 'shit hits the fan', so to speak...so, uh...on behalf of the rest of the gang, I appreciate you helping out."**


[4/10/2025 9:20 PM] Grace Dawson
**"You're very empathetic."** Grace concludes out loud. Her eyes sank to where her focal point was Cat's abdomen. **"But, I cannot accept your thanks in this context... It is not like I did anything to benefit anyone but myself."** 

Then, they climbed towards Cat's eyes. **"But—I won't take up your time any longer. Stay safe out there... I am sure we will have more time to converse soon."**


[4/10/2025 9:26 PM] Cat Bayes
**"Yourself, someone else, not like it matters. We're all trying to do what it takes to survive on these streets."** *Pushing herself off the table, she made her way to the door and placed a hand on the frame, hanging off it for a moment.* **"Don't beat yourself up too badly, or I'm gonna come in here and give you a stern heart to heart, young lady!"**

*Eck, was that weird? That sounded weird. Cat was left contemplating that for a few seconds, silently mouthing an exaggerated "What?" before shaking her head.* **"Eh...Forget I said that, you take care now!"**


[4/10/2025 9:29 PM] Grace Dawson
Her brows knitted together. Staring at the door Cat just left out of. **"..."**


[4/10/2025 9:29 PM] Grace Dawson
*blink...*


[4/10/2025 9:46 PM] Cat Bayes
*Alright, that was that covered...to a __varying__ level of success. Still cringing from that last bit, she sharply exhaled through her nose as she made her way down the hallway.*

-# Fucken dumbass...

*Well, all that was left to handle was Dylan's choice. Once again, she made her way down the hall - the imprint of her shoe more than likely leaving a permanent mark in the dust by this point - before she reached the room their hostage was kept in. Gently, she rapped her knuckle against the door before calling out.* **"Dylan? It's me again, mind if I come in?"**


[4/10/2025 9:55 PM] Narration
It was a brief moment, five seconds—give or take before Dylan replied. **"You're alright to come in."** Cat could hear through the door.


[4/10/2025 11:07 PM] Cat Bayes
*Hearing that confirmation, she placed a hand on the handle and gave it a firm twist, walking into the room.* **"Hey, sorry for the wait...you holding up alright?"**


[4/10/2025 11:19 PM] Dylan Hackett
Dylan was now sitting on the cot that was her bed. Her arms in her lap as she regarded Cat. **"...I...yeah. I gave it some thought."**  She started off with. Her left hand slid off her lap and moved to grab the tablet from beside herself. **"I would prefer that you do not contact them directly... If anyone was to find out you reached out to them. They would be in serious trouble."** 

Her delicate fingers gripped the frame of the tablet and lifted it, holding it out towards Cat. **"There is only one person I trust to relay my message to them. I've provided the information on this tablet..."** The screen was off when she offered it to Cat.


[4/10/2025 11:33 PM] Cat Bayes
*Huh? Isn't that the tablet they left with her for entertainment? It shouldn't have anything on it besides the aforementioned function. Did she do something to it?* **"..."** *Cat eyed the the tablet with a hint of suspicion for a moment, before reaching out and taking it into her grasp.* 

*She examined the flat screen in her hands for a moment, before activating her cyberdeck, running a quick scan on it.*


[4/10/2025 11:37 PM] Narration
There was nothing malicious that could have been made from a quick scan. The screen turned on, and within the same frame that it did, Cat's cyberdeck gave her information that it was jailbroken. The screen turned on and displayed an unlocked suite of tools she could have used to reach anyone outside.

Dylan had snitched on herself.


[4/10/2025 11:37 PM] Dylan Hackett
**"Please take it away from me before I end up doing something stupid..."** Her eyes were down to Cat's feet. It seems as if Cat's words earlier had swayed her not break out on her own accord.


[4/10/2025 11:43 PM] Cat Bayes
**"..."** *She closed her eyes for a moment - and subsequently her cyberdeck. Taking a deep breath, she silently whispered a 'Thank You' to the younger netrunner before bringing it close to her side.* **"I'm gonna have to check what's on it before I deliver it...you probably already know that."** *She informed her, grip tightening ever so slightly on the glass of the tablet.* **"But I *will* make sure it gets to your family. With any luck, we'll get you and your family out safe and sound."**


[4/10/2025 11:44 PM] Dylan Hackett
**"Okay..."** Is all that Dylan mustered. She closed her eyes and hung her head low. It was a big decision that Dylan had just made. Hopefully, she would not come to regret it.


[4/18/2025 11:50 AM] Cat Bayes
**"Hey..."** *The netrunner spoke up as she stashed the tablet in her hoodie, giving Dylan an awkward look.* **"For what it's worth, on behalf of the rest of the dummies here -"**

*She turned toward the door, keeping her eyes on their prisoner.* **"I'm uh...I'm sorry we did this to you. You seem like a good kid."** *She dipped her eyes to the floor for a moment or two.* **"Try to live a normal life, when we get you outta here, kay?"**


[4/18/2025 11:49 PM] Dylan Hackett
**"One can only hope…"** Dylan turned away from Cat, she needed time to fully sort through her thoughts and feelings about the situation.


[4/19/2025 12:06 AM] Cat Bayes
*Stepping out of the room, Cat took a deep breath as she leaned her back against the wall beside the door. It felt like the last couple of hours have been nothing but an emotional roller coaster for her, and the night wasn't even close to being finished.*

*Her eyes blinked a familiar neon orange - a message being sent to a one Cole Mercer:* `"I'm heading over to the garage, meet you there?"`

*Feeling the weight of the tablet in her hoodie pocket, she bumped herself off the wall and began making her way down the hall.*


[4/19/2025 12:14 AM] Cole Mercer
*Cole sat on the edge of the bed in his room, hunched forward with his forearms resting on his knees. The duffle bag sat by his feet, still zipped. His eyes were locked on the floor, but they didn’t really see it, just static thought.*

*The soft buzz of a notification pulled him from the silence. A faint orange glow blinked at the edge of his vision. He checked the message, and read it without expression. He stared at it for a moment longer than necessary.*

*No reply was sent.*


[4/19/2025 4:43 PM] Cat Bayes
*Well, he wasn't all that talkative on a good day anyways. Shrugging, she continued to make her way over to the garage, assuming she'd just wait for him to arrive there if he wasn't already.*


[4/19/2025 5:33 PM] Cole Mercer
*Cole was already there.*

*Leaning against the passenger side of one of the ION Enforcer vehicles, arms crossed and his duffle bag at his feet, he stood in silence. His gaze was distant, somewhere else entirely, but the moment she stepped in, it snapped to her.*

*He didn’t say a word. Just a slow, silent nod of acknowledgment. So, he did show up... earlier than her, even.*


[4/22/2025 2:19 PM] Cat Bayes
*Seeing Cole there before Cat was a pleasant surprise; to say the least - something she probably wouldn't have thought of a couple days ago. Feeling the weight of the tasks that lie ahead on her shoulders, she wasn't necessarily in the mood for any quippy banter; merely offering a nod back to him.*

**"Well...ready to head out?"** *She asked, approaching the ION Enforcer he was leaned against.*


[4/22/2025 2:20 PM] Cole Mercer
*Cole gave a small nod, pushing off the side of the vehicle with ease. He picked up his duffle bag, opened the driver's side door, and looked at her, his expression firm.*

**"I drive."** *he said, with quiet finality, no room for discussion in his tone.*


[4/22/2025 3:09 PM] Cat Bayes
**"I'll-"** *It looked like Cat was about to suggest driving, but the abruptness of Cole's statement had shut her up almost immediately. Shrugging her shoulders, she decided against arguing and just made her way over to the passenger seat. She could use the rest anyways.*

*Wait, was something wrong with her driving?*


[4/22/2025 3:15 PM] Cole Mercer
*Cole opened the driver’s side door with a smooth motion. He slid into the seat without a word, placing the duffle bag in the back. His gloved hand hovered briefly over the biometric ignition pad, index finger pressing against it. A soft chime confirmed the scan, and the engine purred to life. The dashboard lit up in a cool blue hue, faintly illuminating his face. He adjusted the rearview mirror once, then rested both hands on the wheel. Ready.*


[4/24/2025 1:59 PM] Cat Bayes
*Oooh, fancy! Cat had been in this vehicle before, but she was so focused on driving that she didn't really get a chance to look at all the flashy lights and doodads. Like an actual feline, she was looking around the interior of the vehicle and running her hands across the leathery dashboard.*

**"Huh, that's CCR budget for yah..."** *She muttered under her breath. Looking over at the center console, it was taking every ounce of restraint for her not to dig through it's digital content for dirty secrets.*


[4/24/2025 2:05 PM] Cole Mercer
*He kept his eyes forward, unmoved by her commentary or the way her hands roamed the dashboard like a curious cat. Without a word, he reached over his shoulder, pulled the seatbelt across his chest, and clicked it into place. Then he waited, calm, still, for Cat to get ready, eyes fixed ahead.*


[4/24/2025 2:11 PM] Cat Bayes
*She was only distracted a few moments more before she heard the telltale sound of the seatbelt clicking from the driver seat, her attention snapping focus towards Cole - obviously waiting on her.* **"Oop-"**

*Without a second wasted more, she followed his action by reaching over and clicking her own seatbelt in place, giving a nod to him.*


[4/24/2025 2:17 PM] Cole Mercer
*Cole gave a slight nod in return, barely perceptible, and shifted the vehicle into gear. With a smooth press of the pedal, the car eased forward without hesitation, gliding out of the garage into the dim light beyond. The heavy door remained open behind them, but someone else would see to closing it after their departure.*

*The mission had begun.*
