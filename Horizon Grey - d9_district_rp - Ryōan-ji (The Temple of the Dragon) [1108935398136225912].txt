It was a melancholy occasion in Ry≈çan-ji. One of the greatest gifts; brothers of the Clan has be laid to rest after all his years of service to the family. The air was heavy with emotion as the clan members mourned their loss. But amidst their grief, they also found comfort in the knowledge that he had given his life in service of the clan. A true honor and legacy that would never be forgotten.

Zend≈ç stood before the mantle. On it displayed a picture of Yoshitaka Takeuchi. A veteran R≈çjin Ryuu and a close friend to Sono Ryuu, Saionji Kinryu. His accomplishments were many and diverse. He was a fierce dragon, a wise leader, and a loyal friend. He was a fierce protector of the clan and its traditions while embracing revolutionary ideals and philosophies that helped transform the clan. One of the finest.

Respect had already been paid by everyone who could. Leaving Zend≈ç to spend some time with who he regarded as his father. The silence was the only thing present aside from the gentle flicker of the candles.

[5/21/2023 1:08 AM] Zend≈ç
*Silence*

Zend≈çs eyes are locked into place on the picture before him. His mind wracked with flooding instances of selflessness, love, discipline and wisdom from the once shared memories between him and his father. His mind can't seem to slow but his body remains still and unflinching. Though he fights, his pain weeps from his eyes. Each tear streaking down his cheeks before inevitably falling to his robes or crashing at his feet. He's pulled to speak to the picture frame but as fast as each word forms in his throat, they also dissipate. A moment this happens before Zend≈çs head falls to his chest with an audible sigh. He wipes his face and gathers his self before the mantle. 

"*I'll see you soon, Oto-san.*" he whispers placing a hand before the picture.


[5/21/2023 1:27 AM] Narration
As Zend≈ç's hand pressed against the picture. The quiet clicking of the doors behind him reverberated within the room. A sliver of light filters down the center of the room from the doors. The silhouette of a person overshadowing Zend≈ç's own up against the wall in front of him. 

The doors were open partially, but only for a moment before closing. The natural light of the candles illuminates the familiar yellow and orange paint across the accented walls.


[5/21/2023 9:02 AM] Zend≈ç
Zend≈ç remains still. Peering at the picture earnestly, until catching the reflection of whoever entered behind him.


[5/21/2023 10:28 AM] Narration
The individual in the room with Zend≈ç could be heard pushing further into the room. Their gentle steps resonating off to his left as they moved around the draped table that resided behind Zend≈ç. Then, they came to a stop. One could infer that they did not want to interrupt but also offer their support.


[5/21/2023 10:35 AM] Zend≈ç
He replaces the picture to its place on the mantle. Taking a few steps back he aligns himself with the picture of the weathered man. Taking a moment to settle before bowing before the passed Dragon and turning to meet who entered.


[5/21/2023 11:47 AM] Yuzuki
Yuzuki entered the room. Dressed in her black and gold accented kimono. Her fingers interlaced and danced around one another, not really being sure where to put her hands. Her brown eyes briefly focused on Zend≈ç's before sweeping down. This was their most significant loss in a long time. Even for someone so experienced, many of those with whom she was affiliated had never died.


[5/21/2023 7:39 PM] Zend≈ç
*"It doesn't feel real, Yuzuki. It's like he's here just...away. As if he will be here when I need him, as he always was."* Zendo speaks softly, turning back to glance at the picture once again.


[5/22/2023 8:16 PM] Yuzuki
**"For those of us who seen the impermanence of life up close. It is hard to imagine him not being here..."** She stepped forward, pressing resting her hands and head against his back. 
"**His spirit remains... With us, with you... The lessons he has taught, the memories you've shared. His legacy continues with you... That is how he stays."**


[5/22/2023 11:13 PM] Zend≈ç
Zend≈ç almost seems to wince as she touches his back. The tension lasts a second before relaxing again, the truth of the words piercing Zend≈çs thoughts. He spins slowly towards her grabbing her at the wrist softly and placing his forehead against hers, bearing each others weight. 

*‚ÄùYou always know exactly what to say. It‚Äôs probably the reason he liked having you around so much. As do I.‚Äù*


[5/23/2023 8:18 PM] Yuzuki
She would lower her eyes with a small smile creeping on her face. She enjoyed this. But as soon as the mood was set, it would be interrupted. Her eyes would glow, she was receiving a call. **"..mmn."** With a soft sigh, she stepped away from his embrace and pardon herself as she began walking away from the mantle. **"Father? --- Yes, I am. --- I will be there shortly."** 

The brief conversation ended relatively quickly and her eyes dimmed. **"I am being summoned..."** Returning to Zend≈ç, **"There is a meeting I must attend. This has to be it. I should have returned to the Ry≈çan-ji before midnight."**


[5/23/2023 10:35 PM] Zend≈ç
*‚ÄùIt seems that any moment we get together is pulled from us just as spontaneously as they appear,‚Äù* The tone in Zend≈çs voice makes it obvious that he‚Äôs aggravated with the interruption.

*‚ÄúNevertheless, I don‚Äôt want to hold you back. I am **always** a call away.‚Äù* 

With this he will pull Yuzuki in close again, kissing her forehead softly, waiting for her to take her leave.


[5/23/2023 10:41 PM] Yuzuki
She would gently depart, **"As am I... Before I came in Toma expressed his wishes of speaking with you. He's in the penthouse lounge."**


[5/23/2023 10:45 PM] Zend≈ç
*‚ÄúIn trouble again am I?‚Äù* Zend≈ç says with a sly smile, tossing a quick wink towards Yuzuki.


[5/23/2023 11:22 PM] Yuzuki
Before she vanished from view, she would roll her eyes at Zend≈ç remark. **"Just make sure you see him."**


[5/25/2023 7:48 AM] Zend≈ç
Taking a few moments to himself after Yuzuki leaves, he inhales deeply‚Ä¶.then exhales slowly. He begins his way towards the penthouse lounge.


[5/29/2023 6:27 PM] Narration
As Zend≈ç made his entrance into the penthouse lounge, the transparent glass doors smoothly slid open to welcome him. The spacious and elegantly designed room boasted a smoky-grey sofa, on which Toma was perched, extinguishing his cigar in the designated cash tray. Jin, on the other hand, was propped against the back of the same sofa, his eyes fixed on Zend≈ç as he made his way in, sporting a pair of stylish sunglasses. Meanwhile, Hayate stood by the window, situated at the far end of the lounge, intently surveying the district as he ran his fingers down his jawline in contemplation.

[5/31/2023 6:07 PM] Zend≈ç
Zend≈ç enters the room with an attitude of confidence but shy of arrogance. Knowing the respect the people of the room expect, he locks eyes with Jin, nods in his direction and just before reaching the sofa, halts before bowing, awaiting his release.


[6/3/2023 7:30 PM] Jin
Jin shifted, one arm taking all of his weight while the other arm rose and patting Toma on the shoulder. **"Hey,"**


[6/3/2023 7:30 PM] Toma
He was not aware of Zend≈ç at first. It took Jin's nudge to bring him to observe his immediate surroundings. Once his eyes fell upon Zend≈ç, he would acknowledge the *dragon* with a slight bow of his own, a gesture of acknowledgement. **"You have my condolence, Zend≈ç."** He said. The Elder Dragon would wipe his hands of any residue from his cigar with a handkerchief, **"It is already bad enough that one of our own has bid us fairwell. Now, we got competition trying to make a serious move against one of our markets in Neon Kyrie."**


[6/11/2023 5:40 PM] Zend≈ç
Standing erect, 
"Punctual as always." he responds sarcastically. "What would you have of me Toma?" Zend≈çs gaze tightens, awaiting his orders.


[6/11/2023 9:24 PM] Toma
**"Cyba Jackals, those insolent dogs, are once again gnawing at our prosperity. They dare to disrupt our yoru no kurabu, no doubt frightening our esteemed guests to promote their own pitiful establishments. Lady Yuzuki has already been entrusted with the diplomatic matters. I require you, Zend≈ç, and Hayate to lead our Wakai Ryuu to their most profitable den, Square Zero. Deliver them a __message__ they __cannot__ misinterpret."**


[6/11/2023 9:45 PM] Zend≈ç
Zend≈ç nods. "It will be done."


[6/17/2023 1:37 AM] Hayate
At this point, Hayate looked to the side with his head tilted. He was interested in the breakdown of the tasks set before him and Zend≈ç. His eyes were fixed on the ground below him, just beyond the shoulder line. From there, Hayate would turn to face the rest of the room, taking a confident step forward. His strides would take him past the others, including Zend≈ç. He was not entertaining the thought of looking him in the eyes to acknowledge him.


[6/17/2023 1:42 AM] Narration
Enmity has consistently been a case between the two, deriving from his ethnicity and other underlying factors. Despite the Kinryu Clan's culture of family, even the most intimate families are prone to malignancy. Despite Yoshitaka Takeuchi's pedagogy, some did not conform to his sentiments. Furthermore, it was hard to gauge each member's beliefs as closeness exceeding professional environments was infrequent; This was Biz at the end of the day.


[6/17/2023 12:08 PM] Zend≈ç
Zend≈ç gives a last bow towards Toma before turning and following Hayate as he passed him. Ignoring the blatant disrespect, this was no place for foolishness, at least to Zend≈ç.


[6/17/2023 12:11 PM] Zend≈ç
Zend≈ç would not speak until he and Hayate were alone. 

‚ÄúRegardless of our preconceived emotions, we have a job to do. What is your plan? You always have one.‚Äù


[6/17/2023 3:17 PM] Hayate
After a brief silence, Hayate's face cracked a sly smile. The kind that didn't reach his eyes, which were sharp and calculating. He then began to speak, his voice low, a steady murmur.

**"I do,"** He agreed, **"And it's straightforward. Square Zero is a fortress; they would expect us to come crashing through the front. A frontal assault? Too expected. No, we'll need to fracture their defenses and turn them against each other. Frankly, they're arrogant. Arrogant, but they're not stupid. They wouldn't bite unless they had some plan in place. We feed them false intel and make them believe there's a traitor in their midst, sowing distrust and paranoia. When they're busy questioning each other, we strike."**


[6/17/2023 3:17 PM] Narration
The two individuals boarded the elevator and positioned themselves beside one another.


[6/17/2023 3:17 PM] Hayate
Hayate turned towards the back of the elevator, providing an extravagant view of Neon Kyrie's area as they descended. **"We need to gather information on Square Zero swiftly; Regular clientele, patrol schedules, security, layout, everything. Then, we find our scapegoat. Someone we can pin with something believable. Create infighting and send the patrons seeking a place where they will not have to deal with such petty infighting, our yoru no kurabu."**


[6/17/2023 3:20 PM] Hayate
**"We'll strike by provoking violence indirectly. We do not want to be witnessed by our future clients. Bad for business, and Toma would be disgruntled. Let them squeeze the trigger and take each other out."**


[6/21/2023 4:11 PM] Zend≈ç
‚ÄúAs it may pain me to say, I couldn‚Äôt agree more. We need to be discreet and seemingly unattached. Do you have any leads yet?‚Äù


[6/22/2023 9:31 PM] Hayate
As the elevator doors slid open, Hayate pivoted towards the newfound space, gracefully exiting into the corridor beyond. **"I have a lead, but it depends on whether Adam is present. He has a history with the Jackals and not a good one. They've been itching for a reason to get back at him from the intel I have been gathering on the group. Problems are, 'is he there?' and 'where is he in Square Zero?' We resolve those two questions and the rest is easy. On the contrary to what Toma wants, we won't be taking any of our little brothers along for the ride. Too many feet creates for a lot of noise."**


[6/23/2023 8:45 PM] Zend≈ç
‚ÄúDefinitely. Lets strike quickly and decisively. The longer we take the more eyes we attract. I‚Äôll follow your lead Hayate. Just tell me when and where and I‚Äôll be there.‚Äù 
 
After the passing of his Father, Zend≈çs mind is distracted to the say the least, regardless if he‚Äôd like to admit it. His mind is not in a place to lead.
