[5/16/2023 9:22 PM] Narration
Kaedues arrived to his destination in record time! The address was to a warehouse. Would you have guessed it? Upon arrival to the entrance with his van, the chain and motor driven gate would sputter to life, grinding and sheering against itself as it slowly opened. 

Within the shipping yard there were a few working hands moving to and from the shipping container trailer of one of the prehistoric trucks they used to haul goods around.


[5/16/2023 9:28 PM] Kaedues Staub
*Kaedues drives through the open gate slowly and parks in an empty parking space. He takes his flash drive out of the car and puts it in his armrest compartment, allowing the silence to fill the air.*

*Now he makes pace and briskly walks over to the shipping yard. He looks up at the sky and around the lot as he approaches the site..... The Caliber Man has arrived.*
*Kaedues' initial scan of the area is meant to find anything that might be suspicious...*


[5/16/2023 9:49 PM] Narration
Nothing seemed to be out of place, anyone who was around was working on something. That was only a few moments after his initial scan where a side door to the warehouse would swing open, slamming against the wall that held the frame. His body barely fitting through it. (He mastered the gut suck technique.)


[5/16/2023 9:49 PM] Gavyn
**"Roberto, the fuck you put the god damn micros for the delivery guy?!"** He'd shout angerly at the guys loading the truck. They all looking up and at each other.. Seems that Roberto wasn't there?

Once he realized that Roberto also pulled the no call no show card on him. He'd bring his arms as close as he could to the sides of his head and would take his hat and throw it on the ground. 

**"Fucking bitch, man."**


[5/16/2023 9:54 PM] Kaedues Staub
*Kaedues steadily approaches this... Tank, so to speak. If he were to be optimistic, lifting a bunch of stuff isn't really all that bad. They could have been asking him to scrub melty cheese off the floor..*

**"You called for me?"**


[5/16/2023 9:58 PM] Gavyn
Unable to really turn his head much. Gavyn would wobble back and fourth as he rotated to take a look at who was speaking to him. Pointing while not utilizing his upper arm to raise his forearm. **"You're that Caliber guy?"**

[5/16/2023 10:07 PM] Kaedues Staub
**"You've got that right. I'm him."** *Kaedues furrows his brow. He takes a breath in and tilts his head back and to the side slightly.* **"I'm here to move cheese?"** *He asks as is if he doesn't really believe it.*


[5/17/2023 12:09 AM] Gavyn
He would walk towards the trailer, expecting Kaedues to follow. **"Yeah. I run the warehouse here. In my case, because some of the artists from District 11 lost their original vendors in D9 I have to take over. Can you believe those assholes?"**

[5/17/2023 12:23 AM] Kaedues Staub
*Kaedues follows suit with haste. He takes a breath in to appreciate the familiar smell of the air.* **"To me, this thing happens with work. I have coworkers that work early and coworkers that arrive late."** *Kaedues exhales smoothly before continuing. He puts his hands in his pockets and looks up at the clouds in the sky.*

**"Who gave you my number?"** *He asks now, admittedly curious.*


[5/17/2023 12:32 AM] Gavyn
He'd grunt, his gaze looking up at the corners of his eyeballs. Trying to think.
**"To be honest buddy, I don't even remember his name. Has a real punch-able face, used to work with the guy. He looks like someone who tries to dress like he's about to IPO his startup, but instead looks like he's running a failing online store out of his mom's basement? He's got that unique "just-got-out-of-bed-and-ran-through-a-thrift-store" look. The kind of guy who thinks his hair color makes him a golden boy, but really just reminds everyone of piss. Uhh, he's less Silicon Terrace retiree and more Silicon please retire that look."**


[5/17/2023 12:35 AM] Kaedues Staub
*Kaedues furrows his brow. How rude of him to talk about someone like... wait.... he's talking about Terrance, isn't he?*
*Kaedues snickers __briefly__ before busting out in a loud belly laugh!*

**"Kgkk--- KYAAAHAHAHA!!"** *Kaedues smiles.* **"You can pay me ‚Ç•R13 an hour as long as you keep it rolling."** *He sighs gleefully as they approach the trucks and he has to get ready to actually work.*


[5/17/2023 12:42 AM] Gavyn
Gavyn chuckled, **"But I'm serious, I don't know the guy's name. I tend to forget assholes."**


[5/17/2023 12:43 AM] Kaedues Staub
**"He's Terrence. Sometimes I like to call him James Sr. You wouldn't get that one, though."** *He looks off to the side for a moment to hide his smile.*


[5/17/2023 12:49 AM] Gavyn
**"Oh that was his name.. You know him?"** He looked over towards Kaedues as he waddled.


[5/17/2023 12:49 AM] Gavyn
**"Well duh, you would know him. He's the one that referred me to you."**


[5/17/2023 12:53 AM] Kaedues Staub
**"I work for him.."** *Kaedues pauses a while.* **"He's not much of a boss, let's put it like that. The three other employees do all of the real work."** *Kaedues looks back at Gavyn earnestly, like he's confiding in the guy. Since he already knows about Terrence he really doesn't mind parting with his opinions on his boss.*


[5/17/2023 12:57 AM] Gavyn
**"All too familiar buddy. Hey but now you won't have to deal with him right? The crew here is cool, running three shifts and no weekends.... generally. We are just a shipping and packaging company that picks up odd jobs from all over."**

[5/17/2023 12:59 AM] Kaedues Staub
*Now stopping in his tracks, his earnest look at Gavyn becomes a curious one.* **"Come again?"** *He asks simply.*


[5/17/2023 1:00 AM] Gavyn
He came to a stop, turning slowly to view Kaedues. He was equally as confused as Kaedues. **"He said you'd be more than willing to work for my company."**


[5/17/2023 1:10 AM] Kaedues Staub
**"....."**

*Kaedues looks intently at Gavyn, slowly going through a sequence of events in his head that must have led to this moment. He's being pawned off, and for an insurmountably lower price. Gavyn might notice that the longer Kaedues thinks the tenser he looks.*

**"I need to go back. No... I need to find him."** *He says to Gavyn.* **"You aren't in the loop and neither am I."**
*Continuing,* **"I never agreed to any such deal. You seem cool and all but I have things I can't walk away from over there. I have to find him."**

**I have to find him.**
***__I have to find him.__***

[5/17/2023 1:13 AM] Kaedues Staub
*Kaedues collapses to his knees in this moment, clutching his left shoulder desperately.* **"SHIT!"** *Kaedues exclaims, losing composure for a hot moment. He grits his teeth and squeezes his eyes shut. In his struggle he does manage to pull himself up into a kneeling position at least, but it's clear something is wrong. Maybe some sort of cardiac arrest or chronic arm pain?*


[5/17/2023 1:14 AM] Gavyn
**"Hey bud, you alright?!"** He would stand over Kaedues, genuinely concerned.


[5/17/2023 1:23 AM] Kaedues Staub
*Kaedues takes a deep breath and stretches his left arm around to ground himself in reality. His face seems to loosen up a little bit signifying that he feels better slightly. He takes a breath, still hot on the spotlight.*

*Kaedues reminds himself he is no stranger to thinking under times of stress. He slowly stands up....* **"Yeah. I'm okay now."** *He nods to himself, somewhat amping himself up.* **"I need you to do something for me."**
*Kaedues' expression turns a little sharper now....*


[5/17/2023 1:27 AM] Gavyn
**"...What's that?"** He tilted his head to the side slightly quizzically.


[5/17/2023 1:33 AM] Kaedues Staub
**"......"** *Kaedues takes a deep breath in. He is considering his options and the repercussions of those options.* **"If you don't want to pay me ‚Ç•R26 an hour, I'm gonna need...."** *His address? No. Would be cathartic to give him a scare but it wouldn't do anything.*
*...He already has Terrence's work cell, but that won't work.* **"Do you know a locksmith?"**


[5/17/2023 1:34 AM] Gavyn
**"Well....I do know a guy in the shadier side of business."**


[5/17/2023 1:46 AM] Kaedues Staub
**".........."** *He's regulating his breathing now, coming down from his sudden panic attack.* **"I'd really rather work for him, since he pays more.... but I'll make you a nice deal. I will work for you, and for a grand negotiable price."**

*Kaedues dusts himself off before confidently looking Gavyn in the face.* **"If you know anyone who will give me chores or jobs to do-- paid ones -- I'll make things very easy for you."**

*The Caliber Man visibly thinks for a moment.* **"Start at ‚Ç•R26. If you can give me another employer, I'll work for ‚Ç•R20. Another and I'll work for ‚Ç•R14. Another and I'll work for ‚Ç•R8. Throw in this locksmith and I'll work today for free."**


[5/17/2023 1:53 AM] Gavyn
**"That's a great idea and all buddy, but you sure this is what you want to do?"** He was a bit unsure himself. Sure he could use the additional manpower, but...


[5/17/2023 1:54 AM] Kaedues Staub
**"Unfortunately I don't have much of a choice. What would you do if your boss pawned you off to the nearest bidder?"** *He says with a sympathetic shrug of the arms.*


[5/17/2023 1:57 AM] Gavyn
**"I would get revenge on him. But lets stop and hold up for a moment. Terrence, yeah he was an asshole and liked to take the path of least resistence. Well, still does I would imagine‚Äî but I don't remember him being a sell-out. Especially if you made his job easier. He's dumb, but... not when it comes to making easy money."**


[5/17/2023 1:58 AM] Kaedues Staub
**"So you're saying he's being influenced by something or someone else...."** *Kaedues furrows his brow again.* **"Is that it?"**


[5/17/2023 1:59 AM] Gavyn
**"Would you say you made his life easier?"** He interjected the question.


[5/17/2023 2:00 AM] Kaedues Staub
**"Yes. I have never turned down a job he set me up to. Even the ones that made no sense. I have a compliable work ethic."**


[5/17/2023 2:02 AM] Gavyn
**"Doesn't sound like Terrence would get rid of you then. I knew the guy for too long."**


[5/17/2023 2:03 AM] Gavyn
**"It sounds like foul play to me buddy. Someone wants you gone."**


[5/19/2023 4:45 PM] Kaedues Staub
**"..Someone wants me gone? I don't understand."** *Kaedues shifts his weight to one side, then places his thumb and index finger on his temples as if he is experiencing a headache.* **"I'm not surprised, just.... confused. I do honest work in a generally cold business."** *Kaedues closes his eyes......* **"I haven't dealt with a situation like this before."** *Kaedues looks up at Gavyn curiously...*


[5/19/2023 4:45 PM] Kaedues Staub
*Kaedues takes a breath in and begins to pace back and forth in front of Gavyn. Clearly, the crimson haired gopher is trying to get to the bottom of this predicament he is in.*


[5/19/2023 5:16 PM] Gavyn
He would shrug, **"Sometimes honest work makes people jealous. They see you do good and can't stand anyone else benefitting."**


[5/19/2023 6:46 PM] Kaedues Staub
**"He's a man of many vices, but jealousy isn't one of them. He does less than me and makes more. I see what you mean but I just don't see my boss working like that."** *He sighs.* **"Either way... I'll help you with the work I was asked to do. If you don't mind I'd like to talk to you again about this after we are done."** *Kaedues takes a gander over to the where the trucks are being unloaded.*


[5/19/2023 6:49 PM] Gavyn
Well, he was not going to deny help. He would gesture with both his hands towards the trucks. **"Yeah, yeah. The sooner we get this out of our stores the better."**


[5/19/2023 6:55 PM] Kaedues Staub
**"Tell me about it. How many pounds of cheese are you working with here?"** *Kaedues starts walking towards the trucks again as if nothing happened at all. Much about Kaedues' movements are generic. In a sense, the guy does not stand out at all. Even though He has naturally beet-red hair it doesn't stand out much around all of the people who dye.*

*Kaedues' outfit also ties into this. He wears drab jumpsuits--often green or gray-- in tandem with custom fitted combat boots. He always liked to appeal to the military like that.*


[5/19/2023 7:05 PM] Gavyn
He would go on to say, **"Three tons. The boys working already got 1 ton loaded up in those trailers pulled off to the side there. I got my truckers coming from the Fairview depot down here to help with the additional transporting. We transport pretty much everything as long as their paying."** He would slap his hand against the raised loading dock aside the trailer that was currently being loaded. **"There will always be a market for logistics, ha!"**


[5/19/2023 7:40 PM] Kaedues Staub
**"Well, I never agreed to be your employee but don't think I won't work for you if you have the money behind the request. I'll do anything."** *Kaedues enters the warehouse and begins stacking boxes of cheese on top of each other in his hands.*

**"And-- what do you think of Fairview?"**


[5/19/2023 7:44 PM] Gavyn
**"Fairview? Well its alright. Much safer than Haven Heights. CCR keeps people in check and as long as the rules are followed no one gives a shit."**


[5/19/2023 7:46 PM] Gavyn
**"Know a girl in Fairview, secretary to the company I work for, Loft Logistics. __Really__ talented in what she do. Education there is much better there too."**


[5/19/2023 7:47 PM] Gavyn
**"No one in their right minds would come down here to Haven Heights. Especially if you have micros."**


[5/19/2023 7:52 PM] Kaedues Staub
*Kaedues turns around to face Gavyn, now holding three boxes of cheese. His form is pretty good, letting all the weight fall on his legs.* **"You make a lot of good points-- Did I ever get your name?"** *He walks out of the warehouse with cheese in hand, moving towards the nearest trailer to load.*


[5/19/2023 7:52 PM] Gavyn
**"Ah! Gavyn. I go by Gavyn or Gav."**


[5/19/2023 7:55 PM] Kaedues Staub
**"Well you make a lot of good points Gavyn. But I just couldn't work down in Fairview, there aren't as many jobs there for me. A guy like me needs to have busy hands for a nice time, you get it?"** *Kaedues sets the CHEESE STACK up in the trailer before leaping up inside. He moves the cheese towards the back now.*


[5/19/2023 8:01 PM] Gavyn
**"You're like the uhh... Jack of all trades ya?"**


[5/19/2023 8:02 PM] Kaedues Staub
**"That's the goal!"** *He says now hopping down from the trailer and moving back towards the warehouse. He has a lot of work to do, but he never minds.* **"So do you supervise or are you a manager over here?"**


[5/19/2023 8:04 PM] Gavyn
**"I manage, been the manager for a few months. Corporate needed someone who actually isn't a fuckin' moron and I guess I was the best out of the bunch."**


[5/19/2023 8:10 PM] Kaedues Staub
**"Good to know. You sound like a good egg too. Someone who isn't a complete chore to be around or get orders from."** *Kaedues creates another CHEESE STACK within the warehouse. He makes haste, continuing to unload the boxes of cheese into the trailer ahead.*


[5/19/2023 8:16 PM] Gavyn
**"..."** He watched Kaedues with a bit of wonder.
> "This guy is nuts. He's working three times as fast as Carlos."
**"Isn't that so?"**


[5/19/2023 8:23 PM] Kaedues Staub
**"I never complain to anyone, but if I did complain it would be to someone like Terrence. The man hardly sounds like he knows anything about our work."** *Kaedues enters the warehouse again to form another CHEESE STACK for the trailer. He opts this time to walk backwards in an attempt to make his life easier. Taking a step towards the ramp, his foot catches the lip of the ramp and causes Kaedues to stumble and fall backwards!* **"Shit--"** ***__PTOOM__*** *He hits the ground hard, but the cheese... doesn't. With one hand, Kaedues keeps a firm grip on the stack and does not let it fall apart.*


[5/19/2023 8:25 PM] Gavyn
**"!"** He would jump up like he was going to do something. ~~We all know he wasn't going to be able to actually jump up and do anything.~~ **"Bud!...."** He noticed the out of place ability that the guy had. **"Shit..man I feel bad that you fell but god damn, how the hell you holding that heavy shit up with one arm? Without Cybernetics!?"**


[5/19/2023 8:29 PM] Kaedues Staub
*Slowly getting up and keeping in mind to balance the stack, Kaedues replies* **"Agh.... Never fun to have a fall at work. It's fine though..."** *He gets up and starts placing the boxes in the back of the trailer like usual.* **"For your question, I don't know!"** *He's yelling from the back.* **"Everyone is good at something, right?"**


[5/19/2023 8:30 PM] Gavyn
He was still having a hard time processing what the actual fuck he was witnessing. **"....I guess."**


[5/19/2023 8:32 PM] Kaedues Staub
*Kaedues exits the truck like nothing happened.* **"So management huh? Normally I don't ask, but what made you catch the management wind?"** *He's taking this next load a little slowly just to give his body the good grace.*


[5/19/2023 8:36 PM] Gavyn
**"I never really wanted to go management. I was just a machine operator for a while. Since I was....6? Worked for 2 Micros an hour. I just happened to fall into it because I don't take anyone's shit I guess."**


[5/19/2023 8:38 PM] Kaedues Staub
**"Hard times. I know what it is like to work for so little.... My answer? Work more jobs."**

[5/19/2023 8:38 PM] Kaedues Staub
*With that, Kaedues forms another CHEESE STACK within the warehouse and begins moving it back towards the trailer as he did before. No backwards walking this time.*


[5/19/2023 8:47 PM] Gavyn
**"Shit buddy, no one in their right mind would pass up on hiring you."**


[5/19/2023 8:47 PM] Narration
It was ridiculous in which the rate Kaedues was working. It got to the point where the other workers were watching him more than working alongside him.


[5/19/2023 9:02 PM] Kaedues Staub
**"Now you see why I'm so bent out of shape over this transfer?"** *Kaedues walks briskly back towards the warehouse. He cracks his fingers and opts to stack 4 boxes of cheese this time instead of the 3 he has been working with so far. The carry load slows him down a little, but he doesn't appear to be under stress...*

*Inside, Kaedues is going through the motions. He tells himself, 'Just do it'. Nothing serious, just get the job done.*

**"It bothers me."**


[5/19/2023 9:03 PM] Gavyn
**"No believe me, I get it. Plan on confronting him about it?"**


[5/19/2023 9:09 PM] Kaedues Staub
**"Yeah I do. I'm torn on how though... I would need to choose my words carefully."** *Kaedues unloads the boxes into the trailer again. As Kaedues talks about this problem he is experiencing, he starts to walk faster to and from the trailer.*

**"As you said. He is the kind of person to follow the path of least resistance. If he is even so much as offput from the way I approach him he may very well turn me down without a second thought."** *Kaedues grabs another stack of 4 from the warehouse.*


[5/19/2023 9:12 PM] Gavyn
He rested his arms on the loading dock. Still standing on the ground level where the truck's trailer was. **"If you can't talk to him, I think I know someone who will get him to talk. But that would require some strings to be pulled around."**


[5/19/2023 9:13 PM] Gavyn
**"Someone who Terrence could not resist or brush off."**

[5/19/2023 9:19 PM] Gavyn
**"Because it's his mom."** He'd snicker.

**"He's a mama's puss boy to keep it a buc."**


[5/19/2023 9:25 PM] Gavyn
**"I could tell her how bad her son has screwing over my boy and problem will solve itself. That's if he doesn't give you the light of day to speak your piece, ya know?"**


[5/19/2023 9:39 PM] Kaedues Staub
**"You know what? I'll keep that in mind moving forward. You have an eye for the right thing, Gav."** *Kaedues moves back to the warehouse, where he gathers the final stack of the bunch. This last trip to the trailer is far slower than anything other one he's done today.*


[5/19/2023 9:41 PM] Gavyn
**"...You're done already?!"**


[5/19/2023 10:11 PM] Kaedues Staub
**"That's what you're paying me for."** *He dusts off his hands and walks toward Gavyn. His gait is bouncy and lifelike--a walk that reflects his work ethic and forward moving attitude.* **"Now that I've properly met you I think I should introduce myself."** *Kaedues stands in front of Gavyn and holds an open hand forward.* **"I am Kaedues Staub."**


[5/19/2023 10:13 PM] Gavyn
**"It's a damn honor, Kaedues but wh-dude you've only been here for 20 minutes! I can't just pay you a fraction of your rate!"**


[5/19/2023 10:17 PM] Kaedues Staub
**"Then don't bother. Actually, let me put you on to something. Are you much of a coffee guy?"** *Kaedues completely dimisses all payment like it never mattered in the first place. To him, Gavyn is right. He thought he'd be doing that for hours but he didn't do enough work. According to himself at least...*


[5/19/2023 10:18 PM] Gavyn
**"I mean...sometimes I guess I am a coffee guy."**


[5/19/2023 10:39 PM] Kaedues Staub
*Kaedues gestures for Gavyn to follow him to his Portable Mistake.*

[5/19/2023 10:46 PM] Kaedues Staub
*On the way there, he elaborates...* **"I have a piece of gum whenever I do a side job like this. I'd like to share a piece with you if that's your thing."**


[5/19/2023 10:51 PM] Gavyn
**"Uuh, make sure joe gets here on time!"** He would shout at his guys before catching back up to Kaedues. When Kaedues offered gum. **"I'm fine, not much of a gum guy. Feeds into my infinite hunger."**


[5/19/2023 10:55 PM] Kaedues Staub
**"Oh, okay. Well, do you need anything else done then?"** *He turns back to Gavyn since he wasn't interested.*


[5/19/2023 10:56 PM] Gavyn
**"Uhh... no the cheese was suppose to be a all day thing."**


[5/19/2023 10:57 PM] Kaedues Staub
**"Alright. Well, it was nice meeting you Gavyn. I'm going to go home and figure out how to move forward with all of this."**


[5/19/2023 11:00 PM] Gavyn
**"Ok, yeah man! It was fantastic. If you ever have free time, stop on by. You have my number already, and good luck with Terrence."**


[5/19/2023 11:07 PM] Kaedues Staub
**"Sounds good."** *Kaedues takes another breath in before work is done for the day. The humid spring air feels overbearing to some but comforting to Kaedues, who is used to working in much worse weather. He even goes so far as to stretch-- extending his arms and legs, touching his toes and letting out a satisfying groan.* **"See you later!"** *He says before entering his van.*

*The first thing Kaedues does when he gets in is turn on the radio. Check the mirrors? Buckle in? Of course those are first priority. But not this time.*

[5/19/2023 11:08 PM] Kaedues Staub
*With his windows rolled up it's much harder to see how quickly the man's demeanor changes. He calmly backs up before exiting the parking lot. He has a lot of thinking to do on the way home....*


[5/20/2023 12:54 AM] Gavyn
He would watch as Kaedues drove out **"..Huh."**

[5/26/2023 12:22 AM] Narration
Kaedues' pulled into the warehouse without a hitch! Just as Gavyn had said, the side door was partially open.


[5/26/2023 12:22 AM] James Carter
**"This the place? Thank god, this tin can smells like shit."**


[5/26/2023 12:25 AM] Kaedues Staub
*Kaedues takes the keys out of the ignition after they make a complete halt.* **"Good news for you then, we can leave."** *Kaedues gestures to the door. Whole thing is manual-- no door openers anywhere in this van. It's time for the clown car to unload.*


[5/26/2023 12:26 AM] James Carter
He would open the door with little regard, hopping out and clearing the area for the other two to exit.


[5/26/2023 12:28 AM] Grace Dawson
She came out with her things, looking around nervously. Being this far into Haven Heights? Never in her life. It was scary to say the least. She clutched her things, her heart pounding in her chest. She knew no one here but these two and had no idea what to expect. Taking a deep breath, she stepped forward into the unknown.


[5/26/2023 12:32 AM] Kaedues Staub
*Kaedues notices Grace's visible anxiety as he exits after them. He closes and locks the lone door of the van after everyone and points toward the opened side door.* **"That's where we're headed, see? We're looking for a man on the inside, goes by Carlos. He has a dye press we can use without any risk of rousing suspicion from corporate."** *Kaedues starts to swiftly walk towards the side door, not without looking around just for the sake of it though. He lowers his voice now to talk,* **"__I want this to go off without a hitch, so I'm not going to risk even telling the nightshift workers about this. Not to mention how much time it will save us."__** *He lets the both of them know what he is thinking as they approach the entrance out of good faith.*


[5/26/2023 12:43 AM] James Carter
**"Makes sense, let's get this over with."**


[5/26/2023 12:44 AM] Narration
The group would enter the warehouse. Being met by Gavyn that was already heading their way.


[5/26/2023 12:44 AM] Gavyn
**"Hey Kaedues."** He'd wave as he waltzed over.


[5/26/2023 12:44 AM] James Carter
**"...Who's this fat fuck?"** He'd mutter.


[5/26/2023 12:45 AM] Grace Dawson
She would look around the warehouse. Not really paying attention to Gavyn's approach.


[5/26/2023 12:48 AM] Kaedues Staub
**"Hey, Gav. Care pointing us towards your main man?"** *Kaedues asks kindly and bruntly. Each of his hands hang at his sides clutching their own sheet of dense gun metal. He holds them so tightly that his fingertips appear a mix of of dry, pale yellow and feverish red.*


[5/26/2023 12:49 AM] Gavyn
**"Yeah, he's through those double doors there."** He'd rotate around and point.


[5/26/2023 12:51 AM] Kaedues Staub
**"Thanks again,"** *He says as he moves straight to where Gavyn gestures. He walks up to the doors, striding like he usually does. Kaedues' walk is iconic especially when he's at work; He is precise even for things like this that seem like non-thoughts.*

*When the set of doors slide open to Kaedues' sides he bares witness to a room he has never seen before. What does he see?*


[5/26/2023 12:54 AM] Narration
Kaedues sees what looks like a workshop, mechanic shop for their trucks, and an overfill for stock. A plethora of just stuff!


[5/26/2023 12:54 AM] Carlos
**"Kaedues right?"** He was waiting by the dye just off to the left. Tossing a tool in the air and catching repeatedly.

[5/26/2023 12:59 AM] Kaedues Staub
**"That would be me,"** *He assures this new guy.* **"And you're Carlos? Nice to meet you. We have all the materials, schematics and manpower to finish the job. All we need is this press and a little bit of your time, and we'll be out of your hair."** *Kaedues walks over to the dye press and motions Grace to catch up by nodding his head. His hands are occupied after all.*


[5/26/2023 1:03 AM] Carlos
**"Aye, no problem mi compadre."** He would power on the dye press with a the tool. Flipping it into a reverse grip and pressing the button on the terminal interface with the tip of the wrench. **"I get paid by the hour by boss man so take as much time you need compa√±ero."**


[5/26/2023 1:04 AM] Grace Dawson
Grace stood on Kaedues' flank. Setting down most of the prints so that she could unravel a few.


[5/26/2023 1:05 AM] James Carter
He made himself comfortable, watching from the side.


[5/26/2023 1:09 AM] Kaedues Staub
***"Te agradezco*, Carlos."** *Kaedues takes a big breath to calm his nerves. Important here especially since he's getting to work, and that caffeinated gum is definitely pulling through right about now. He looks down at Grace.* **"I need the blueprints for the individual parts first."**


[5/26/2023 1:10 AM] Grace Dawson
**"Here are all the internals."** She would hand him the blueprint.


[5/26/2023 1:14 AM] Kaedues Staub
*Taking it,* **"Thanks."** *With that said, Kaedues gets to work carefully cutting out sections of the metal he brought. The work in front of him is precision work, which means he has to take it slow and steady. Kaedues brought two sheets, a generous amount of metal but __not__ lenient. If he has room for mistakes at all, it'll be just one. In other words Kaedues only has the one shot.*

*Here is where Kaedues' attention to detail comes into play. He works as someone with his amount of experience should work; He is calm and collected even understanding how little wiggle room they have.*


[5/26/2023 1:17 AM] Carlos
He would lean on the side of the machine. **"You lucked out, called boss man today and not tomorrow, ese. Today's my last day, man."**


[5/26/2023 1:18 AM] Kaedues Staub
**"......That right?"** *Kaedues shoots back. It takes him a moment to respond to anything the guy says while working.* **"......Where are you going?"**


[5/26/2023 1:23 AM] Carlos
**"I don't know yet, bro. Got a few offers in Fairview and plenty more around Heights. There are a bunch of places out there looking for tool and die makers, man."**


[5/26/2023 1:26 AM] Kaedues Staub
**"You don't mean to say you own this dye press?"** *Kaedues asks just to be sure. Around this time, he finishes carving out all of the internal pieces. Just a testament to how efficiently Kaedues can work.*

*He turns to Grace,* **"The chassis next,"** *extending a hand like a surgeon asking for a scalpel. Witnessing the guy work makes the robots get jealous.*


[5/26/2023 1:30 AM] Carlos
**"Yeah, man, it's mine. Bought it with my own micros, you know?"**


[5/26/2023 1:30 AM] Grace Dawson
She would hand the second schematic.


[5/26/2023 1:37 AM] Kaedues Staub
**"Making the big buys. You're a man who knows what he wants,"** *Kaedues comments as he gets to work cutting out the flat sections of the chassis. Now it's more evident than ever that Kaedues is very efficient with his usage of metal as well; He goes out of his way to reposition the sheet at times so he takes up less space. To anyone familiar though (like Carlos), this is just normal.*

**"That's good. You're gonna go far, man."** *Kaedues gets done with even the chassis somewhat quickly. On the table, it looks like something a toddler drew with a geometric template from math class. He takes the leftover gun metal and sets it on the floor next to himself before loading up the second piece.* **"Last one,"** *He says to Grace with a hand extended.*


[5/26/2023 1:38 AM] Grace Dawson
**"Last one~"**


[5/26/2023 1:44 AM] Kaedues Staub
*Kaedues takes the blueprint and gets to work. This last bit doesn't take very long even for what we have seen so far, considering the magazine is simpler than the rest of it. The sound has been droning and annoying so far, but that final snap of the blade freeing up the cut out piece of the magazine gives Kaedues the finality he needs to stop and take a breath.*

*He steps away, looking at the entire selection of parts (that he had placed on a nearby table). Adding the magazine to them feels like winning.* **"Next, we need to shape the parts. You know how that goes,"** *He says turning to Carlos.*


[5/26/2023 1:46 AM] Carlos
**"Yeah, got just what you need ese. Follow me."**


[5/26/2023 1:47 AM] Kaedues Staub
*Kaedues nods and takes the unshapen parts along with him as he follows Carlos.....*

The smog lingering in the air was insufferable to most who enter the industrial sector outside of occasional visits. Many of the people that walked the paths wore respirators or masks to slow the effects of the fumes.

Cat didn't inherently 'blend' in. But, for all tense and purposes didn't stand out. A good thing to note since the CCR is out for blood.

Cat was stepping away from the sidewalk and partially in an alleyway. Beat-up vehicles and commercial trucks driving by at various speeds. Pedestrians commonly coughing, sneezing, and what not.

She was near an abandoned warehouse that was well on its way to becoming a pile of rubble. Nothing was out of the ordinary for now. All that was left was to contact Nico and get the rest of the data.


[9/23/2024 1:25 PM] Cat Bayes
*Alright, keep your cool now Cat. You're on your way to becoming a professional in this industry, time to act like it.*

*Lifting her hands up of the polyester hood covering her head, she pinched it's sides and swung it down onto her back before lowering her facemask. Even with it on, she could feel the smog and chemicals in the air burning in her throat, forcing her to cough every so often. Hopefully she won't contract any diseases from this mission...*

*Looking around to make sure nobody was tailing her, she leaned her shoulder against a crumbling wall and mentally shifted through her contacts, eyes flashing a bright orange as she rung Nico up.* 
```fix
["Hey y≈´jin (friend), you-you there? I'm at the spot."]
```
*The netrunner announced, the natural latency within her mind causing words to skip or repeat every so often. Her fingertips idly rolled along the handle of her revolver in her pocket. Hopefully she wouldn't have to use it...*

This should be a cake walk, got a organization that has been flaking out on D. He wants to know why and that is where you come in. We need you to tap into their network and install a virus I built. Sending code to you now. Who knows, maybe you'll find some use for it in your own endeavors. 

<:;;$%#@@, You should be looking at a fenced off facility. You'll need to find their network room and inject the code into a unlocked terminal. Security is pretty solid, but I am certain you'll manage. If you have any questions, you know how to reach me. ^$!ADf47#jU

The facility was designed with a simple layout that allowed for maximum security. It was a massive, metal block with barbed wiring running along the top of its walls and only one entrance visible from the outside. There were no windows in sight, and the few doors present were well-hidden or heavily guarded. The only way in seemed to be through the gate along the alleyway, which had several armed guards stationed at it, watching lazily at anyone who approached closely.

[9/24/2024 9:23 PM] Cat Bayes
*Noticing the upload bar appearing in the upper righthand corner of her vision, she gave a quick nod to the disembodied voice in her head before peaking around the corner! With the facility coming into view, Cat made sure not to dip her head too far past her cover to keep herself hidden from sight.*

*Nico wasn't kidding about the security, they had pretty much all of the obvious entrances well guarded, and the only viable entry point had far too many eyes for her to simply walk into the front gate. However, quantity could never beat quality. Booting up her cyberdeck, she began to scan the environment for any weaknesses she might be able to exploit.*


[9/24/2024 9:32 PM] Narration
Running a scan of the area, Cat found that most of the security was centered around the main entrance, with cameras and guards monitoring every angle. But, as she looked closer, she noticed a small hatch near the corner of the building that seemed to be less heavily guarded than the rest. Upon further inspection, it became clear that the hatch connected to their exterior access control system. If she could hack into the system, she might be able to disable the locks and sneak inside.

She'll need to get inside the fence first near the hatch while also dealing with that camera was overlooked it.


[9/24/2024 9:37 PM] Cat Bayes
*Bingo, that's her way in. Now just to deal with the brainless asshats at the gate. They had pretty much every angle she could possibly imagine in their sights, but with how bored they looked...maybe they'd be easy to distract.*

*Running a `Ping` command, she searched for any potential noisemakers nearby, something loud enough to make them investigate...*


[9/24/2024 9:39 PM] Narration
Cat's ping command revealed that there was a malfunctioning camera nearby. With a weettle bit of finesse, she could manipulate the camera to emit a loud screeching noise, drawing the guards' attention away from the front gate.


[9/24/2024 9:53 PM] Cat Bayes
`"See, this is why you update your firmware guys."` *Internally chuckling at her mental quip, she rose her fingers to her temple and got to work. They clearly focused more of their attention on dealing with normal people rather than attacks from the cybernet, as she was easily able to infiltrate the malfunctioning camera's systems and access it's power supply.*

*Nothing personal, Mister Camera, but your sacrifice will not be in vain. With just a little nudge to it's maximum voltage output, the camera began to sparkle and sizzle...before violently spinning on it's hinge like a helicopter on fire!*


[9/24/2024 10:01 PM] Narration
**"And so, I told the choom. You shouldn't be shoving it in so forcefu-"** One of the guards would go to say before...

**R2D2 NOISES**

**"What the fuck, choomba?"** The other said, as they both turned their attention to the camera. **"Ah, shit. E2 camera is doing that stupid-ass shit again. Go tell maintenance to get off their damn asses and replace the damned thing."** 

**"Hold on, are we seriously not going to address what that bolt-bucket was talking about a moment ago?"** A third one interjected. Clearly __HUNG__ up on that unfinished sentence.
**"Address what?"**

Oh yeah, they are distracted alright.


[9/24/2024 10:16 PM] Cat Bayes
**"..."*** *Wait, no, that third guy was onto something. What the fuck was that guy talking about? SHE NEEDS TO KNOW DAMNIT-*

*Fuck, shit, stay focused Cat. You have a job to do, and no amount of out-of-pocket conversations will stop you from accomplishing that task. With the guards attention now focused on the spinning camera of death, Cat was able to sneakily maneuver close enough to the fence where she wouldn't be immediately spotted if they turned back around.*

*She didn't have long - maybe a minute or so before the circuit in the camera completely burned out - but hopefully that's all she needed. Reaching into her back pocket, she whipped out a sturdy pair of wire cutters and began to strategically snip away at few links near the bottom - enough to make a small hole for her to get through.*


[9/24/2024 10:39 PM] Narration
One by one, the links were being snipped by the wire cutters and soon there was enough opening to fit, well, a cat if she were to crawl through. All that was left was to get her little ass in that hatch!


[9/24/2024 10:49 PM] Cat Bayes
*Perfect! Now all that was left to do was solider crawl her skinny little Cat booty through the narrow opening she's made! ~~...Nope, don't think about it. You're perfect as you are girl.~~

*Slipping through the hole, she quickly scrambled to the nearest cover she could find that was out of view from the guards. So far so good, but she wasn't in the clear yet. Now she needed to get into the building and find the terminal...like Nico said, cakewalk.*

*Taking a moment to catch her breath, she turned her attention to the corner of the facility, where that pesky camera was keeping her from her goal. Not for long it wasn't, if she had anything to say about it...*


[9/24/2024 10:59 PM] Cat Bayes
*Once more, she dove into the cybernetic spectrum of her netrunning optics, determined to knock out the problem and get herself into that building. What kind of security was that camera packing?*


[9/24/2024 11:02 PM] Narration
Security camera was some cheap thrift-store knock off. Firmware updates stopped with this particular brand eons agos. Nothing her deck couldn't handle.


[9/24/2024 11:09 PM] Cat Bayes
`"..."` *Nope, she wasn't even gonna make a quip for this one. This was just sad.*

*Still, she couldn't get cocky here, lest she tip off the bad guys to her uninvited entrance. Easily breaching into the camera's software, she found the live feed of the security footage and set the recording to a five second loop of what it was currently seeing.*

*Now, she was practically invisible, unless an actual human spotted her of course. Scurrying her way over to the hatch, she began to tamper with the electronic lock keeping it in place, occasionally looking over her shoulder for any stray dumbasses heading her way...*


[9/24/2024 11:15 PM] Narration
Roughly 20 seconds elasped before the lock beeped and the LED indicator turned green!


[9/24/2024 11:21 PM] Cat Bayes
*Fuck yeah, she's just that good.*

*Slowly opening the hatch, she once again got into prone position and crawled her way into the narrow maintenance corridor, securing her seamless entrance into the facility!*


[9/25/2024 7:39 PM] Narration
Cat crawled into the hatch and crawled through a fairly straight forward crawlspace. The space's steel casing was frigid, if any exposed skin made direct contact would make her shiver uncontrollably. Once she neared the end of the crawlspace, the building's humming interior emerged into the foreground. Ahead of her was another hatch that overlooked some kind of walkway below.


[9/27/2024 7:38 PM] Cat Bayes
*Alright, inside the building, so far so good. Now she just has to-* **"Tsk!"** *She suddenly bit back a sharp hiss as her wrist made contact with the freezing metal, tiny little daggers poking at her exposed skin!*

*She'll have to be careful in here if she wanted to make it out of this mission without catching a cold. Pulling her hands back into her sleeves, she continued making her way through the crawlspace until she arrived at the opposite hatch. This one seemed to overlook some kind of walkway...before she went about opening it, she decided to check and see if there were any goons about.*

There were no immediate sounds that indicated a goon lurking about. The ambient noise of the factory was the only sounds reaching Cat's ears.

*Mmmhh...She couldn't really leave it to chance now, she was too far in to make a rookie mistake and get caught here. Engaging her cyberdeck, she ran a quick ping command to reveal any hidden traps.*


[9/28/2024 7:27 PM] Narration
In an instant, her augmented reality display flared up, revealing a web of security she'd have never noticed otherwise. The hatch directly below her was rigged‚Äîtamper-wired to trigger alarms with even the slightest unauthorized movement. And just beneath the vent she was tucked into, two cybernetic sentries were mounted on the walls, their optics scanning in rhythmic precision. One false move, and those things would turn her into scrap. Just who were these guys again??


[9/28/2024 7:40 PM] Cat Bayes
```"Holy fuck!"```


[9/28/2024 7:45 PM] Cat Bayes
*Alarms rang out within her mind as the red lights flashed on her retina, revealing the frankly unnecessary amount of security that was revealed by her scan! Preemptively, she backed away from the rigged hatch and took a moment to catch her breath. If she went in just then, she would've been ripped to shreds by those sentry turrets, and even if she somehow survived that...*

*No, no - she can't think about that. She was lucky enough to remain on the cautious rather than the reckless, and it's not like the mission's over yet. She'll just have to figure out how to turn off their security...Did her scan reveal any way to bypass their network by any chance?*

Her cyberdeck still hummed softly, the scan data ticking through her augmented vision, highlighting the intricate network of nodes and defense protocols. Then something caught her eye‚Äîan unguarded node pulsing in a forgotten corner of the system. A maintenance access point. It wasn‚Äôt connected to the primary security systems, likely overlooked by whoever designed this digital deathtrap. Jackpot.

If she could jack into it remotely, she might be able to spoof the system into thinking the area was under maintenance. That would reroute the sentries‚Äô targeting systems temporarily, long enough for her to slip through unnoticed.

The hatch was still wired, but with the turrets offline, she could have room to work. There was a subtle energy signature indicated a relay point tucked behind the thin aluminum duct. It was close enough for her to tap into if she could find the physical access. Perhaps look for some pilot screws, and a handle?


[9/28/2024 8:26 PM] Cat Bayes
*Hah! Perfect, just what she needed. These guys might outgun her in every way, but they haven't out...Cybernetted her.*

*Ahem.*

*Ignoring the blatantly terrible analogy in her head, she once more engaged her cybernetics and was about to hack into the maintenance node...before something else had caught her attention. What was that strange energy signature doing there? It seemed to be behind a panel that was screwed into crawlspace...perhaps it had something to do with the building's electrical system? It would make sense, given how stupidly cold it was in here!*

*Since curiosity never did anything bad to cats, she decided to give it a look. Whipping out her wire cutters once more, she carefully went about twisting the screws out from the panel with the sharp, pointed edge of the metal tool.*


[9/28/2024 8:38 PM] Narration
**POP!** The panel swung down and hit her arm. It weight nothing so all it did was apply some pressure. Beyond the door was a nest of wires with no sense of organization. The insulation sleeves of the cables were frosted. Deeper within was a circuit board with led indicator lights. 

**PWR - Green, Solid**
**HEART - Yellow, Blinking**
**LINK -  Green, Solid**

She would have to work around these cables and see what exactly is going on.


[9/28/2024 8:52 PM] Cat Bayes
**"!..."** *A slight wince made her tense up as the frigid panel fell onto the sleeve of her jacket, before the lack of noise or vibration allowed her to breathe again. Now, what exactly was she working with...?*

*Alright, so PWR was pretty self-explanatory, she could look at that later...but what the hell were Heart and Link supposed to be? Tracing her finger along the jumbled mess of wires and utilizing her cyber vision, she tried to make sense of where each of these systems led.*


[9/28/2024 9:03 PM] Narration
It appears whoever installed the system used way too much wire for the panel. Taking the time to shift through it revealed that there was only 5 wires connecting to the panel. 

**Blue, Purple, Yellow, Green, and Red.** They were traced to headers on the panel. **Blue M1, Purple M3, Yellow M2, Green M4, and Red M5**  Each header had another LED on them, showing activity on the lines. The green wire was the only one blinking.


[9/28/2024 9:15 PM] Cat Bayes
*...Who the fuck installed this system?*

*Cat might not be an electrical engineer, but even she could tell this whole jungle of a mess was put together by a fucking amateur...or by someone trying to make life harder for intruders like her - which, if that was the case - then fair play, dickwad.*

*Well, no use moaning about shit she can't control. Messing with this panel might either help or screw her over in the long run, but it couldn't hurt figuring out what this stuff did.  Speaking of which, what was this panel even connected to? Would the ping command she ran earlier provide her any clues?*


[9/28/2024 9:18 PM] Narration
The response from the ping command was confusing. Whatever this panel was, it was nothing the cyberdeck was capable of deciphering. It was not that the panel was hi-tech, it could be that it was just **that old.**


[9/28/2024 9:23 PM] Cat Bayes
*Okay, yeah no. She's hacking whoever put this building together after this. What were they even expecting, trying to mesh this ancient hardware with their tech? A miracle or something?*

*Still, even if she couldn't see what the panel connected to, she might be able to reveal some hints about the panel itself if she kept digging. Just try to separate the redundancies and the cluttered noise, make sense of the mess...*

As she began decluttering, the manufacturer information began revealing itself.
**Yorkton Inc, 2104**
**Model ID: 40ET-10FF-30HJ-98ZX**
**Version: 0.03e**
**Manufactured In: London, UK**


[9/28/2024 9:45 PM] Cat Bayes
*Wait, what the fuck? London, UK? Is that some place in the higher districts she didn't know about? No, that couldn't be...if that was the case, then she would've seen it in cyberspace a long time ago. None of this made any sense, especially that year. Why were these guys still using tech that was made well over a century ago?*

*None of this information was helping her, but she can still investigate more about it later. Setting that aside for now, Cat continued to dig through the software's subroutines, trying to find out what turned on and off what.*


[9/28/2024 9:50 PM] Narration
Further investigation revealed that the data coming from the Green wire corresponded with the blinking heartbeat light. This line ran into a much larger network within the facility. That could be where the terminal she needed to access was! The other wires ran into other weather control units. This was just a controller hub. Whoever rigged this place also ran an security line through this panel. 

Killing the green wire would certainly send a message somewhere regarding connectivity lost. It was just a message being sent back and fourth to the main hub. The Red vanshed outside the panel but linked to the panel that lead to the walkway. Perhaps she needed to disconnect the Red wire?


[9/28/2024 10:01 PM] Cat Bayes
*Alright, now things were starting to add up. She could see where each wire connected where, and that green wire? It showed her 'exactly' where her target was, perfect! Knowing now that she should probably leave that green wire alone, she turned her attention to the red wire.*

*So this little thing was powering the security hatch into the hallway, huh? Innnnteresting. While the other wires might've seemed useless at first glance, the fact that they led to weather control units might be useful to her. This might seem like a stretch, but in her mind, security panels don't just deactivate on their own.*

*With that in mind, she pulled out the __Blue__ wire first, then the __Red__ wire a few seconds later. Uh-oh guys, maybe relying on old tech isn't the best idea after all!*


[9/28/2024 10:12 PM] Narration
The hatch door leading the walk-way would de-energize and swing open! Panel was now flashing **LINK-YELLOW**


[9/28/2024 10:28 PM] Cat Bayes
*Oh! So that's what Link meant, good to know! Satisfied with her work, she quickly reattached the panel to the wall and secured the screws. Now, she can focus her attention back on that node she saw earlier!*

*Re-engaging her cyber vision, she tilted her gaze to the pulsating node that toggled the maintenance override. Once she does this, things are gonna start happening real fast, and she won't have much space for breathing. But hopefully all the prep she did with that panel will make this next part go a little smoother.*

*With that in mind, she remotely jacked into the node and activated it.*


[9/28/2024 10:30 PM] Narration
**"Maintenance in progress.... Maintenance in progress... Maintenance in progress..."** An audible alert sounded thrice before fading into nothing ness....


[9/28/2024 10:34 PM] Cat Bayes
*Fuck, that was louder than she'd hoped it would be.*

*Crawling to the end of the vent, she gripped her hands around the rim of the open hatch and swung her body down into the hall, holding her breath in anticipation for what happened next.* 

-# Pleasenoturretspleasenoturretspleasenoturretspleasenoturrets-

*If she was safe from being ripped to shred by a maelstrom of bullets, what did the hallway look like?*


[9/28/2024 10:38 PM] Narration
The hallway was actually a large open area with suspended walkways zig and zagging throughout the facility. LED lights illuminated the area with amber lights emphasizing specific locations. There were three immediate doors. One to her front, and two on either side of her. The turrets located on the walls were deactivated and pointing down. Good, no turrets!

*Good, no turrets- eh? Woah, this was a lot bigger than she was expecting it to be.*
-# that came out a lot weirder than she wanted - moving on.

*Seriously, just who in the world was she infiltrating? This is one hell of an operation they have going here, but they seem to cut corners quite often with their security. Well, not that she was complaining.*

*Alright, now she was in the main facility, and she had a decent idea where her target was. She couldn't waste any time, either she'd have to deal with the turrets coming back online soon or security coming to check on the hatch, and she had no way of dealing with either of those.*

*The trace she ran on the green wire earlier should tell her where her target was, now which of these doors are gonna lead her to the end of the rainbow?*


[9/28/2024 10:52 PM] Narration
The door to her left!


[9/28/2024 10:55 PM] Cat Bayes
*Jolly good!*

*Like the (~~C~~)rat she was, the skinny little netrunner scurried her way over to the door until her shoulder was pressed against the frame! Sending a quick command to it's software, the door's hydraulics hissed as it slid open! What was she dealing with in here?*

There are several terminals in a small server room. A multitude of screens display data at varying speeds. The hum of cooling fans fills the air, creating a constant, soothing background noise. The dim lighting casts a soft glow on the sleek surfaces of the equipment, giving the room an almost futuristic ambiance. Occasionally, the flicker of LED indicators adds a touch of rhythm to the otherwise steady environment. 

She'll have to jack-in and see exactly which terminal she'd need to access to inject the virus.

Bingo, an address matched a keyword search in the source code Nico provided. Terminal B, which was to her immediate right. That is where she needed to upload the virus.


[9/28/2024 11:15 PM] Cat Bayes
*So far, so good. Assuming all goes according to plan, Nico should see the virus feeding him information pretty soon.*

**"Terminal B, alright...let's see what dirty little secrets you're hiding from me.~"** *She muttered under her breath, switching ports from the central terminal to the rightmost one.*

*Once she was in, she dug up the virus Nico gave her and began uploading to the source code.*


[9/28/2024 11:19 PM] Narration
The virus immediately began to infect the computer. It was also uploading information to Cat. It was a virus designed to enslave a computer and provide a dump file to the host. In this case, Cat, acting as an access point. Once the initial gateway was cleared, it __**HIT**__ A flood of information opened before her like a treasure trove of corporate corruption. As the data decrypted, she noticed the keywords‚Äî"Project Vindications"‚Äîrepeating in several files. If she so chose to, she could open the data packets which will slow down the upload speed to Nico. Or, leave them alone and get this over with quickly.

*As soon that keyword appeared not once, not twice, but **multiple consecutive times**, she didn't even hesitate. Her eyes tensed with curiosity, and her fingers immediately moved to open the data packet. Why the hell did this organization - one that her boss had dealings with - have so many corporate files on their computer?*

Shipment manifests, coded routes, and internal communications flashed by, painting a clear picture. Ammunition, heavy-duty body armor, high-grade weapons‚Äîit was all here. But that wasn‚Äôt the real kicker.

Her eyes narrowed as she spotted a series of specific component deliveries, all linked to BioTek Solutions. Components meant for something‚Ä¶ bigger. There were parts for cybernetic enhancement units, bio-synthetic armor plating, and neural interfaces‚Äîpieces designed to clone living organisms... Cloning? They weren‚Äôt just rerouting military-grade gear; this was something far more **__dangerous__**. The hell did Digit want with these guys?

**"..."** *Woah...woah, wait a minute. This couldn't be right - the data that was being streamed right before her very eyes - you'd only see shit like this in fucking **Sci-Fi movies**. Never mind the ludicrous amounts of armaments they were moving around, what the fuck was Biotek doing with fucking **cloning** tech?!*

*A whirlpool of emotions raged in Cat's mind, her heartrate spiking with every line on the manifesto she read. It wasn't like they were just making another human or something, they were enhancing that human beyond the capabilities of a normal man, and they could just...mass produce it. If even one of these guys hit the streets? It'd be a fucking corpo-controlled massacre.*

*She had to know more, who was in charge of this operation? Where were they moving all of these shipments? The questions were just piling up in her brain, but she couldn't find those answers just yet...Spending any more time around here was bound to bring her nothing but trouble. For now, she just made a seperate file to store all this in for her to look at later, and continued the upload to Nico.*

*Shit, fuck, uh...Okay, the upload's almost done, she can at least stall for time! Whipping her head to the door, she quickly uploaded a command to lock it tight. It'd only last for a minute, but that should give her enough time to finish the upload and find a good hiding spot in the room.*

The instructions for the transmission took effect nearly immediately. The deadbolt mechanism fired up and pivoted; it was now Engaged. An audible bleep was emitted alongside a holographic icon of a red lock projecting just in front of the deadbolt.

Moments after the door engaged, an auditory notification was made. Someone attempted to open the door just then and it rejected their request. "What the hell?" Someone on the other side of the door commented. Confusion was evident in their muffled voices beyond the threshold.

**"Did you forget your badge at the other office?"** Another voice questioned from behind the door. Maybe this was a consistent thing that occurred? 

**"No, you glitch-head... I got it right here."** The original voice replied. 

**"Systems have been acting up left and right today."** Commented the first person's comrade.

**"Yeah, no kidding. A camera went down, management got paged about a disconnected zone and this part of the facility is under maintenance... Now, this door locks itself."** Exasperated the first person. 

**"...Is this door a part of the same networked system?"** inquired the second person. There was some creeping suspicion in his tone. 

**"No... It isn't...Come on, help me override this door choom." **

They were waking up to what was occurring in the facility. That was NOT a good sign. Luckily for our blue-haired vixen, the upload was successfully uploaded to Nico. Now all that was left was to delta out of the place.

*Well that was a bit easier said than done. In what little time she had afforded to her, she hastily wiped whatever trace she left behind on the computer and unjacked herself from the port. Now it was a matter of finding an escape route or a hiding place to keep from the guard's sight, at least until they leave.*

The door to the control room opened with an audible beep and the two men stepped inside. One of the men began to walk over to the server Cat was hiding behind. **"I swear to fucking Christ, if there are any issues with this terminal today, I'm going to shoot someone in the head."** The man, who seemed to be a higher-ranking official than the second, stated firmly. He began to reach his arm around the side of the server. From Cat's perspective, the man's hand was just a mere 6 inches away, reaching for something. There was a data cable free hanging between her and him.

**"Yeah yeah, just keep your cool.  It's just another malfunction, no one is even in here."** The second person replied, seemingly disinterested.

**"Yeah? Well, if it's another malfunction then you get to explain it to the higher ups. It won't be my ass on the line for this. I'll make sure of that, kid."**The official sneered, as his hand grasped onto a small handle on the side of the server rack. **"The hell is that master reset patch?"** He inquired to himself, now really reach back behind the server.

**"You got any gum on ya?"** Asked the younger guard.

**"Gum? Why would I have fucking gum on me?"** Replied the senior.

*Seriously dude?! You're gonna just shove your hand in there, right where she's hiding?! Not cool dude!*

*Okay, okay...you can still salvage this Cat, you've gotten out of tougher situations before! Carefully - and slowly - sliding her hand up the wall, all she had to do was nudge the data cable in his direction and make sure his hand grabbed **that** and not **her**.*

*Her breath was caught in her throat, and her stomach being sucked in so tightly wasn't helping either. You can do this Cat, you can do this...*

He felt his hand bump into something and he instinctively clenched his fingers around it. The cable. The official let out a sigh of relief, he'd been stressed out by a lot of things today and it was nice to get this resolved. He then took the patch and began to plug it into another port elsewhere in the room. Once it was plugged in, the lights in the room dimmed and then shut off completely. The server Cat was behind also ceased to function, turning itself off in an attempt to reboot. The fan noise stopped, as did the LEDs.

**"Dammit."** The senior officer mumbled. He turned around, now walking toward his partner. He then smacked the younger guard on the chest, **"You got some work to do."** The senior then proceeded to walk out of the room.

**"Hey-! What? Come on! That isn't fair, I'm new!"** Pleaded the guard, but it seemed his superior was done with him for today. **"Goddamn it..."** He grumbled, now walking over to the server to attempt the reboot. It was now just him and Cat.. She has to be ***SUUUUUPER QUIET*** since there was no background noise to mask her breathing.

*Wait, why is only one of them leaving? Hey? Hey, hey hey? No - Go with your boss dude, you're done here! Dickwad!*

*Uggggh, okay - it's not like you have anywhere to be right now. You can hang out with Jimmy Jr. over here until he fucks off. That being said, while her visual camouflage has increased with the darkness, the audio in the room had been notably dampened by the reboot...*

*Hmm, if there was still power being run into this room, maybe she could 'help out' with his task, so to speak? What exactly was she working with here?*


[10/13/2024 9:06 PM] Narration
Viewing the terminal's base with her optics, there was still some minimal power coming into this thing, though not enough to actually power it. There was a socket for power that was plugged into the wall that had a loose connection to the socket. It looked as if that senior tech guy had pulled out the cord by accident and now the younger one had to fix his mistake. So...if she could somehow direct his attention towards the power socket, then maybe he'd actually finish the damn job.

There was still some juice at the reciprocal left, enough for a single flash at least.


[10/13/2024 9:10 PM] Cat Bayes
*It'll have to do.*

*Alright Jimmy, you'd better hope to god they give you a promotion for this. The ghost in the machine is gonna lend you a hand.*

*Activating her cyberdeck, she sent a quick command to engage the reciprocal's lighting system. There wasn't a lot of power left, but it might just be enough. Now all that was left to do was hope that the little guy was competent enough to notice the flash.*


[10/13/2024 9:16 PM] Narration
***ZAP***

The reciprocal flashed as power surged into its circuit board, a bright light illuminated the area in front of it for a brief moment. The power surge caused a small pop and the area fell dark once more, now totally without any power.
**"Huh? Oh, I get it now."** He chuckled at himself, **"I can't believe I didn't see that sooner. Well, it's a simple enough fix, and I'm not getting paid any more to work any harder than I have to. Looks like that's my shift over."** The man commented.

He proceeded to fix the socket's power cable, which restored power to the entire server system. A small, dim emergency light activated above the exit. The server started to power on, and the fans began spinning once more.

**"Hell yeah!"** He celebrated. **"That's one in the win column for this week. Now, where's my fucking gum?"** He complained to himself as he walked out of the server room. He left the door unlocked, allowing Cat an opening to exit whenever she pleased.


[10/13/2024 10:32 PM] Cat Bayes
*Yeaaah, your shift is over buddy. Just take your merry ass out of the room and leave it all to Cat! Hehehe...*

*Slipping out from behind the server rack, she collapsed her hands over her knees and breathed a deep sigh of relief. Her brow was drenched in sweat and her hands were shaking from the rush of adrenaline surging through her body. That was **way** too close for comfort, but she still made it through.*

*Now, while that door might seem tempting to a rookie, Cat has been at this for like...a week or two now! Instead, now that she's in the clear, she'll take the vent instead! Genius!*

[10/13/2024 10:38 PM] Narration
The blue haired catgirl pried open the vent door, crawled in, and let herself slide all the way to freedom!
With about 10 minutes of venting, a ventilation lid popped open that led her to a back alley. There was no one in the alleyway and no one in her immediate line of sight. However, there was a man standing at the entrance to the alleyway, talking with someone over the phone. Though, they weren't even looking down the alley!


[10/13/2024 11:31 PM] Cat Bayes
*Sweet! She's pretty much in the clear now! Crawling out of the vent, she quickly closed the hatch behind her and rose to her feet. After a quick brush off, she turned her attention towards the guy down at the end of the alley...There was no way she could tell if he was a guard or not, but she had a way of finding out.*

*Bweeem, hacker time! With a flash of orange, she focused her neon eyes towards his phone and began to listen in on their conversation...*


[10/13/2024 11:39 PM] Narration
**"Ah‚ÄîYeah. We've got a few new hires coming in, but we're short a man in our warehouse crew... I know, I know! Just make sure they know to come into the office when they get here."** He paused for a moment, listening to his partner speak over the line.

**"Yeah? Alright. I'm on it. I'm right outside warehouse right now. Big order just came through this morning, CCR is going to want to lock the place down before its processed. I'll be in touch."** He then tapped his fingers on his arm and hung up the call. He then proceeded to turn around and began to walk towards a nearby door.


[10/13/2024 11:48 PM] Cat Bayes
*...Well, that didn't really tell her much.*

*Oh well, he was leaving anyways, giving Cat ample time to skedaddle while the winds were clear.*


[10/13/2024 11:54 PM] Cat Bayes
*Ah right, she'll have to call Nico and let him know that she cleared the building...but maybe she'll keep what she learned under wraps.*

*He seems like a nice guy, but the information she gathered in there...none of it was good, she'll need to talk to Mathias about this...*

[12/8/2024 8:14 PM] Narration
Emerging from the other side of the thick barrier wall. Ghostgaze was met with darkness, spherical splotches of light danced around the area as the spotlights did their patterns. Perhaps even looking for the elusive terrorist. A Ion Enforcer was not far from him, racing down the street to its destination. Appearing and vanishing as it went behind buildings. 

For Ghost, he was within the shadows in would provide him concealment. Paige said she was going to figure something out. But how and when was still to be answered by Paige. The AV flew over the wall to his right, vanishing behind a smokestack in the distance. The area Ghostgaze had emerged from had a large building to the left with large tanks that housed some sort of fuel or something. In front of him were two buildings that were parallel from each other. A semi in-between the two warehouses were docked at the docks, seemingly being loaded with cargo.


[12/8/2024 8:55 PM] Ghost
*Ghost scanned the area, analysing movements and assessing potential threats as his eyes narrowed beneath the mask. He was injured, and compromising his position now would be **suicide.** Uncertainty loomed over what Paige was up to or planning at this point, but one thing was clear‚Äîhe needed to act. Quickly. Stealthily. Methodically. What would be his best approach...*


[12/9/2024 12:24 AM] Narration
Perhaps it was time to contact Paige once more..?


[12/9/2024 12:44 AM] Ghost
*So he did. Ghost looked left and right, ensuring he was safe to make the call. He leaned his back against the wall while staying crouched in the darkness. Placing his right index finger on the side of his head, he contacted Paige Underwood through his contacts. Damn, he even wrote down her surname?*

*He waited for her to respond. Time was ticking.*


[12/9/2024 12:51 AM] Narration
It did not ring for long...


[12/9/2024 12:51 AM] Paige
`Good, you're not flatlined... What's your situation?"` She asked.


[12/9/2024 12:54 AM] Ghost
`‚ÄúAlive, for now. Injured, but manageable. Low on ammo and energy‚Äîmight pass out soon. What‚Äôs your status? Picking me up, or should I keep moving?‚Äù`


[12/9/2024 1:01 AM] Paige
`Send me your geo. Can't be too close to the border walls. That's suicide for me. We need to find a safe place to link..`


[12/9/2024 1:05 AM] Ghost
*He pulled up the HUD, his eyes scanning the interface, moving left, right, up, and down. He sent his geo coordinates to Paige.*

`‚ÄúDone,‚Äù he replied. ‚ÄúFind me a quiet spot. I‚Äôll move out once I get the details.‚Äù`
# . . .
*For safety, he glanced over his shoulder, scanning the area once more for any suspicious movement.*


[12/9/2024 1:11 AM] Narration
Despite not seeing everything, Ghost could certainly tell that the area was swarming with lawmen and it was getting increasingly more dangerous every second time ticks.


[12/9/2024 1:11 AM] Paige
`You're too close to Fairview. Head South-West. There is an abandoned packaging facility a few blocks away. I'll send you the geo.`


[12/9/2024 1:11 AM] Narration
Within seconds, his interface was updated with the destination. If he was to hike his way, it would take 7 minutes at best.


[12/9/2024 1:15 AM] Ghost
*Hiking it was‚Äînot like he‚Äôd left a valuable vehicle behind. Clearly, he had to keep moving. Things would only get dicier if he stayed put. Without responding to Paige, he ended the call and began to make his way out.*


[12/9/2024 1:20 AM] Narration
Ghost traversed the dimly lit streets of Kapea. Evading the occasional patrol vehicle and dodging and foot traffic that stood between him and his destination.

Not a moment too soon and he came across what Paige described; an abandoned packaging facility with the rusted gate slightly ajar. Not a single light could be seen from the shipping yard that surrounded the building. Similarly to the gate, a single door was left slightly open.


[12/9/2024 1:25 AM] Ghost
*As Ghost approached the facility, his eyes scanned every detail, taking in the full picture. The slightly open door caught his attention, but caution dictated his move. He couldn‚Äôt afford to take any chances, even if the place appeared deserted.*

*Drawing his pistol in a steady grip, he advanced. Pressing himself against the wall beside the door, he used the tip of his boot to nudge it open further, widening the gap inch by inch. His posture remained tense, every muscle primed, as he prepared for whatever might be waiting on the other side‚Ä¶*


[12/9/2024 1:28 AM] Narration
A single bullet casing for a kinetic weapon bounced off the ground and rolled against the door.
Someone is inside.


[12/9/2024 1:28 AM] Paige
**"Hurry up and shut the door unless you want someone to see you entering the place!"** She said in an urgent, yet hushed tone.


[12/9/2024 1:34 AM] Narration
The blonde was not visible. Well-hidden behind a stack of steel beams that were abandoned. She stuck her hand out into the light which was provided by the lightning strike outside.


[12/9/2024 1:34 AM] Ghost
*He entered the facility, shutting the door firmly behind him. Ghost scanned his surroundings before turning his attention to Paige‚Äôs hand. How long had it been since their last meeting?*

*Regardless, he stepped toward her slowly. His body was smeared with blood‚Äînot just his own, but a grim mixture from his many victims. Chaos marked the path he had taken to get here. This was just the first step toward survival‚Äîor so he hoped.*


[12/9/2024 1:37 AM] Paige
She emerged and took in the sight of Ghost. **"The hell did you get your ass into? Picking fights with the CCR?"** Paige asked as she approached him. Examining him as she closed the distance.


[12/9/2024 1:44 AM] Ghost
*Ghost glanced to his right for a moment, giving the impression he wasn‚Äôt fully engaged, though he was.*

**‚ÄúThey were on me,‚Äù** *he replied in a rough, no-nonsense tone.* **‚ÄúHad to secure my gear. Discard traces. No other option.‚Äù**


[12/9/2024 5:20 AM] Paige
She closed the distance between the two of them. Grasping his forearm and bicep gently as she examined the obvious hole in his top. **"You've been shot."** She said out loud to herself.  It seems as if she is willing to tend to the wound but only if Ghost doesn't reject it...


[12/9/2024 8:34 AM] Ghost
*Ghost glanced down at the wound, his eyes briefly inspecting the damage.* **‚ÄúRight,‚Äù** *he muttered. Then, as soon as he allowed himself to relax, his body gave out, and he collapsed.*

*The adrenaline that had kept him going had finally worn off, leaving him unable to stay on his feet. Trusting that he was no longer in enemy territory, he‚Äôd let his guard down just enough to succumb to his exhaustion. Whatever Paige intended to do, she now had __full control__ of the situation‚Äîif she chose to act.*


[12/9/2024 9:01 AM] Paige
**"!?"** She wasn't expecting him to collapse so suddenly. In an attempt to keep him from falling she tries to hold him up a bit. Underestimating the weight of his being, she almost was dragged down completely.

Thankfully, with a bit of adjusting she saved them both from additional bruises. With Ghost now on the ground, it was now time to stabilize him.

With practice ease, she took a hold of an article of his clothing and ripped just enough to obtain two strips. Taking her knife she wrapped one at the top of the biceps and took her knife and began twisting it until it was tight. Using the second to secure the knife from unraveling.

**"I've done this one too many times..."** She muttered to herself.


[12/9/2024 9:07 AM] Ghost
*Ghost was on the verge of losing consciousness. His body had reached its limit long ago, and he had pushed himself far beyond. As his vision blurred and his awareness faded, he couldn‚Äôt register her words. Moments later, **his eyes closed.***


[12/9/2024 12:21 PM] Paige
**"Too bad Kode isn't here to deal with this... I'd dump this on him."** She complained as she jacked into Ghost's neural port. Gathering his vitals information. Her eyes illuminated, but then a secondary color came up... It was a call, from Cat!

**"Hey sis, how'd the gig go?"**
She said as she analyzed the data. Checking his body for any other injuries. Bruises, lacerations, and cuts were prominent.


[12/9/2024 12:22 PM] Cat Bayes
`Relatively smooth-smooth, but you know me.`
*Despite the argument they had back at the hideout, Cat sounded pretty happy to hear from her friend as well!*
`Hey, found something I need to talk to you and Mathias about, pretty big-big stuff, you free?`


[12/9/2024 12:26 PM] Paige
**"Sorta kinda... What you got?"** Ghost's vitals indicated he suffered from substantial blood loss. But nothing fatal. 
She made sure to snatch an IV kit from the hideout. It's a small thing, but it is better than nothing. Exposing his arm, she would undo the cap and begin poking his wrist.


[12/9/2024 12:29 PM] Cat Bayes
``Not-not something I can talk about over call, don't know who's listen-listening.`` *Well, that didn't sound ominous at all...*
``Need me to come to you?``


[12/9/2024 12:31 PM] Paige
**"That serious? Ok, right now I'm helping our new guy friend out... You don't have to come to me. I'll be back at our place in an hour tops."** Paige was now manually pumping the IV fluids. Listening out for any trouble from the outside.


[12/9/2024 12:32 PM] Paige
With the bleeding slowed, she could now bandage it up. She was far from being a paramedic, but being in Horizon meant you wore many hats.


[12/9/2024 12:38 PM] Paige
She was already turning down the volume of the call down by this time.**"Sure thing! See you soon."** She disconnected from the call and moved away from Ghost.  Not far away was a van that she borrowed from Digit's fleet. They would not suspect her to be driving one of these. Opening the back doors, she moved back towards Ghost and did her best to drag/carry him.

He is a lot heavier than he looks, she thought. But managed nonetheless to get him in the back and closed the doors. **"Mathias is going to kill me..."** She muttered.


[12/9/2024 12:39 PM] Narration
Without missing a beat, Paige toggled the overhead doors and hopped in the van, starting it and diligently driving back to safer parts.

Carlos pulled into the shipping yard where Gavyn's operations were managed. Last time Kaedues was here, there were just a few trucks that were docked. Now, the yard was crowded with them. Many of which were unmanned and dormant. A few yard workers lounged around some crates in the center, enjoying the easy-going day that was provided to them with the whole lockdown going on.

Carlos slowed down to the man door that led into the administrative offices at the facility grounds. Once in park, Carlos extended his fist towards Kaedues.


[12/13/2024 9:48 PM] Carlos
**"Alright amigo, take it easy out there."**


[12/13/2024 9:52 PM] KEADEUS STAUB
*He was unable to dodge the fist and sprawled out of control onto the concrete.*

[12/13/2024 9:53 PM] Kaedues Staub
**"I'll see you around,"** *he responds a little dismissively and taps his own fist to Carlos's. When he gets out of the car, he walks over to the main building he's familiar with... to find Gavyn.*


[12/13/2024 9:56 PM] Narration
Once Kaedues entered the building. He could see Gavyn walking down the hallway that he was greeted with. His back towards Kaedues and seemingly unaware of his entrance.


[12/13/2024 10:00 PM] Kaedues Staub
*Kaedues approaches Gavyn and calls out to make himself known before he scares the shit out of the guy.*
**"Thanks for having him drop by,"** *He says earnestly.*


[12/13/2024 10:07 PM] Gavyn
His head perked up at the sound of Kaedues' voice and did a waddling with his feet to turn his body towards the source in a timely manner. **"Oh, Caliber guy. Don't mention it. It is not like I am running around to do anything and I doubt Carlos had much to do himself."**


[12/13/2024 10:16 PM] Kaedues Staub
**"I understand. You ready to hand over the keys?"** *Kaedues asks and runs his fingers through his hair. He looks off to the side, and then back at Gavyn again.*

*The corners of Kaedues' mouth pinch.*
*(Don't know why, but the timing of the lockdown bugs me. Maybe it's just because of the other things I learned.)*

[12/13/2024 10:21 PM] Gavyn
**"Yeah, I have the keys..."** He began to pat his shirt down. **"...?"** He continued to shift around, leaning to one side to fish in his pockets. **"I could've sworn I had them.."** The next pocket. **"Ah, here we go."** He'd pull the keys out of his pocket and hold them out to Kaedues. **"Remember, I need it back before the end of the week. I guess this lockdown will end by then and when that happens, we'll be busier than...Well.. Yeah."**


[12/13/2024 10:25 PM] Kaedues Staub
**"I'll try to make the best of it. You're a big help,"** *Kaedues says and clasps the keys out of Gavyn's hand.*

**"I'm looking for avenues to work. Do you know anyone who would need jobs done at this kind of time, Gavyn?"** *Kaedues asks and pockets the keys.*


[12/13/2024 10:28 PM] Gavyn
**"I know a lot of people looking for help. Do you prefer them being local?"** Gavyn asked, reaching into his shirt pocket and pulling out a cereal bar.


[12/13/2024 10:30 PM] Kaedues Staub
**"Local? With Haven Heights in lockdown, aren't the local options the only ones?"**


[12/13/2024 10:35 PM] Gavyn
He took just about a 86.436% chunk out of the cereal bar and began chewing. After a few thoughtful chews, he shook his head. **"No, I have merchant credentials that allow me and two others to bypass restrictions."** A few more crunches. 
**"I got partners in __Monita__ that could use some extra hands stockpiling goods while we wait for the lockdown to end."** He pointed in the general direction where 'Monita' was. **"Imports and exports coming in and out of D9 come from there."**


[12/13/2024 10:38 PM] Kaedues Staub
**"I won't kick a gift car's radio,"** *He concedes.* **"I just came back from Fairview, and after that I am not excited to find work outside Haven Heights. I need the money though. Can I trust your guys in Monita to pay for my work?"**


[12/13/2024 10:41 PM] Gavyn
**"Of course, they handle the __important__ merchandis and well, everything in between. Hardly any funny business happens in Monita since it's always monitored."**


[12/13/2024 10:42 PM] Kaedues Staub
**"It's monitored... by who? The CCR?"**


[12/13/2024 10:44 PM] Gavyn
**"Mhm"** He nodded as he demolished the remainder of his bar.


[12/13/2024 10:46 PM] Kaedues Staub
*Kaedues nods with an understanding and pauses for a sec.* **"Where's the rig?"**


[12/14/2024 7:34 PM] Gavyn
While moving past Kaedues, Gavyn would lower his head and watch where his feet landed as he took each step before raising his gaze again. Taking him to the van, he guided him. **"It's at the back of the yard. I already had one of my employees start it just a short while ago so you should be able to just drive on out of here."**

When they approached the back door closest to the vehicle, Gavyn turned around and spoke to Kaedues again. Information regarding the tasks he referenced flooded Kaedues' eyes. Including the credentials needed for safe passage. **"I'm sending you the contact information and location where you should look first. You're looking for Hanson Greaves. The geo should direct you to his office on segment 319. It'll make sense once you get there."** He then opened the back door for Kaedues.


[12/14/2024 8:15 PM] Kaedues Staub
*Kaedues looks distantly towards the exit door, his attention shifting to that place only until Gavyn broke the quiet. He quickly absorbs the data the lumbering man sends him.* **"Hanson Greaves.."** *Kaedues nods and walks forward away from the man.* **"Thanks, Gavyn. Keep me posted if you need anything else done while I am loaning the van."**

*The work gofer steps into the morning light. In Kapea, a man can look up without having to worry about blindness from the sun. Kaedues never noticed until now, when he craned his neck backwards to loosen it. He stretches his legs one by one, lowering himself to press down on each of them.*

*Now, he stands and walks to the back of the yard. He keeps an eye out for any moving vehicles, even though the yard is quiet.*

[12/14/2024 8:56 PM] Narration
There were two smaller utility vehicles that were moving about the expansive lot in the back of the warehouse. Ferrying small crates and people from one end of the place to the other. Kaedues spotted a van along the back wall, isolated from the rest of the fleet vehicles that were parked. It was orange in color and appeared to have had better days. 

It was smaller in size compared to Kaedues' old set of wheels. The muffler was hanging on for dear life and the right headlight was flickering on and off. Why was it turning on and off when they should be off? No one knows. Could be the reason why the vehicle has to keep getting jumped to start?

A loud droning noise could be heard as Kaedues took in his surroundings. An CCR Photon Falcon was in a hurry towards the border of Kapea and Fairview. Flying at an extremely low altitude that would garner anyone's attention. Of course Kaedues' didn't do anything!

[12/14/2024 9:04 PM] Kaedues Staub
*Kaedues walks up to the van without a second thought. He takes a breath in and smells that intrusive mud stench, the kind that slowly fills his senses.*

*He looks up at the Photon Falcon and takes note of the gatling gun attached to it. It was only a few days ago that he was dancing around that thing's tracking software. Kaedues begins to think something more of substance, but a clouded feeling washes the would-be train of thought away.*

*The door feels dry and cold when Kaedues touches it. He opens it up and climbs into the driver's seat. Before he goes __anywhere__ with this vehicle, he climbs over the armrest into the loading bay to check for anything he should be curious or wary about.*


[12/14/2024 9:19 PM] Narration
The van's back was unremarkable. It had no windows, no special features, and no obvious signs of anything out of the ordinary. It was simply a plain, utilitarian vehicle. Inside, the loading bay was dimly lit and covered in scuff marks and scratches from years of heavy use. The floor was stained and littered with debris, and the walls were lined with dents and peeling paint patches. The air carried a musty scent with a metallic undertone that one could almost taste. Someone unscrewed the overhead light from the bay's roof and jerry-rigged an actual lightbulb to the wiring. Dirt and crud caked the lightbulb.

There was one crate that was nestled near the wheel well. It's lid was underneath the container and within it was a roll of paper towel. Nice!


[12/14/2024 9:36 PM] Kaedues Staub
*Kaedues breathes in. When the faint smell of rust comes along, Kaedues finds himself taking a little more of it in than he normally would. He shakes his head and climbs back into the driver seat. With a turn of the keys he was given, the car...*

*...does not start. Just gonna forget that happened and turn the key again. The car finally listens and sputters to... nothing. Kaedues feels something odd within his skull and his stomach as this wrist motion reminds the man of his old van.*

*He turns the key again. After hacking and coughing like a terminally ill patient who forgot to pay the life insurance bill, the van hums to life. Kaedues' head hangs forward and he lets out a sigh of relief.*
*(And this is how it behaves after it's jumpstarted..)*

*Without wasting time on another thought, Kaedues pulls out of Gavyn's shipping yard. He drives past the front and takes a mental note of the name of the facility Gavyn works at for future reference.*

The navigation required Kaedues to drive for roughly 54 minutes. Before the path takes him underground, he must follow the wall that separates Fairview and Haven Heights. Monita will be near him once he returns to the surface. 

The road he needed to take was a 2-way 8-lane road with very few opportunities to turn off the path. Long highway sections are blocked off by high walls. It was strange enough that once he got on the highway, he was the only vehicle traveling toward Monita. This would remain this way for the remainder of his first phase of travel...

*He plugs it in and listens to the song the drive selects to play. The shuffle settings were adjusted long ago.*

[12/15/2024 6:40 PM] Narration
The air was filled with sirens from emergency vehicles racing to their destinations throughout Kapea and the neighboring Littleton area. The night was brisk with the always-on-schedule acidic rain fall that forms practically every time the temperature drops. Mathias stood on a roof, binoculars in hand and foot up. He stabilized himself on the ledge as he surveyed the area.

His vantage point was an old news station whose roof was crumbling. It experienced a CCR raid a few times in its lifetime. Bullet holes dotted what was left of the infrastructure, along with spent shell casings and old hardware that had eroded from the elements. The surrounding buildings were in disrepair, their facades marred by graffiti and crumbling brickwork. Windows were either shattered or boarded up, and the occasional flicker of a faulty neon sign cast eerie shadows across the deserted streets below.

Cole climbed from the building back. Using an abandoned ladder Mathias set up moments earlier. Each rung creaked ominously under Cole's weight as if protesting the intrusion.


[12/15/2024 6:53 PM] Ghost
*Ghost wasn‚Äôt bothered by the creaking, unstable ladder‚Äîit was the condition he was in that weighed on him. Recovering from his injuries, low on ammo, and without the gear he was used to, it wasn‚Äôt ideal. All he had was a handgun, a few magazines, and a knife. He had seen better days and better equipment. **But it would have to do.** He focused on the task at hand and continued climbing the ladder, step by step, until he reached the rooftop.*

*A moment later, he spotted Mathias. Ghost walked over to him, his footsteps slicing through the silence, the sound of his boots splashing in the rain-soaked puddles.*


[12/15/2024 7:10 PM] Mathias
Mathias regarded him with a low grunt. Shifting his weight and swiveling his binoculars to the left. **"General area is contested. Seen two patrols drive through here. The night before was a Hot Zone so I would consider this a sign they thoroughly searched the place." **

Lowering his binoculars, Mathias peered to his right where Ghost was now situated. **"Most structures around here are fragged. Got my eyes on two POIs."** He mentioned, pointing into the distance. **"There is an old factory tucked away between two collapsed buildings. Looks relatively untouched, besides a lot of bullet holes, a couple of the windows, and the front gate is busted in. Nothing that cannot be patched."**

Pointing again, he said, **"Second point. A ways down from us, is a bank. Not a big one. If I had to take a guess, it was a local joint. It's been picked dry for materials. They busted through their vault and emptied whatever was inside. No vehicles around there, and I don't see anyone going in or out. Question is, which one you want to look at first?"**


[12/15/2024 7:27 PM] Ghost
*Ghost grunted, his gaze sharp as he analyzed the options.* **"Old factory‚Äôs the better bet. It‚Äôs tucked away, doesn‚Äôt scream attention. The damage can be patched up‚Äînothing major."**

*He glanced at the bank, his tone low and blunt.* **"The bank‚Äôs a liability. It‚Äôs a local target, still too much noise. Don‚Äôt need that kind of heat."**


[12/15/2024 7:54 PM] Mathias
He would open his jacket, pushing the binoculars into an internal pocket. In reference to the old factory, **"Alright, let's go."** So he said. Mathias stepped off the roof which stood three stories tall and landed on the asphalt parking area of the news station on both feet. On his way to the factory, he continued to look left and right as he made his way across the lot.


[12/15/2024 8:03 PM] Ghost
*Ghost followed Mathias' lead but opted for the safer route. Rather than risk any potential injuries from the drop, he descended the unstable ladder carefully. He moved quickly, taking the long way around the building to catch up. As he crossed the lot, his eyes flicked left and right, scanning for any signs of movement. There was no visible reaction from Ghost. His expression was unreadable behind the mask, and the effortless way Mathias had dropped three stories didn‚Äôt even register as impressive‚Äî**at least not outwardly.***


[12/15/2024 8:32 PM] Narration
The two strategically navigated to the factory. Each turn they made was methodical and prioritized security versus mobility. It only took them a few minutes to reach their destination and when they did, Cole and Mathias slinked their way through the torn down front gates and forced open a barred door that separated the factory for the rest of the world.

 Inside, the factory was a dimly lit labyrinth of rusted machinery and tangled wires, casting eerie shadows on the cracked concrete floors. The air was thick with the smell of oil and dust, and the distant hum of malfunctioning equipment echoed throughout the cavernous space.


[12/15/2024 8:32 PM] Mathias
**"Hmm."** He hummed to himself, aligning him with one wall as he pushed further into the factory. His arms swaying as he walked tactfully.

[12/15/2024 8:39 PM] Ghost
*Ghost had his handgun drawn, his trusted companion in hand. He surveyed the surroundings with a soldier's focus, absorbing every detail of the environment as if he were instinctively attuning himself to the space. Each step was measured, every corner studied. He moved cautiously and methodically, keeping pace with Mathias. His senses were sharp...*


[12/15/2024 9:07 PM] Mathias
**"Split up, I'll take the skywalk, sweep the rest of this floor."** He'd say quietly. Though, his gruff voice despite speaking in a near whisper carried a great deal of bass with it.


[12/15/2024 9:13 PM] Ghost
*Ghost gave a silent nod, watching Mathias split off. His focus shifted immediately to his surroundings, his gaze narrowing as he assessed the area. His handgun was ready, and his attention poised!*


[12/15/2024 9:24 PM] Narration
He felt the chill of damp air seeping through his cloak, carrying the scent of rust and decay. The faint echo of dripping water punctuated the silence. Ahead of him, a gaping hole in the stone floor revealed a maze of large twisted metal pipes below, their surfaces slick with moisture. The pipes disappeared into darkness, hinting at a labyrinthine network far beyond his reach. One could fall in and hurt themselves if they did not descend carefully.

 Just past the edge of the hole, a set of double doors stood slightly ajar, A faint blue light spilled from the gap, bathing the damp ground in an eerie glow and inviting him to explore the secrets beyond. The light pulsed rhythmically, beckoning him to uncover what lay behind the mysterious doors...

 To his left, another section of the factory came into view, its walls lined with rusted machinery that had long been abandoned. Broken conveyor belts hung limply, and shattered windows allowed the moonlight to cast ghostly patterns on the floor. There was so much machinery it was a whole other part of the factory!


[12/15/2024 9:33 PM] Ghost
*It was clear where Ghost's focus lay. He couldn‚Äôt afford to overlook this. While the left side of the factory offered much to explore, he couldn‚Äôt risk wasting time‚Äîthere was always the chance he'd miss something important.*

*With that thought in mind, he pressed on toward the double doors. Carefully avoiding the **gaping** hole. His handgun remained steady, his grip firm. Each step was slow, deliberate, and calculated. The faintest sound of his footsteps barely echoed in the vast space. He wasn‚Äôt sure how long his 'partner' would take, but Ghost wasn't about to wait idly. Taking the initiative, he continued his investigation.*


[12/15/2024 9:38 PM] Narration
Beyond the doors, Ghost found himself in a dimly lit electrical room. Large generators stood quietly, dominating the space. A soft glow emanated from a solitary computer terminal, casting flickering shadows across the room. It was clear that this was the nerve center of the factory's power supply.


[12/15/2024 9:54 PM] Ghost
*Interesting, a solitary computer terminal, you say? Before Ghost even considered approaching it, he surveyed the room‚Äîevery corner, every nook and cranny. He couldn't afford to be careless. He wouldn‚Äôt rest until he was certain the place was **secure.***

*He methodically pointed the muzzle of his handgun around the room, taking his time. Once it was clear, he moved towards the terminal. What exactly was he looking at?*


[12/15/2024 9:57 PM] Narration
It was looking at a power terminal. It's sole purpose was to control the functions of the power regulation within the plant. Sadly, it was throwing error code faster than Ghost could humanly process. If they were to use this place,  they'd need to get power working again.


[12/15/2024 10:04 PM] Ghost
*Ghost made a mental note. He recalled a netrunner who had helped during the CCR clash, back when he was running with Paige. Her name escaped him‚Äîhe wasn't one for remembering names unless they belonged to high-profile targets‚Äîbut he distinctly remembered the short circuit he'd endured.*

*He shook off the thought and turned around, scanning the room. Was there anything else of importance before he headed back? He needed to be thorough before making his move.*


[12/15/2024 10:35 PM] Narration
As Ghost scanned the rest of the room's interior, he would come across nothing of much interes‚Äî Were those footprints? Large rope like tracks were left in the form of dried mud covering the floor around the back and they led out into the rest of the factory. Where Ghostgaze came from. 

Was someone being dragged?


[12/15/2024 10:40 PM] Ghost
*Ghost quickly picked up on the tracks, his eyes narrowing even further as his grip on the handgun tightened. Moving cautiously, he began to follow the trail, his sharp gaze scanning every corner of the room and beyond. Was there someone else here besides the two of them? There was only one way to find out.*


[12/15/2024 10:44 PM] Narration
Ghost followed the trail leading out of the generator room. They continued moving towards the gap until they ended. They must've been thrown off the ledge into the hole.


[12/15/2024 10:54 PM] Ghost
*Ghost moved closer to the hole, his steps deliberate and silent. He stopped at the edge, peering down into the pitch-black void below. Reaching for the flashlight clipped to his tactical belt, he unholstered it with a swift motion. A quick click, and the beam of light sliced through the oppressive darkness.*

*What the light revealed made him pause...*


[12/15/2024 10:57 PM] Narration
The flashlight easily illuminated its destination. At the bottom of the large hole was a small pool of acidic green water that collected since it was the lowest point. Along the edges were large pipes that vanished into the ground and underneath the rest of the factory. From his angle, he wouldn't be able to peer into the pipes unless he descended into the hole.


[12/15/2024 11:06 PM] Ghost
*Ghost couldn‚Äôt let this go unanswered. Ignoring it would gnaw at him, a loose thread he couldn‚Äôt leave untied. His gaze swept the room, scanning for anything that might help him descend safely. A sturdy rope, a ladder, or even a beam to secure a line‚Äîanything that could prevent a reckless drop into the acidic pool below. His flashlight traced the edges of the hole, searching for a potential landing spot that could break his fall. Whatever lay at the bottom demanded answers, __and Ghost wasn‚Äôt one to walk away.__*


[12/15/2024 11:10 PM] Narration
There was several trusses that protruded from rubble around him could allow Ghost to latch onto and descend relatively safely onto large chunks of concrete that would be seen as platforms going all the way down.


[12/15/2024 11:11 PM] Ghost
*Holstering his flashlight temporarily, Ghost tested the nearest truss with a firm tug, ensuring it could bear his weight.*


[12/15/2024 11:13 PM] Narration
The truss, despite its rusted appearance were sturdy.


[12/15/2024 11:14 PM] Ghost
*Satisfied, he prepared to climb down, methodically moving from one support to the next, his boots steady against the uneven metal and concrete.*


[12/15/2024 11:17 PM] Narration
As Ghost descended, the truss groaned. However, it supported on until he reached the shore of the acidic pool.


[12/15/2024 11:20 PM] Ghost
*Finally, his boots met the damp, cracked concrete at the shore of the acidic pool. Ghost scanned the area, using his flashlight once more as he unholstered his handgun.*


[12/17/2024 7:04 PM] Narration
Ghost shifted the focal point of his torch, the light scrapping across the rough walls of mixed concrete, rebar, and mud. It was when his light came across one of the pipe when it started to get interesting. These pipes were much larger up close. The apex of it had green moss, draping down to nearly the entire height. Between the gaps of these mossy plants was the length of the pipe. The same acidic water rested at the bottom of the pipe, the walls were rusted and chipping from years of abandonment. At the end of the seemed to be was an elbow bend which led to who knows where. In fact, each pipe that Ghost shined his flashlight towards had a similar design. Each rusted and leading to something underground. There were __four__ pipes. Two to his left, one to his right, and one dead-ahead...


[12/17/2024 7:17 PM] Ghost
*Too many options, too many chances to go wrong. Ghost had to make a choice‚Äîjust one, for now. He opted to move straight ahead, his handgun steady and trained on the darkness before him.*


[12/21/2024 8:47 PM] Narration
Ghost approached the pipe in the center. Upon getting closer to the mouth of the void, he could have noticed the additional discharge of the acidic water running off the lip of the pipe. Nothing too alarming considering what he has been through, right?

His flashlight periced into the darkness. Within 15 feet, the pipe makes a bend to the right, the direction in which this water is running from. Flora grew along the pipe's hull, strange in its nature. It was not everyday you've seen plant life and yet in the center of an concrete jungle bore plant-life, despite being scarce it could come off as an oddity considering the more than believable toxic waste flowing through. 

His boots sloshed through the water. As his footwear broke the surface of the greenish liquid, much darker green sluge was surfaced and pushed about as he made his way towards the bend. Yuck.


[12/21/2024 8:59 PM] Ghost
*He didn‚Äôt have much of a choice but to keep moving. He had come this far‚Äîthere was no turning back now. His guard remained steady, fully aware of the dangers this rough environment posed. Any engagement here could be catastrophic, especially given the fact that he was still recovering from recent injuries, a factor he couldn‚Äôt afford to ignore.

As Ghost approached the bend, he adjusted his posture, lowering himself carefully to avoid hitting his head. The situation was far from ideal, but it wasn‚Äôt enough to faze him. He had endured far worse throughout his career, and this was just another obstacle to overcome. As for the plant life, he completely disregarded it, not the type of person to be swayed by something like that.*


[12/21/2024 9:30 PM] Narration
Ghost neared the bend, unassuming one would call it. It was just a bend in the pipe right? No, it was not just a bend in the pipe. The very moment Ghost turned the corner, the tunnel went deep. But not deep enough to obscure the monstrosity that he was to face.

Before him was some kind of monster. A monster that not even he has seen before, feasting off of the flesh of an asunder body of a person. A body that could not be recognized beyond simple shapes, and what was left by the creature for later. Ghost was quiet which helped him go unnoticed by the creature. However, the intensity of his flashlight was enough for the creature to shift its body around to face the source. It's movements were like nothing he had seen before. It was quick and agile as it screeched in surprise. Its long appendages powering the creature back into the darkness. Massive amounts of blood poured down its maw. It's red eyes were the last Ghost was able to see until the distance of his light could no longer maintain visual of the creature; It vanished in the darkness. The remains of the once person was all that remained.

Just great, now we got monsters too?

[12/21/2024 9:50 PM] Ghost
-# **Stay cool. Stay cool. Stay cool. Stay cool. Stay cool. Stay cool. Stay cool. Stay cool. Stay cool. Stay cool. Stay cool. Stay cool. Stay cool. Stay cool. Stay cool. Stay cool. Stay cool. Stay cool. Stay cool. Stay cool. Stay cool. Stay cool. Stay cool. Stay cool.**

*Without his mask on, this is exactly what you would‚Äôve heard him muttering to himself‚Äîover and over. His grip tightened on his handgun, and his eyes narrowed into sharp slits. Anyone else in this situation would have been asking, What the fuck was that? But Ghost? He was already thinking ahead. His main concern now was how to even fight this thing. He had never faced anything like it before, and the thought alone pissed him off. **Think, Ghost. Think!***

*He pressed his back against the wall just before the bend, using it as cover for the moment. Though the creature was out of sight, it didn‚Äôt mean the threat was gone. He killed his flashlight and began analyzing the situation. Injured, lightly armed, stuck in uncharted territory with a monster lurking nearby‚Ä¶ Yeah, it couldn‚Äôt get much worse than this. Can it?*

*After a brief moment of deliberation, Ghost decided to retreat. Reporting this to Mathias was the first step. Who knows how many of those things were lurking down here?!*


[12/21/2024 10:39 PM] Narration
Ghost returned back out into the factory. Despite the low level of light, it was far more than what he had back in that tunnel. He could still hear that __thing__ moving about somewhere underneath the facility, bumping and thumping around as it navigated the large network of tunnels.


[12/21/2024 10:39 PM] Mathias
Mathias was at the top of the hole, looking down just as Ghost emerged from the depths of the void. He furrowed his brow and crouched down by the edge. Seemingly unaware of what was going on. **"Skywalk is clear, find anything?"** He asked.


[12/21/2024 10:53 PM] Ghost
*Ghost emerged from the gaping hole as quickly as possible, knowing he couldn‚Äôt afford to waste another second down there.*

*He walked past Mathias, placing a hand on a nearby wall to steady himself as he took a moment to catch his breath. After what felt like a minute of silence, he turned to face Mathias, his hands resting on his hips. **For another minute**, he simply stared at him, the faint sounds of that thing echoing from the depths below.*

*Finally, in his deep, steady voice, he broke the silence with a simple question‚Ä¶* **‚ÄúYeah. Do we have explosives?‚Äù**


[12/21/2024 10:58 PM] Mathias
Mathias would reach into his trench coat and pull out a grenade. It was an simple impact grenade. He'd toss it down towards Ghost. **"Only one I got."**


[12/21/2024 11:03 PM] Ghost
*Ghost caught the impact grenade with ease, his handgun already holstered. He gave it a quick inspection, turning it over in his hands before nodding to Mathias.* **‚ÄúThat‚Äôll do. Give me a moment.‚Äù**

*Without hesitation, he headed back down into the depths, clearly intent on __finishing__ whatever business he had.*


[12/22/2024 9:51 PM] Mathias
Mathias watched as Ghost returned into the tunnel network. He was curious on the inside, but not curious enough to try to ask. With a heavy sigh, Mathias stood up. Using the same path Ghost used to traverse down into the hole.


[12/22/2024 9:51 PM] Narration
Ghost returned to where he last seen that abomination and came to find out that it was still somewhere deep within the tunnel network. Once more, he would come across the remains of a person, their blood was mostly drained into the greenish water.


[12/22/2024 9:57 PM] Ghost
*It wasn‚Äôt much of a stretch to assume this was the monster‚Äôs hunting ground, but Ghost wasn‚Äôt about to let himself become its prey.*

*He glanced at the impact grenade in his hand, then back at the unfortunate victim. The thought crossed his mind‚Äîthe beast could be anywhere by now, moving far faster than he ever could. Still, he had an idea. It wasn‚Äôt a guarantee, but it was something.*

*Ghost crouched down near the remains of the victim, moving quietly. He scanned the grotesque mess, searching for any limbs that might still be intact.*


[12/22/2024 10:07 PM] Narration
Every limb was mangled. The most intact part of this person's body was a severed hand but three of its 5 fingers were severed at different parts of the knuckle joints. Thick leather indicated they wore a coat, but they were reduced to leather scraps...


[12/22/2024 10:22 PM] Ghost
*Ghost wasn‚Äôt particularly bothered by the scene in front of him. In fact, he gently grabbed the severed hand, lifting it up to inspect it closely at eye level. He wiggled it around playfully before deciding to use it as bait.

If his hunch was correct, the monster was attracted to the smell of blood. And if this was its food, then surely it wouldn‚Äôt leave its meal unfinished.

He looked around for a suitable spot to place the hand, preferably further away from the corpse. Ghost holstered his impact grenade into one of his empty pouches and unholstered his handgun, all while holding the severed hand in his left hand. What lay ahead of him? Would he need to turn on his flashlight again?*


[12/23/2024 9:37 PM] gardengnostic2
he'll be fine


[12/24/2024 2:15 PM] Narration
With no light sources, Ghost will be forced to turn his flashlight back on to reliably traverse the unknown.

Considering the lack of light and that,*thing's* ability to navigate in near to 0 visibility suggests that it can see in the darkness.


[12/24/2024 3:16 PM] Ghost
*It was clear to Ghost that turning his flashlight back on could very likely betray his position, but the narrator might also be right.*

*It was‚Ä¶ what do you call it? A double-edged sword situation. He was already in deep trouble, so making things more difficult for himself would only create more obstacles.*

*With a smooth motion, he pulled out his flashlight, flicking the switch and illuminating the path ahead. All he needed to do now was find a spot far enough from the mangled corpse to place the bait.*


[12/24/2024 7:03 PM] Narration
Ghost ventured further into the abyss which was a large labyrinth of pipes leading each other's way with no real sense of direction. This continued for a few minutes until he came across an underground opening as the walls suddenly jutted outwards. The air was damp and cool, filled with the echoing roar of cascading water. A mist hung in the air, diffusing the dim glow of his flashlight and casting eerie shadows against the moss-covered walls.

Just in front of him was a canal with rusted railings separating him from the rapid water flow vanishing to his left. They all led to here in one way or another, huh? The remnants of an old, forgotten water treatment facility sprawled before him, its machinery long silent and coated with grime. Crumbling brickwork and corroded metal beams stood silent. Rusted gears and broken valves lay scattered across the concrete floor.


[12/24/2024 7:04 PM] Narration
A distant yet pronounced screech came from somewhere deep within the tunnel network. The creature was still agitated by Ghost's earlier appearance.


[12/24/2024 7:16 PM] Ghost
*To think this was the result of his earlier decision‚Ä¶ If Ghost had known what lay ahead, avoiding all this trouble would‚Äôve been an appealing alternative. Perhaps heading to the bank would‚Äôve been the smarter choice. His flashlight, weakened and diffused by the mist, offered little comfort‚Äîespecially against a monster he knew **almost nothing** about.*

*Even for someone like Ghost, this was overwhelming. Fighting people, even the likes of him, was one thing. But facing an actual monster? That was something entirely different.*

*Still, he pressed on, carefully scanning his surroundings, or at least what he could make out through the dim glow of his flashlight. The faint flicker of the beam reminded him of how little time he had before the battery gave out. In his other hand, he still clutched the severed bait, his grip tightening around it. Now the question remained: __where to place it?__*


[12/24/2024 8:55 PM] Ghost
*And that‚Äôs when he made his decision. Ghost placed the bait near the edge of the canal, where the scent of blood could be carried downstream. With this, he hoped to lure the creature away from his position, at least for the moment.*

*All he needed was one good throw while the monster was in plain sight and preoccupied. Though the severed hand was a meager snack for that beast, it might be enough to buy him a short window of opportunity.*

*Once the bait was in place, Ghost swiftly moved to hide behind one of the broken valves scattered around the area, keeping his weapon and impact grenade ready.*


[12/24/2024 9:05 PM] Narration
Ghost was now playing the waiting game with this thing. Where it would come from was a toss-up considering he could easily be flanked if he was not diligent. It was a larger creature so stealth certainly could not be its forte.


[12/24/2024 9:12 PM] Narration
The low and slow sound of something dragging could be heard reverberating into the space. The creature's massive, slick body slithered across the damp floor, leaving a trail of muck in its wake. As it moved closer to the shadows, the air filled with the pungent scent of stagnant water and decay.

It was unaware of Ghost's presence at the time. Priority was given to the scent of blood that emanated from the severed hand along the bank of the underground canal. Its rotting teeth were jagged and uneven, remnants of past battles and meals that left them chipped and stained. However, they were still capable of tearing through flesh easily. The creature's tentacle-like appendages writhed and twisted, able to grab and drag anything and anyone into darkness. These appendages moved with an unsettling grace, allowing its body to smoothly coast against the ground. 

 As it approached the severed hand, the creature paused for a moment, its nostrils flaring as it savored the scent of fresh blood. One of its appendages reached out with deliberate precision, wrapping around the hand with a gentle yet firm grip. It brought the hand closer, examining it briefly before engulfing it with its massive maw, a low, satisfied growl rumbling from deep within its throat.


[12/24/2024 9:23 PM] Ghost
*Ghost could hear the creature clearly, its movements and guttural sounds echoing through the damp air. He wasn‚Äôt far from it, but he understood that even a single mistake could cost him his life. The monster‚Äôs speed was still an unknown factor, and running could very well be a futile effort in this situation.*

*Despite the tension, Ghost stepped out of his hiding spot and launched the impact grenade. Though visibility was poor, he relied on his vivid recollection of where he had placed the bait. His throw was deliberate, his movements smooth, every muscle in his body focused on this critical moment. It was all up to chance now‚Ä¶ a desperate **gamble**‚Ä¶*

[12/24/2024 9:29 PM] Narration
The grenade exploded with a deafening roar, sending shrapnel and debris flying in all directions. The creature let out a piercing screech as the force of the blast tore through its slimy flesh, leaving a gaping wounds that oozed dark, viscous fluid. Its victim's body parts are now visible in its large sack-like stomach. Its tentacle-like appendages writhed in agony, convulsing violently as it thrashed against the ground. 

 The creature, driven by instinct to escape, attempted to retreat from the source of its pain. Its appendages flailed wildly, desperately seeking purchase on the slick ground, but its injuries made coordination impossible. As it struggled, its massive form slipped over the edge of the bank and plunged into the dark waters of the canal below. It's body halfway submerged as it died.


[12/24/2024 9:40 PM] Ghost
*For a brief moment, Ghost dropped to his knees, breathing heavily. He removed his mask, and then‚Ä¶*


[12/24/2024 9:40 PM] Cole Mercer
*Cole looked at his hands, noticing they were trembling, not uncontrollably, but subtly.*
-# *He thought to himself,* **‚ÄúWhat‚Ä¶ the fuck was that‚Ä¶?‚Äù** *His breathing remained heavy as he tried to steady himself.*
*If it hadn‚Äôt been for Mathias, Cole knew he would probably be dead down here. His mask was clutched tightly in his left hand, and he stared at it for a brief moment. Now that he thought about it, it had been a long time since he removed his disguise during a mission. If there were a mirror nearby, it would reveal the exhaustion etched across his face. Encountering a monster like that was the last thing he‚Äôd expected‚Ä¶*


[12/24/2024 10:03 PM] Narration
A flashlight illuminated from behind Cole. Someone got behind him silently..


[12/24/2024 10:06 PM] Cole Mercer
*After what felt like a minute or two, Cole got back on his feet and put the mask back on, just as something illuminated in his direction.*


[12/24/2024 10:06 PM] Ghost
*He unholstered his weapon and snapped his flashlight into position, both aimed sharply at the source of the light ahead.*


[12/24/2024 10:17 PM] Mathias
It was Mathias striding into the area. His attention was devoted to the beast beyond Ghost. He walked past him and towards the canal. **"So this is what got you glitchin'."**


[12/24/2024 10:20 PM] Ghost
*Unlike his behavior before putting the mask back on, Ghost was now completely stoic. He lowered his handgun as soon as he realized it was Mathias.*

*Looking down the canal, he replied nonchalantly,* **‚ÄúSeen one of those before?‚Äù**


[12/24/2024 10:29 PM] Mathias
**"Mmn, Purafish."** He would state as he shone the light down into the canal. **"You wouldn't see one of these in a locked down city... Unless."** He pointed his light up towards the cascading water. **"There is a unsupervised outlet."**


[12/24/2024 10:37 PM] Ghost
*Ghost made a mental note of the term ‚ÄòPurafish‚Äô before his attention shifted to Mathias‚Äô last line.* **‚ÄúPlace seems unsupervised,‚Äù** *he replied.* **‚ÄúNo surprise.‚Äù**


[12/24/2024 10:43 PM] Mathias
**"Purafish don't magically manifest in dense areas. Its worth investigating this treatment facility and its inlets further, on a later date."**


[12/24/2024 10:45 PM] Mathias
Mathias then stepped away from the canal and started to head back. **"The factory is clear."**


[12/24/2024 10:47 PM] Ghost
*Ghost absorbed all the information and nodded. He then followed suit, glancing back one last time before finally turning in the direction they came from.*


[12/24/2024 11:01 PM] Mathias
**"This factory is rough, but that is how we have operated for a long time. Still not vibing with the bank?"** He asked as they walked.


[12/24/2024 11:05 PM] Ghost
**‚ÄúWe can still check it out if you‚Äôre up for it.‚Äù** *Ghost replied, his tone sharp and straightforward.*


[12/24/2024 11:06 PM] Mathias
**"Fine by me."**


[12/24/2024 11:07 PM] Ghost
**‚ÄùLet‚Äôs move.‚Äù**


[1/1/2025 10:49 PM] Narration
Ghost and Mathias reemerged in the streets of Kapea. The rain had worsened since they delved into the factory, creating a symphony of destructive cadences. The lights that lined the streets reflected off of the puddles of rain, brightening and distorting the area around them. Headlights were more sensitive to the naked eye. With the downpour, the pair could move more hastily without drawing attention to their movements. 

Vaulting over pallets, shipping containers, and fence brought the two to the side of the abandoned bank Mathias scouted earlier in the night. The lot was in terrible condition, deep cracks and grooves made up sophisticated patterns throughout the entire area. Parts of the lot had sunken into the ground, created by dangerous sink that is desperate to claim the surface above. 

Mathias moved underneath the where vehicles could drive up to kiosks for transactions. Numerous signs were posted along the columns that supported the structure the canopy. One of the now-ruined printed signs mentioned the 'pound,' possibly referring to the discontinuation of the currency or related.


[1/2/2025 8:57 AM] Ghost
*Ghost followed closely behind Mathias, trusting his lead. After all, Mathias had marked these locations for investigation, and it would be unwise for Ghost to move without caution or a clear sense of direction. His eyes briefly flicked to the worn sign, noting the reference to ‚Äòpound‚Äô. With a quick glance back to the path ahead, he caught up to Mathias, staying just a step behind. His handgun was at the ready, steady in his grip as he waited for Mathias‚Äô signal.*


[1/3/2025 7:56 PM] Mathias
With one hand, Mathias pushed on the side door. The frame was bent and twisted, making any forceful entry difficult without explosives. However, it was no immediate issue for the veteran as with a grunt and a flex of his left arm, the door began groaning in protest and soon peeled enough for him to get his large frame through. His head looked left and right, making sure that it was indeed clear. Once satisfied with his initial sweep, he began moving left down the hall of this dilapidated bank.

[1/3/2025 8:22 PM] Ghost
*For a brief moment, Ghost stood motionless outside the door after Mathias entered. He was processing what he had just witnessed, standing silent and unmoving as if frozen in thought. Thirty seconds passed before he shook his head, snapping back to reality...*

*Without hesitation, he moved in, following Mathias‚Äô lead. His handgun was trained on each corner as he cleared them methodically before shifting his focus to the hallway on the left, where Mathias had gone.*

[1/3/2025 9:00 PM] Mathias
He could be seen in what could be made out as the manager's office through the open double glass doors. The glass long shattered and the office was in ruin. Most of the furniture had already been scavenged and all that was seemingly left was the large table that could not be moved without some sort of vehicle. He picked up a ruined notepad made of paper. Near instant did it fall apart and the section that did fall turned into a thin dust. **"...?"** He continued looking around the office.


[1/3/2025 9:00 PM] Narration
The hallway was short, with Mathias just down the hall there was another bend to the hallway just before the manager's office that led somewhere deeper into the building. To Ghost's right was the teller's room (Section which employees would interact with those pulling up to the banking kiosk outside.)


[1/3/2025 9:03 PM] Ghost
*Another bend down the hallway? That was something the two could explore later, hopefully without any grotesque mutant fish appearing out of nowhere... For now, Ghost decided to check out the teller's room. It was a start, at least. He cautiously made his way inside, moving slowly but deliberately.*


[1/3/2025 9:12 PM] Narration
Ghost entered the teller's room. Similarly to the manager's office down the hall, the state of the room was unremarkable. The chairs have all been removed from here and the only reason why the desks remain is because they are built into the wall. Wait, no, a section was removed by someone at some given time. Old equipment that was unfamiliar to Ghost were still present, although few. Some sort of thin device with a black surface, glass that was chipped in several places and underneath the glass was fogged. An rusted aluminum frame made up its body. At the top of this device was a small pin-like hole, two of them in-fact. Above all those layers was dust, lots and lots of dust. What kind of device was this?

It was beside a set of hardware keys. These were rare to find but still used. In the far corner was a safe that was opened. Webs made up the contents...


[1/3/2025 9:16 PM] Ghost
*Ghost moved cautiously around the room; in unfamiliar places, you could never be too careful. His head shifted left and right as he scanned the area, his sharp gaze taking in every detail. Then, his eyes landed on the strange device and the dust-covered, open safe. His first priority was **the device**. What exactly was he dealing with here?*


[1/3/2025 9:18 PM] Narration
Who knows? He could go online using his neural deck to do a object search...


[1/3/2025 9:20 PM] Ghost
*Ghost tilted his head slightly, letting out a small breath as he activated his neural deck. A faint, almost imperceptible hum filled his ears as the system came online, linking to his internal HUD. With a quick glance, he locked onto the strange device and **initiated** an object search.*


[1/3/2025 9:23 PM] Narration
There were only 1 entry regarding this device; A smartphone. A obscured forum link is where it originated from, antique as it dates back to **2031**. It did some of the basic functions of what his own neural deck could do. Calls, messages and basic computing. Nothing that holds a candle to anything this day and age...

[1/3/2025 9:28 PM] Ghost
*He raised his right eyebrow in curiosity, though it wasn‚Äôt visible. Since this outdated piece of tech had been lying dormant on the table for so long, he figured he might as well take it. Finders keepers, after all. He snatched it up and tucked it into his pocket, zipping it shut to prevent it from falling out. Why he chose to take it... who knows.*

*Moving on, his gaze shifted to the open safe. He approached slowly, lowering himself to scan it carefully.*


[1/3/2025 10:07 PM] Narration
The safe was empty, except being the home for multiple generations of spiders who acquired the space. Countless sacs and spiders remained still within the safe. The webbing too thick to see the back of the safe.


[1/4/2025 11:45 AM] Ghost
*Ghost sighed, taking a mental note of the safe‚Äôs condition. The spiders had claimed this space long before him... it would feel unjust to disturb their work just to inspect an empty safe. He briefly considered using his knife but decided against it. There was no point. For now, he chose to leave it undisturbed. Turning away, he retraced his steps, moving slowly and deliberately as he headed back to link up with Mathias.*


[1/4/2025 1:08 PM] Narration
Ghost returned to the hallway where Mathias was last seen and thankfully he was still present in the office. In fact, he was just exiting the room and linked up with Ghost.


[1/4/2025 1:08 PM] Mathias
**"There is a underground vault room."** He stated, the hallway that was unseen opened up to a general employee lounge. The door to their right was ripped down, exposing the front lobby of the ruined bank. Just a bit further and to the left was a large vault door that was slightly ajar. Mathias pulled the huge circular vault door so that it could be accessed by the two of them.


[1/4/2025 1:14 PM] Ghost
**"Nothing much on my end."** *Ghost said as he followed Mathias, aiming his flashlight to provide additional illumination. He periodically scanned their surroundings, his head swiveling to ensure no one was lying in wait to ambush them. His other hand rested lightly on his holster, ready to draw if necessary.*


[1/4/2025 1:22 PM] Narration
The vault door led to steps that disappeared into the darkness below. This place has not seen power in ages. Mathias was the first to go down.


[1/4/2025 1:22 PM] Mathias
**"Picked clean by scavengers... Doubt this place is of any use to us. Too small and too many openings."** He continued to descend.


[1/4/2025 1:41 PM] Ghost
*As usual, Ghost followed Mathias‚Äô lead, staying a few steps behind and keeping an eye on their rear. His handgun was unholstered, flashlight positioned beneath it like a makeshift attachment.* **‚ÄúWe‚Äôll decide once the area is secure.‚Äù** *he said, his tone calm and measured.*


[1/4/2025 4:50 PM] Narration
As they reached the bottom, they encountered another vault door. Something literally tore this one off its foundation. Several thin pieces of paper were caked onto the ground and became one with the surface. Breathing seemed difficult due to the stale air. This place has not been visited for a long time... Dust blanketed the floors and walls, with cobwebs hanging from the ceiling like delicate curtains. Broken shelves lined the sides, their contents scattered and forgotten. In the corner, a rusted metal chair lay overturned, its legs twisted and bent. 

 Piled in disarray on what remained of a table were stacks of old currency, their edges frayed and yellowed with age. The faded bills were bundled together with brittle rubber bands, some having snapped long ago. Despite the decay, the intricate designs on the notes hinted at a time when they held great value. However, beyond that there was no real value.


[1/4/2025 4:50 PM] Mathias
**"Small and cramped. One way in and one way out.."**

[1/4/2025 5:24 PM] Ghost
*Ghost scanned the room as he spoke, his tone measured.* **"__One__ way in, __one__ way out. Not ideal. In a raid, you'd need a backup plan, something to misdirect and stall."**

*He moved toward the ruined vault door, running his hand over the twisted metal. His eyes briefly flicked to the scattered pile of decayed currency before continuing,* **"Getting this far wasn‚Äôt exactly a challenge. The factory? That was something else. You want barriers, things that slow people down and make them think twice. This place? It‚Äôs just easy pickings."**

**"Agreed... We s-"** His left eye lit up, receiving a call was he? **"Mmn?"**


[1/4/2025 7:42 PM] Mathias
He'd accept the call. It was from Cat.


[1/4/2025 7:45 PM] Narration
Somewhere not far from the border, Cat and Paige were already hard at work acquring the things they needed from the CCR. A lone patrol that was drinking on the job got a bit too frisky with the vixens of Horizon Grey and were uh... Entranced?

Paige was dragging a CCR agent's body towards the back of a dumpster. Struggling to drag the fat fuck's body. Numerous times she dropped him and scrambled to pick him back up. His head smacking against the asphalt once or twice.


[1/4/2025 7:47 PM] Cat Bayes
**"Heey- grh..."** *Cat paused, grunting as she struggled to pull the lawman's armored pants up her legs.* **"-Mathias? Hey uh, we need help."**


[1/4/2025 7:47 PM] KEADEUS STAUB
looks like you need someone with thighs that grip


[1/4/2025 7:48 PM] Ghost
*Ghost leaned against the wall, his gun and flashlight securely holstered. Crossing his arms, he watched silently, waiting for Mathias to finish.*


[1/4/2025 7:48 PM] Mathias
**"What happened?"** He asked curtly. Walking to one end of the safe.


[1/4/2025 7:51 PM] Cat Bayes
**"Well uh, we knocked out some CCR guys on patrol- Jesus Paige!"** *Cat watched as she dropped the fat fuck's head against the concrete __again__ before turning her focus back to the call.* **"But - ahem, we got their uniforms and now we just need the car, do you know where we can find one?"**

*...Cat, aren't you forgetting some context?*


[1/4/2025 7:52 PM] Paige
-# "Sorry!"


[1/4/2025 7:52 PM] Narration
She could be heard in the background.


[1/4/2025 7:53 PM] Ghost
-# *Ghost tilted his head slightly, wondering what in the fuck was happening on the other end of the call.*


[1/4/2025 7:54 PM] Mathias
He'd rub his temple. What in god's name were they thinking. **"Why are you screwing with the CCR?"**


[1/4/2025 7:54 PM] Cat Bayes
**"Oh right, for a prison break."** *...Huh?*


[1/4/2025 7:55 PM] Mathias
**"A pri-... Details."**


[1/4/2025 7:56 PM] Cat Bayes
*Cat, for fucks sake, context please.* **"So, you remember Kode?"**


[1/4/2025 7:56 PM] Mathias
**"Kode, you found him?"**


[1/4/2025 7:57 PM] Ghost
*Ghost was idly flipping his Ka-Bar knife in one hand. The blade twirled effortlessly between his fingers, a silent display of familiarity.*


[1/4/2025 7:57 PM] Ghost (pinned)

[1/4/2025 7:58 PM] Cat Bayes
**"Yeah, he's alive and probably well,"** *She paused once more, doing a slight hop to get the rest of those pants on her leggies.* **"But he's being held in a prison facility in Fairview. We got the plans for the building and found a weakspot, but we need a..."**

*Cat turned to face Paige.* **"Paige, what kind of car are we getting again?!"**


[1/4/2025 8:02 PM] Paige
-# "A Ion Enforcer! Their SUVs!"


[1/4/2025 8:02 PM] Cat Bayes
*She turned back to the call, as if she actually had a phone.* **"Ion Enforcer, that thing."**


[1/4/2025 8:03 PM] Cat Bayes
-# "Thanks!"


[1/4/2025 8:05 PM] Mathias
**"I am just hearing about this now. Don't you think it would have been better to inform me of something as dangerous as this before you jumped to action?"** Mathias would glance over towards Ghost. **"Adding Cole to the call. Add Paige."**


[1/4/2025 8:06 PM] Mathias
He would then begin walking towards the exit of the vault.


[1/4/2025 8:06 PM] Ghost

**"Explain to Cole here what you told me, Cat. I'm on the prowl."**

*Ghost slid his knife back into its sheath with a smooth motion and fell in step behind Mathias. For now, he remained silent.*

-# "..."


[1/4/2025 8:11 PM] Cat Bayes
**"Uhh, hey there Cole..."** *She swore she knew that name...eh, best not make it awkward, continue!* **"Long story short, we're busting a guy out of jail and need an Ion Enforcer for the plan to work."**

"URETHRA!"


[1/4/2025 8:32 PM] Mathias
**"We had one of those bastards past by us a few minutes ago."** He muttered as he reached door he broke down to enter the bank.


[1/4/2025 8:33 PM] Narration
As if the gods had answered his pleas. A spotlight shone on Mathias' face and soon Cole as he exited the bank. An Ion Enforcer entered the parking lot of the bank. It was doing a patrol and then spotted the two.


[1/4/2025 8:33 PM] Mathias
**"..."** He covered his eyes to shield them from the blinding light but made no immediate moves to retaliate.


[1/4/2025 8:39 PM] Ghost
*Ghost stepped out of the building, positioning himself beside Mathias. As soon as the patrol's beam illuminated them, he froze in place. Unlike Mathias, Ghost didn‚Äôt need to shield his eyes, his mask provided enough protection against the blinding light. His arms hung at his sides, his head tilted slightly downward, giving him a calm yet unreadable demeanour. He made no move to retaliate, remaining still.*


[1/4/2025 8:41 PM] Narration
The light refactored and scattered in the rain. The Ion Enforcer crept up onto them and then came to a halt. Both doors opened and two lawmen came out of their vehicles with rifles raised. **"Alright ladies, turn around and put your fucking hands on the wall before I decorate them in your honor!"** One of the lawmen would instruct.


[1/4/2025 8:41 PM] Mathias
He grumbled as he gave Ghost a 'look'


[1/4/2025 8:49 PM] Ghost
*Ghost remained still, as he returned the 'look'.*


[1/4/2025 8:50 PM] Narration
**"Not going to say it again."** The passenger had a shotgun, he'd rack one in the chamber.


[1/4/2025 8:51 PM] Mathias
He would start to comply, turning around and placing his hands flat on the wall in front of him.


[1/4/2025 8:53 PM] Ghost
*Ghost followed suit, turning around and placing his hands flat against the wall in front of him, his stance calm...*


[1/4/2025 8:56 PM] Narration
They could hear the crunching of boots and the splash of puddles approaching them. **"A homeless and a guy playing dress-up, looting an abandoned building. How original, stay where you are."** Soon, Ghost could feel one of them begin to pat him down which was exactly what he wanted...

*Ghost activated his cybernetic ability, disappearing from sight in an instant. Using this opportunity, Ghost used his left leg to sweep the cop off balance, sending him stumbling. Without hesitation, he reappeared in a blur of motion, grabbing the officer‚Äôs face with his left hand and slamming it into the concrete with brutal force.*

[1/4/2025 9:03 PM] Mathias
His arms had these black groves mimicking major veins. They quickly glow a rich blue like neon lights. The moment the lawmen on him touched him. Mathias elbowed the rifle at the back of his back. Causing it to go wide and out of reflect, the lawman let off a shot since he had terrible weapon discipline. He'd then spin around and grab the barrel of the rifle and began pulling and twisting his body.

The lawman held onto the rifle for dear life, knowing that if he lost the rifle he would be __cooked__. So now, Mathias was quite literally swinging this man around and around, his legs left the ground as he clung to his existence. Then, he'd release the gun. The gun went off with automatic fire. Tumbling uncontrollably, the lawmen's spine struck just above the front windshield and bounced up and over the truck. This is when he lost the rifle and continued flipping and struck a powerline down the street in an intersection. A colossal pop went off as the lawman's body was cooked to perfection. 

Then.... he fell and landed like a sack of shit.

[1/4/2025 9:09 PM] Ghost
*He immediately went to work. He drove his Ka-Bar knife into the officer‚Äôs skull with savage force, each thrust tearing through flesh and bone. The sound of cracking bone was drowned by the wet, gurgling splatter of blood as the blade sank deeper, until the officer‚Äôs face was a mangled mess, unrecognizable. He didn‚Äôt stop until the man‚Äôs body went **completely limp.***

[1/4/2025 9:11 PM] Mathias
He was already 'coolin' off as his veins began to fade back to black. Walking towards the driver side that was still ajar. He'd take stock of what was inside before climbing up on the sidestep. **"Let's go."**


[1/4/2025 9:13 PM] Ghost
# THUNK!
# THUNK!
# THUNK!
# THUNK!

# THUNK!

*Ghost stopped himself just in time, his hand frozen above the lifeless body, the knife still dripping with blood. For a moment, the bloodlust nearly overtook him. Shaking his head, he steadied himself. His mask and upper body were drenched in blood. He turned and made his way to Mathias, slipping into the car without a word.*


[1/4/2025 9:15 PM] Mathias
He'd take stock of the entire once more before shifting the vehicle in drive before even closing his door. He'd begin to ring Cat.


[1/4/2025 9:17 PM] Cat Bayes
*Cat picked up within the second ring.* **"Y'ello!"**


[1/4/2025 9:17 PM] Mathias
**"Got one, we are on our way. Things on your end?"**


[1/4/2025 9:20 PM] Cat Bayes
**"Holy shit, wha-"** *Ahem.* **"I-I mean, yeah, sounds good! Paige and I are all suited up and ready for action, I'm gonna be the 'new driver' for the CCR."**


[1/4/2025 9:20 PM] Ghost
-# "..."


[1/4/2025 9:21 PM] Mathias
**"Okay."** He'd hang up the call and continued to the point in silence.


[1/4/2025 9:24 PM] Narration
Paige and Cat were hiding out at their spot. Waiting anxiously for a Ion Enforcer to show itself. Luckily for them, the sound of a vehicle flying down the wet roads could be heard approaching and then. It began to slowdown, pulling into the dark lot. The headlights and brake lights were manually turned off to mask its visibility. Then, it stopped with the driver door opening up.


[1/4/2025 9:24 PM] Mathias
He hopped down, his head swiveling left and right.


[1/4/2025 9:26 PM] Paige
**"Right on time."** She'd remark as she emerged from the shadows. Carrying the gear from the Lawmen they knocked out. She'd drop the heap of gear just in front of the vehicle. **"Got a spare rifle and two handguns from them. Only one of them had a ballistic vest."**


[1/4/2025 9:32 PM] Ghost
*He stepped out of the vehicle, his body still drenched in blood. Leaning slightly against the enforcer, he crossed his arms, standing in silence.*


[1/4/2025 9:33 PM] Cat Bayes
**"Wow, you guys really did steal one that fast."** *Cat peeked her head out from around a corner, decked from neck to toe in CCR Armor. She looked like she was cringing a bit at the smell.* **"Fuckin' slobs..."** *She muttered under her breath.*


[1/4/2025 9:33 PM] Paige
She'd glance up towards Cole. **"...You're in the backseat on this one. No offense."**


[1/4/2025 9:34 PM] Ghost
*Ghost raised an eyebrow beneath his mask, but had no visible objection to it. He simply nodded and moved to the backseat, settling in without a word.*


[1/4/2025 9:35 PM] Cat Bayes
**"Oh shit...Boyfri- I mean uh...Cole, you good?"**


[1/4/2025 9:36 PM] Ghost
*Cole gave a small grunt, wiping the blood from his mask.*


[1/4/2025 9:39 PM] Mathias
He'd take a look at the gear. **"I'll take a handgun."**


[1/4/2025 9:39 PM] Paige
She tossed it to him.


[1/4/2025 9:39 PM] Mathias
With a clean catch, he'd pull the slide back with his index finger of the same hand before allowing the slide to slam forward. **"Didn't know they cut corners on the type of ammunition they used."** He'd tuck it into his jacket.


[1/4/2025 9:42 PM] Ghost
*Ghost broke his silence,* **"Handgun."**


[1/4/2025 9:43 PM] Paige
She would take the last handgun and begin to walk around the Ion Enforcer. **"You set, Cat?"** She'd call out as she vanished behind the large truck.


[1/4/2025 9:46 PM] Ghost
*He rolled the window down by pressing the button on the door panel with his index finger, then extended his hand out.*


[1/4/2025 9:47 PM] Paige
She'd hand it to him and gave him two magazines with her other hand.


[1/4/2025 9:51 PM] Ghost
*Ghost reached out, grabbing the handgun and magazines from Paige's side. He first checked the weight of the weapon, the smoothness of the slide, and the safety mechanism with a practiced hand. His fingers brushed over the grip, assessing the condition before he slid the magazine into the gun with a quick motion. He examined the loaded mag, checking for any irregularities. **16 rounds!** Satisfied, he tucked the weapon into his jacket, then stowed the extra magazines in one of his pouches.*


[1/4/2025 10:03 PM] Cat Bayes
*Just like how Mathias showed her, Cat pulled the lever back on her rifle to check her ammo count. Satisfied, she slung it over her back and made her way over to the driver's seat of the car.* **"Alright, we all ready to go?"**


[1/4/2025 10:08 PM] Paige
**"Sure am."** She would strap the lawman's helmet on so it would hide her hair.


[1/4/2025 10:08 PM] Mathias
He climbed in the back with Cole.


[1/4/2025 10:10 PM] Ghost
*Already seated, Ghost shifted slightly closer to his side to accommodate... Mathias‚Äô larger frame. He didn‚Äôt respond to Cat‚Äôs remark, he‚Äôd been ready the moment they left the hideout.*


[1/4/2025 10:10 PM] Paige
She would pop open the passenger door and climbed in.

**"I'll figure it out along the way."**

**"You...*know* the kind of BD's I watch, right?"**


[1/4/2025 10:29 PM] Paige
**"..."** She slowly looked forward. `"I should've at least asked that before doing this.."`


[1/4/2025 10:29 PM] Ghost
-# "..."


[1/4/2025 10:30 PM] Paige
**"Just... gently press the pedals."**


[1/4/2025 10:31 PM] Cat Bayes
**"I'm sure it'll be fine, just like the simulations!"** *Cat scoffed as she took hold of the wheels, grinning and brimming with confidence!*


[1/4/2025 10:32 PM] Ghost
*Ghost subtly shifted further toward his side, just enough to create a bit more space for Mathias. His hand also reached up to grip the car's roof handle, steadying himself...*


[1/4/2025 10:34 PM] Cat Bayes
**"That one's the..."** *Cat's foot was dancing between the brake and the gas for a few seconds. Lightly tapping the right most pedal, the car lurched forward before stopping again.* **"Oop! Nope, I got it now! Off we go!"**


[1/4/2025 10:37 PM] Cat Bayes
*And with that minor "hiccup", Cat shifted the gear into drive and pressed her foot down on the gas pedal! They were speeding off onto the road, with several cars honking at them.*


[1/4/2025 10:37 PM] Cat Bayes
*Well...at least it wouldn't be a long trip.*


[1/4/2025 10:38 PM] Paige
She gripped the front dash. Her nails nearly breaking from the intensity of her grip.


[1/4/2025 10:38 PM] Mathias
Cole had a great idea, roof handle it is...


[1/4/2025 10:39 PM] Ghost
*Ghost shot him a sharp, pointed look, a silent message that spoke volumes **without a single word.***

[1/4/2025 10:47 PM] Narration
Some __how__ and some ~~no~~__way__, Cat was approaching the checkpoint. There were CCR lawmen at the checkpoint as expected. There were two lanes on entering Fairview, the civilian lane and the CCR lane for emergency vehicles... As the Ion Enforcer approached the CCR lane, a lawman stepped out into the lane and held up his hand to signal Cat to come to a stop...


[1/4/2025 10:49 PM] Cat Bayes
# SKRT-
*The car stopped with a sudden jolt a little early, before easing in once again. When it got to the lawman...*
# SKRT-


[1/4/2025 10:52 PM] Narration
The lawman's right eyebrow rose as his hand slowly came down to his side. Then, he began to approach the driver side door. He wanted to have a conversation...


[1/4/2025 10:53 PM] Mathias
He would push himself back into the seat further. Minimizing his presence in the back was vital for this to work. His hand gripping his handgun.


[1/4/2025 10:53 PM] Paige
She made last minute adjustments to her helmet and pulled up the facemask she stole from the lawman. This would help concel her face from anyone who may know her facial features.


[1/4/2025 10:56 PM] Ghost
*Ghost leaned back in his seat, mirroring Mathias‚Äô posture, though his demeanour remained anything but. With precision, he drew both handguns, one in each hand, inspecting them as his eyes scanned the surroundings. **Dual-wielded** and ready, he kept his focus sharp, waiting for the moment to act...*


[1/4/2025 10:58 PM] Cat Bayes
*Once she confirmed everyone was ready ~~and not clutching the handlebars with white knuckles~~, Cat adjusted her helmet and facemask before lowering the driver side window for the officer to see them.* **"Evening, sir."** *She greeted, her hands kept on the wheel.*


[1/4/2025 10:59 PM] Narration
**"Brakes giving you issues, eh?"** Was the first thing he asked with a humorous half-smile. A good mood, we like that.

[1/4/2025 11:01 PM] Cat Bayes
*What, was there something wrong with her parking? Giving him a shrug and a dry chuckle, she nodded in response.* **"Ahh yeah, it's been putzing out on me all night. Fuckin' mechanics cutting corners, amirite?"**


[1/4/2025 11:02 PM] Narration
**"Fourth Enforcer to do it.. Seriously, command needs to step on their necks."** He'd extend his hand towards Cat. He must be wanting her credentials. It was a good thing he wasn't suspicious of her.


[1/4/2025 11:02 PM] Cat Bayes
*Ah, this must be what Mathias was yelling to her in the car on the way here. Fortunately, she's __very__ good when it comes to multitasking, and managed to give herself the new identity on the way here!*

~~Don't worry about the scuff marks on the side.~~


[1/4/2025 11:04 PM] Cat Bayes
*Reaching over, she handed him the chip with her very real identity.*


[1/4/2025 11:06 PM] Ghost
*Ghost barely restrained himself, his body urging him to eliminate these bastards on the spot. The memory of his last encounter in Fairview still burned fresh in his mind. His grip on the handguns tightened, knuckles white with tension.*

[1/4/2025 11:08 PM] Narration
The CCR agent would take the chip and scan it with his headset. **"You know, the last Enforcer came through here struck the barrier to your right. When I say my supervisor was pissed was an understatement. Did you know, they are prototyping an Ion Enforcer III? Comes with a mounted gun and everything!"**

**"Yeah man... Too bad they won't give the Heights stations anything. Budget and yada yada."** He paused and his smile faded as he stared at the chip. **"Huh..."**


[1/4/2025 11:12 PM] Ghost
# *Tick tock. Tick tock. Tick tock. Tick tock. Tick tock. Tick tock. Tick tock. Tick tock. Tick tock. Tick tock.*


[1/4/2025 11:13 PM] Cat Bayes
*Huh? Huh what? Whaddaya mean huh?* **"Is...something wrong?"** *She asked, trying to keep a calm and level voice despite the rising tension in her mind.*


[1/4/2025 11:13 PM] Narration
**"We had a credential refresh three minutes ago. At midnight and yours didn't get the new key."** He'd access his retina interface and start looking around. **"One second."**


[1/4/2025 11:14 PM] Paige
She inhaled slowly and equally as slow when exhaling.


[1/4/2025 11:16 PM] Ghost
*Ghost quietly thumbed the hammers of both handguns back, his movements deliberate. His eyes remained fixed ahead, scanning for any signs of escalation.*


[1/4/2025 11:16 PM] Cat Bayes
*Part of her wanted to give Mathias a look in the back, but she knew that would most likely cause suspicion. Just play it cool Cat, you're doing fine, you're just another CCR Shitter Goon.* **"Huh...Weird, think it's a bug? Wouldn't put it past maintenance to fuck something like that up too."**


[1/4/2025 11:22 PM] Narration
**"Ehh..."** The lawman looked up towards Cat with a subtle side-eye before moving to his counter-part in the other lane. **"Hey, Vince. Come look at this. I think we got a bad chip."**
-# "Let me look." Vince's attention was grabbed and he met with him.

They were now out of ear shot so no one could hear their conversation.


[1/4/2025 11:23 PM] Paige
**"Not looking good... Mathias?"** She muttered.


[1/4/2025 11:23 PM] Mathias
**"Key renewal is new. The timing isn't the best."**


[1/4/2025 11:23 PM] Cat Bayes
-# "Fuuuuckk..."
*Now that the two were out of earshot, Cat subtly turned to look at her cohorts, especially in the back.* **"Will it cause an issue?"** *She asked Mathias quietly.*


[1/4/2025 11:24 PM] Ghost
*Ghost let out a low, grating breath, almost like a suppressed growl, the sound barely escaping his lips. His grip tightened on the handguns, **his fingers itching for action.** A quiet, almost imperceptible chuckle slipped through, more out of impatience than amusement, as if the situation was testing him.*


[1/4/2025 11:24 PM] Mathias
**"We'll know here shortly."**


[1/4/2025 11:25 PM] Cat Bayes
**"And what do I do if it does?"**


[1/4/2025 11:25 PM] Mathias
**"Drive."**


[1/4/2025 11:25 PM] Cat Bayes
**"...I can do that."**


[1/4/2025 11:25 PM] Ghost
**"I shoot."**


[1/4/2025 11:26 PM] Narration
It looks like the two lawmen were done conversing. With the one Cat was interacting with returning. His head was down as he continued to inspect the chip.


[1/4/2025 11:27 PM] Cat Bayes
*Cat turned her attention back to the lawman, doing her best to remain calm.* **"Well? How's it looking man?"**


[1/4/2025 11:27 PM] Narration
He'd then hand it back. **"Seems to be a bad communicator on this one. When you return to the station, get a new one issued. We've been having some bad actors coming through here lately."**


[1/4/2025 11:29 PM] Narration
The large gate doors would then begin to sink into the ground, slowly revealing Fairview beyond the checkpoint.


[1/4/2025 11:29 PM] Cat Bayes
**"Ahh, fucking hate those."** *She replied, internally breathing a sigh of relief as she took the chip.* **"I'll make sure I do that, you stay safe out here, aight?"**


[1/4/2025 11:30 PM] Narration
**"You as well."** He would then turn his back to them. Going to help his partner deal with the civilian traffic attempting to get through.


[1/4/2025 11:31 PM] Narration
The gate was now down...


[1/4/2025 11:31 PM] Cat Bayes
**"Will do..."** *Cat raised the window and drove through the gate.* **"...Fucker."**


[1/4/2025 11:32 PM] Paige
**"Been a while since I have been to Fairview..."** She'd comment. **"If it was my choice, I'll prefer Haven Heights..."**


[1/4/2025 11:33 PM] Narration
For Cat, it was a complete difference on this side of the wall from Haven Height's. There was no trash, no debris and each building appeared to be well maintained.


[1/4/2025 11:34 PM] Ghost
*Ghost lowered himself, his body instinctively pulling closer to the seat, a move driven by his **own reasons**.*


[1/4/2025 11:35 PM] Cat Bayes
**"Only ever been here in the BD's, it's so...bright."** *Cat leaned forward aginst the wheel, gazing at the towering skyscrapers and neon lights illuminating the night sky...there were no stars over Fairview.* **"Gonna be honest with ya...not a fan."**


[1/4/2025 11:37 PM] Ghost
*Ghost broke his silence with a low voice.* **"Place isn't bad. You get used to it."**


[1/4/2025 11:38 PM] Paige
**"You don't strike me as the guy to leave a honest review on Fairview."** She remarked, looking out her window.


[1/4/2025 11:39 PM] Cat Bayes
**"Would'cha look at that, he has a voice!"** *Yeah sure, he did speak earlier, but it was only one word and Cat wasn't really paying attention to him at the time.*

*Ghost gave a small grunt in response.*

[1/4/2025 11:41 PM] Cat Bayes
**"Mmh."** *It was Cat's turn to grunt in response. Mathias is right, they were quite literally in the belly of the beast now.*

[1/13/2025 8:34 PM] Narration
The Horizon Grey gang arrived to the abandoned factory with the two Ion Enforcers. Mathias had hopped out of a vehicle and opened the large overhead bay doors for the two trucks to be able to be pulled in. The factory still lacked power, if it wasn't for the bright day, the entire factory would have been plunged into complete darkness. Light filtered in from the skywindows above them.

Refusing to allow Cat drive anytime soon, Paige turned off the Ion Enforcer and opened her door. Stepping out onto the running board and down onto the concrete floor surface. **"This place is huge."** She remarked, walking deeper into the factory. **"Reminds me of that one base near Kilo..."**

Kode pulled Dylan out of the second Ion Enforcer. Her seemingly lifeless body moving this way and that until Mathias managed to help him with her legs. **"Urgh.... She's heavier than she looks."**


[1/13/2025 8:40 PM] Ghost
*Ghost stared at her lifeless body for a brief moment after he stepped out. He then turned away, his gaze fixed on the factory ahead.*


[1/13/2025 8:41 PM] Cat Bayes
*Cat opened the front passenger door of the first Ion Enforcer shortly after Paige, disembarking the vehicle with her focus directed to the rundown factory.* **"Holy shit, you guys weren't kidding about it's size."**


[1/13/2025 8:42 PM] Mathias
**"First order of business is to get power running. Cat, investigate that."** He would point in the direction of the generators. **"Generator room is in that direction. Paige, help her."**


[1/13/2025 8:43 PM] Paige
**"Oh-ho-ho... Someone's taking charge."** She'd smirk as she briskly walked past him and Kode whom were carrying Dylan.


[1/13/2025 8:47 PM] Cat Bayes
**"Roger that, Sir!"** *Cat gave Mathias a playful salute before jogging to catch up with Paige!*

*Ghost decided to keep watch over the area, staying on guard to ensure nothing unusual happened in the meantime.*


[1/13/2025 8:57 PM] Narration
Cat and Paige entered the generator room. There was a low hum to the machinery and dim lights highlighting the many control panels that decorated the entire room. There were perhaps 10 generators and dozens of smaller stations that supported them.


[1/13/2025 8:57 PM] Paige
**"This... is going to be tricky."** She whispered to herself as she randomly approached one of the panels.


[1/13/2025 9:01 PM] Cat Bayes
**"Eeh..."** *Yeah, Cat's heart was sinking as she witnessed the various machinery and industrial tech that dotted the humming room. Of course a factory of this size would need a substantial amount of power running it.* **"...Naaah, we got this, right? My deck should be able to highlight the important bits, or at least whatever's supposed to turn these monsters on."**


[1/13/2025 9:07 PM] Paige
**"Erm... Yeah...."** Paige placed her hands on the keyboard that was held up by a little stand. Trying to make sense of the panel before here. **"Compressor 7. Hm."**


[1/13/2025 9:09 PM] Paige
**"The closest I've gotten to mechanical and electrical engineering are diesel engines."** She admitted, looking back towards Cat. **"There should be some larger interface we can tinker with. One that would give us a beat on the deetz."**


[1/13/2025 9:11 PM] Cat Bayes
**"Put me in front of a computer and I should be able to work some magic..."** *Even then, the sheer layout of this room was quite intimidating to the tiny netrunner, hopefully she doesn't end up breaking something.* **"What got you working on diesel engines, by the way?"**

*Tapping the side of her temple, her eyes flashed that familiar orange as she began to scan the room for clues.*


[1/13/2025 9:25 PM] Paige
**"Mechanic for Horizon Grey. Anything that didn't take a fusion core, we used diesels. Anything else wouldn't last long enough outside these walls."**


[1/13/2025 9:25 PM] Narration
There were traces from dozens of terminals all leading off somewhere beyond the cluster of generator that stood in front of Cat. She'd need to go around them! Lucky for her, there was ample room to do so!


[1/13/2025 9:27 PM] Cat Bayes
**"Huh! Did you uh...get that from Kode?"** *Cat couldn't help but do a little harmless prying as she made her way around the maze of industrial generators to find her __treasure__~*


[1/13/2025 9:29 PM] Paige
**"Get what?"** She'd call out towards Cat.


[1/13/2025 9:29 PM] Narration
Upon a raised platform was the largest terminal of them all. Right before Cat's very eyes. Large tubes ran hapazardly around the base of the terminal, vanishing beneath those cool to the touch panels. Upon the top of the base was the terminal set. Buttons, switches, and screens that were pulsing a dull amber.


[1/13/2025 9:37 PM] Cat Bayes
**"The whole mechanic stuff! I dunno, seems like what he does is kinda similar!"** *Cat called back, before turning to the __massive__ terminal raised on the platform. Her eyes followed the tubes until they couldn't no more, a smile gracing her lips.* **"Well hello there, beautiful...~"** *She muttered under her breath.*

*She clambered up the platform, making her way to the terminal  as she went about trying to activate it.*


[1/13/2025 9:40 PM] Narration
Nothing seemed to be waking the terminal. None of the immediate analog inputs nor touching of the screen woke the system from its slumber. Hmm.


[1/13/2025 9:43 PM] Cat Bayes
**"Mmh..."** *Did her cyber vision yield any clues? Was the terminal even receiving power?*


[1/18/2025 12:41 PM] Narration
There was power being sent to this terminal in question, however despite manual inputs it was not awake.

The amount of power that it was receiving was quite underwhelming if Cat analyzed the transmission rate. 

Further investigation would yield that terminal 7 which Paige stood in front of was throwing power to terminal 2, which Cat was near.

The only terminal that was "pointing" towards terminal 0 (Cat) was terminal 3. Terminals 1 2 4 5 6 7 8 9 we're all pointing at one another.


[1/18/2025 12:43 PM] Narration
Another goddamn puzzle. Who redirected power like this, and what for?


[1/21/2025 8:19 PM] Cat Bayes
**"Tsk, what kind of asshole wired these machines...?"** *This was a complete and total mess! Even the weird London panel she found at that one building had better electrical maintenance than this!...This is gonna end up bothering her the whole time she's here, isn't it?*

*Looking around the room, she glanced over to Terminal 7 before looking over towards Terminal 3. Were there any terminals pointing to 3?*

*She'd need to sort out these connections if she wanted to make any progress getting this place up and running...*


[1/21/2025 8:21 PM] Narration
There were no panels directed towards terminal three.


[1/21/2025 8:26 PM] Cat Bayes
*Ah, now she was starting to pick up on what was happening here. It was quite literally like playing connect the dots.*

*Alright, now she just needs to optimize the connection flow - and since 3 was already on the right track - she'd leave that alone for now.*

*Okay, which panel was closest to three, and what was it pointing to?*

3 was neighboring 2 and 6. The connections for those two were as follows:
6 <-> 5
2 <-> 1


[1/21/2025 8:36 PM] Paige
**"Nah, there was this mechanic name we called Ham that used to fix all our wheels. Seeing him work on them was fascinating to me. So, decided to make up some tools and get my hands dirty."** She explained as she began looking between the terminals.

**"Ham? Was he part of Horizon Grey or did he just help out a bunch?"** *Cat asked as she continued to work, noting down the __weird ass__ connections in her cyberdeck.*

*Okay, now she needs to do a thorough check for the rest of them. What was four, eight, and nine doing?*


[1/21/2025 8:49 PM] Narration
4 was connected to 1. Between the two, 1 had the most power, generating its own power and acquiring 4's power.
Eight and Nine were connected to one another. Power was distributed evenly between them.

**"He was with us, greys, for a while. Lost contact with him when Vespera raided our bases."** She said as she was tinkering with the terminal. **"Huh, why does this terminal say 2 on the display?"** She inquired to herself mainly.


[1/21/2025 9:04 PM] Cat Bayes
*Okay, she had a decent idea of what was going on here now.*

*She had to assume 1 was the terminal that acted as the input for the power, and for some reason, it was sucking up all the power from 4 - probably because it had nowhere else to go.* **"Yeah! It's one of the terminals in the room!"** *She called out to Paige, updating her on the situation.* **"Whoever wired these terminals was a fucking opp, it's the god damned warehouse facility all over again!"** *Warehouse facility- what?*

*Huh, okay...so what if she-* **"Uuhh...fuck me, okay. Let's try something!"** *She looked over towards terminal four.* **"There's a terminal like the one you're at directly south of you, can you find it real quick?"**


[1/21/2025 9:05 PM] Paige
**"Which way is south?!"** She'd call out, taking a few steps back from terminal 7.


[1/21/2025 9:08 PM] Cat Bayes
**"Oop, sorry - layout in this room is fucken weird."** *Uhhh, ah!* **"Make your way around the terminal until you're behind it and keep walking forward, you should come across another one."**


[1/21/2025 9:10 PM] Paige
Paige would do as she was instructed until she came across terminal 4. **"At terminal 4!"**


[1/21/2025 9:11 PM] Cat Bayes
**"Can you tell me what's on the screen?"** *She called back.*


[1/21/2025 9:12 PM] Paige
**"It's showing output being 1"**


[1/21/2025 9:12 PM] Cat Bayes
**"Is there a way to change the output to 7?"**


[1/21/2025 9:17 PM] Paige
**"Let's see here.."** She would screw with the terminal until it prompted her to change the output. **"Oh, looks like I can... and... 7"**


[1/21/2025 9:17 PM] Narration
**CHUNK! CHUUURRRRNNNNNNNNNNNN** Terminals 7, 4, and 1 fired up and were producing a significant amount of power. Then, there was a loud bang. Terminal 2 was overloaded. A red alarm light flashed at terminal 2. 
7,4, 1 were still spinning their generators.

**"Uh oh."** Her voice could be heard faintly underneath the generators.


[1/21/2025 9:18 PM] Narration
**1** was now being given a lot of power. Collecting power from 7 and 4.


[1/21/2025 9:18 PM] Cat Bayes
**"Fucks sake!"** *Cat's voice was loudly heard, on the other hand! Leaving her spot, she ran over to terminal 2 to inspect the damage.*


[1/21/2025 9:23 PM] Narration
The terminal was grounding itself so the damage was mitigated, for now. The output was flashing 1 in red when the other terminals showed green numbers.


[1/21/2025 9:24 PM] Paige
She walked over towards Cat. **"Did we fuck up?"**


[1/21/2025 9:26 PM] Cat Bayes
**"Not yet, but we'll have to move quick."** *Cat was quickly tip tapping away at the keyboard, clearly engaged in her focus!* **"Up ahead should be terminal five. I need you to head over there and change it's output to eight - and lemme know when you do!"**


[1/21/2025 9:29 PM] Paige
**"You got it!"** She'd turn on her heel and jog away.


[1/21/2025 9:29 PM] Narration
A few moments later, there was an audible click.


[1/21/2025 9:29 PM] Paige
**"Done!"**


[1/21/2025 9:29 PM] Narration
Both terminals 5 and 6 were constantly clicking, as if trying to start up but unable to get enough juice.

[1/21/2025 9:32 PM] Narration
The moment she switched it to 5, 9 let out a loud bang, followed by the alarm red light.
8,5,2 came to life and was revving up. 7,4,1 were flashing green lights by this time. Almost like saying they were ready for something!

**"Ahh...not quite as awesome."** *Well, there goes that high she was riding.* **Ugggggh! Fuck you whoever set this shitty..."** *The rest of that sentence was said in mumbles, but Paige could swear she saw an ominous aura radiating from Cat.* **"Why is every electrical engineer in this district my sworn nemesis, brooooo?"**

Considering it was their first time in the factory, they did not precisely know where the others went in this sizeable factory. There was the main assembly floor, which evidently had a giant sinkhole in it. Then, there were the corridors and hallways that led to what were once offices and other rooms. Luckily for them, they weren't far from their location, with Cat opening the door where they were in.


[1/21/2025 11:03 PM] Kode
Kode was seated in a folding chair left behind and scooted up against one of the far walls. His head resting against the solid verticle surface with his eyes closed and arms folded as if he was taking a small nap. **". . ."** Though, when he heard the door opening automatically, one eye peeled open.


[1/21/2025 11:03 PM] Mathias
He was in the process of setting down one of the few crates they managed to stuff in one of the Ion Enforcers. It contained miscellaneous supplies waiting to be sorted. His back was towards Cat as she entered.


[1/21/2025 11:03 PM] Narration
Dylan was in the same state they left her at the previous hideout. Unconscious on a cot on the floor.


[1/21/2025 11:07 PM] Ghost
*Ghost leaned against the wall, idly flipping his knife between his fingers with a practiced, almost hypnotic rhythm. The blade twirled and glinted under the light. His mask concealed his expression, but his gaze was unmistakably locked on Dylan. Whatever thoughts lingered behind that mask, they remained **unknown.***


[1/21/2025 11:36 PM] Cat Bayes
*Hey you, down boy!*

*Cat glanced over at Ghost before shifting her gaze to Dylan, then back to Ghost. She was really hoping that psycho wasn't gonna try anything crazy...*

*Finally directing her attention to Mathias, she coughed into her fist to gain his attention.* **"Power's up and running, boss man!~"**


[1/21/2025 11:43 PM] Mathias
**"So I heard."** He said as he stood straight up and turned towards the blue-haired Asian. **"Good work."**


[1/21/2025 11:43 PM] Paige
She followed behind Cat. Hands on hips! **"Power is up, which would make acclimating to our new home much more attainable."**


[1/21/2025 11:43 PM] Kode
**"There is still the Purafish problem."** He mumbled. His eyes now closed again as he tried to return to rest. **"Likely a nest of them."**


[1/21/2025 11:43 PM] Paige
**"Right, Purafish. Considering the lights are on, they won't be wiggling up here. That at least provides us with some security."**


[1/21/2025 11:43 PM] Kode
**"True, but if we want to find that outlet that we believe there to be. They'll have to be dealt with first."**


[1/22/2025 12:00 AM] Cat Bayes
**"Anything I can do to help with the situation?"** *Cat offered, raising her hand in the air.*


[1/22/2025 12:02 AM] Ghost
*Ghost was, as usual, simply paying attention.*


[1/22/2025 3:55 PM] Mathias
**"Don't know how much help you would be."** He admitted flatly. **"There might be dam gates down there you could access now that the power has been restored. But, we don't know if power extends beyond the treatment plant where Cole confronted the Purafish."** He sat on top of the crate. **"The pura should be our secondary priority. Moving all of our things and cleaning our tracks should take priority. "**


[1/22/2025 3:57 PM] Paige
**"I rather not have CCR sniffers picking up our trail. Would make this move all-for-nothing. I reckon that a few more trips the next few days should do it for the moving. Then, we can take on our little fishy problem."**

**"We also need to do some shopping. I'm afraid our guest here won't last long without a neural deck."** He finally sat up and rested his elbows upon his legs. 

**"We'll start to have irreversible effects cropping up within days. Infection, dehydration, malnutrition, and others."**


[1/22/2025 4:05 PM] Paige
**"We'll have to find low traffic entry points into the Metro then. Do you know of any?"** She looked towards Cole.


[1/22/2025 4:25 PM] Ghost
*Ghost's voice was curt.* **"Maintenance tunnels. Quiet. Secure."**


[1/22/2025 4:33 PM] Paige
**"I suggest Cole and Cat handle immediate logistics of new supplies. Out of all of us, you two are the most low-profile."**


[1/22/2025 4:33 PM] Kode
**"The beauty of a decentralized economy is that the CCR cannot freeze accounts. I can cover essentials, primarily things we will need for me to do what I do best. When either of you go out, I'll forward a little shopping list."**


[1/22/2025 4:45 PM] Ghost
*Ghost continued to toy with his knife, the subtle movements seeming to reflect his silent agreement. Heading to the Metro was no less dangerous than venturing anywhere else in Haven Heights.*

 **"That's uh..."** *She glanced over towards Ghost, watching as he played with his knife for a moment.* **"...fine, but it's probably a better idea for us to split up, cover more ground and grab our shit faster."**


[1/22/2025 5:25 PM] Paige
She would shrug in indifference, **"As long as things stay smooth, I'm game. Come on, we should make one more trip. We can then figure out rooms and shit."** She would turn on her heel and turn around the frame of the door.

[1/22/2025 10:53 PM] Narration
Cat and Cole arrived back to the hideout. Power was still running strong as ever. Since the first day they have been there, Dylan had been relocated to a more secure room since they were now not so preset and it would more difficult to keep watch on her. Kode was not to be found immediately, if they were to search for them, it would most certainly be at his 'office'.


[1/22/2025 10:57 PM] Ghost
*Ghost wasted no time. He moved swiftly to his 'room' and placed his belongings in a secure spot, ensuring everything was in order.*


[1/22/2025 10:58 PM] Cat Bayes
**"We're baaa-"** *Cat was about to announce their return before Ghost brushed past her, the netrunner watching as he quickly went about reorganizing his shit. Efficient as a machine, that one.*

*With a sigh, she went to go find Kode and Dylan.*


[1/22/2025 10:58 PM] Ghost
*He moved to his desk, lined up with others, his equipment scattered across the surface. Setting the duffle bag down, he unpacked his items. He firmly grabbed the box of impact grenades, placing it aside, followed by the box of smoke grenades. Opening them, he retrieved **two** impact grenades and **one** smoke grenade, securing them in his pouch.*


[1/22/2025 11:10 PM] Narration
Cat walked into Kode's office to find Mathias and Paige being treated for what appeared to be pretty nasty injuries... the sharp scent of antiseptic mingled with the metallic tang of blood in the air.

Paige sat slumped against the chair, her body a portrait of suffering. One eye was gone entirely, leaving an empty socket, while the other barely cracked open, its iris clouded with exhaustion and pain. Her face was a grotesque mask of swelling and bruises, dried rivulets of blood streaking from her nostrils and mouth. Tangled clumps of her once-pristine hair clung to her face, matted with sweat and grime. Cuts and deep purple bruises marred her arms, some crudely bandaged, others left to weep crimson trails. It was clear her head had borne the brunt of the assault‚Äîjagged lacerations carved into her scalp‚Äîand the way her legs trembled when she shifted suggested they weren‚Äôt faring much better.

Mathias, on the other hand, was a different kind of broken. He sat bare-chested, his arms gone entirely, the stumps where they had been crudely sealed, leaking trails of red blood mingled with an unnatural, viscous blue liquid. The fluids had streaked down his sides, staining his skin in sickly patterns. A jagged, fresh wound carved into the center of his chest pulsed faintly, its edges raw and inflamed. Despite the apparent severity of his injuries, Mathias‚Äôs face betrayed an eerie calm, as though he had made peace with his pain‚Äîor had been pushed far beyond it.

Kode was hunched over Paige, his mechanical hands a blur of precision. Whirring and clicking, the finely-tuned appendages adjusted as he guided a gleaming synthetic eye into the empty socket. Each movement of the gyroscopic fingers was deliberate, the faint hum of machinery barely audible over the tension in the room. His face was tight with focus, but his eyes flickered with unease, betraying the weight of the moment.


[1/22/2025 11:10 PM] Kode
**"Just in time."** He murmured as he heard Cat entering the room. He glanced over his shoulder. **"Hand me that, please."** He would point towards an unlabled box at his desk for Cat to retrieve. He seemed oddly calm himself.


[1/22/2025 11:19 PM] Cat Bayes
**"-"** *Cat __froze__ the moment she entered the room. Her eyes frantically scanning between both Paige and Mathias as everything else was toned out. Her heartbeat quickened and breathing scattered, mind trying to process what exactly she was looking at.*

*Was that Paige? Was that Mathias? No, that couldn't be the case, right? She was just talking to them yesterday, so that meant it wasn't them. __It wasn't them__. That's what her mind was telling.*

*It was them, and they were hurt. Bad.*

*She looked at the socket where Paige's eye should've been, and face going pale as she tried to draw the strength to mutter something.* **"Pai...?"** *She didn't know what to say, it was difficult processing anything-*

[1/22/2025 11:23 PM] Paige
Paige moved her head ever so slightly so that her good eye could see Cat. But, it was nothing but a blur with the moisture blinding her. Raising her arms would perhaps lead to extreme pain if she were to try to wipe them. **"Hey..."** She muttered, trying to put on a face... any face for that matter. **"I look like shit, don't I?"**


[1/22/2025 11:23 PM] Kode
**"I need you to focus, please, hand me that box."** His tone darkened. The once calm turned to a underlying urgency. He needed Cat to cooperate!


[1/22/2025 11:23 PM] Mathias
He looked up towards Cat, but remained silent.


[1/22/2025 11:27 PM] Cat Bayes
*Cat was frozen stiff for a few moments more, her face darkened under the bangs of her hair before she quietly - and stiffly - moved to the desk and picked up the box.*

*She made her way over to Kode before holding it out to him, her eyes never leaving her sister for even a moment.*

-# "What...happened?"

*Cat quietly asked Paige, barely even a whisper. Tears were beginning to stream down her cheeks.* **"A-Are...Does it...."**


[1/22/2025 11:33 PM] Kode
Kode took the box with his one free hand and flipped open the lid. Taking out a syringe out of the assortment and injecting it into Paige's thigh. **"This will combat the swelling and help with the pain."** He stated, coming down from the brief moment of haste.


[1/22/2025 11:33 PM] Paige
**"Got jumped by the Vesperian Legion."** She flinched as the medication began to enter her system. **"Got us real good."** Her good-ish eye looking up towards Cat. **"How'd did your shopping go? Cole didn't give you a hard time, did he?"** Paige was really trying to deflect from her current state. Try as she may, even she knew it was futile.


[1/22/2025 11:39 PM] Cat Bayes
**"Don't-"** *Cat didn't want Paige to treat this as if it were nothing. She was missing an eye for fucks sake! But the last thing she probably needs is for her to freak out on her, as much as she wanted to.*

*Instead, she cracked an uneasy smile and tried her best to speak normally.* **"W-Well...uh, I um...I bought a new cyberdeck for myself. I-I can help with the missions a lot better now."** *She was sharply breathing in between every other word, she couldn't stop the tears from flowing anymore.* **"A-And Ghost was uh...he was quiet, y'know...I-"**

**"Oh god, Paige..."** *She couldn't keep it in anymore, her eyes tracking down to Kode.* **"Is she...are they gonna be okay?"**


[1/22/2025 11:45 PM] Kode
**"She's concious, she remembers everything, and she's talkin."** He finished putting Paige's new eye in before swiveling his chair towards Cat. **"It could be worst.. Short answer; She'll be alright."**


[1/22/2025 11:45 PM] Paige
She blinked a few times, adjusting to it, **"Ugh... I hate this feeling."** She muttered.


[1/22/2025 11:49 PM] Cat Bayes
*Cat exhaled through her nostrils as she leaned against the bed, her head hanging low as her hair drooped past her face. A dry chuckle escaped her lips.* **"You look like shit, both of you."** *Turning over to Mathias, she winced for a moment. It was hard to look at any of them.* **"You said Paige would be okay...does that include Mathias?"** *She asked Kode.*


[1/22/2025 11:51 PM] Kode
**"Oh, him. He's fine."** He'd grumble, standing up and going to his desk. **"Seen him get hit with much worst things."**


[1/22/2025 11:52 PM] Mathias
**"Don't worry about me."** He kept Cat's gaze. **"I can't feel it anyways."**

[1/22/2025 11:57 PM] Ghost
*Ghost walked into the room, fully strapped with gear. His handguns were holstered at his sides, and an assault rifle rested across his back. He looked every bit ready for a battle. As soon as he stepped in, his gaze swept across the room‚Äîfirst landing on Paige, then Mathias, followed by Cat, and finally Kode.*

*He said nothing more than,* 

# "Rough day?"

# "..."


[1/22/2025 11:59 PM] Paige
**"It's one of those days, alright."** She lauged, but quickly stopped as a sharp pain reminded her that she was hurt.


[1/23/2025 12:02 AM] Ghost
**"Heading to Fairview. Got a small errand to run."** *Ghost stated bluntly, his tone flat. He didn't react to the situation around him, giving a small nod before __slowly__ turning to leave.*


[1/23/2025 12:03 AM] Cat Bayes
**"...Bakayarou."** *Cat muttered in Japanese. She breathed out a deep sigh before chuckling too, turning to look at Paige with a meek smile.* **"You gonna be okay, sis?"**


[1/23/2025 12:10 AM] Paige
**"I'll be back on my feet before you know it."** She'd give Cat a weak thumbs up.


[1/23/2025 12:12 AM] Cat Bayes
**"You'd better, or I won't give you anymore discounts on my BD's."** *Cat scoffed in return, turning to Mathias.* **"Same goes for you, big guy, and I make good on my threats!"**

**"Do not. You'll hurt yourself more than what the medication will handle..."** He then turned towards Cat. **"Listen, whatever you got going on. Freddie is __NOT__ someone you want to be going after."**

*Ghost was just about to exit the building.*

[1/23/2025 12:40 AM] Cat Bayes
**"Uh..."** *Well, now that she was here, she didn't really know what to tell him. He'd probably ignore her if she told him not to go after his mission, even if she explained what was going on.*

**"Kode uh, needs you for something for a moment."** *It wasn't really a lie, and Kode would probably be able to explain the situation better than she could.*


[1/23/2025 12:42 AM] Ghost
*Ghost stared at her for a brief moment in silence. Then, tilting his head slightly, he asked,* **‚ÄúWhy now?‚Äù**


[1/23/2025 12:42 AM] Cat Bayes
**"Dunno, guess he forgot something?"**


[1/23/2025 12:46 AM] Ghost
*He was **doubtful**. Ghost had made it clear where he was headed earlier. What could be so important that required his presence now? He turned fully around and made his way back to the room.*


[1/23/2025 12:47 AM] Cat Bayes
*Once he was out of earshot, Cat slumped forward and let out a groan. Why was talking to that man so damn stressful?*

*Her eyes flashed orange as she sent Kode a quick message. *
```fix
"He's on his way back, told him you forgot to tell him something."

Just before Cole could enter the room, Kode exited the room, nearly bumping into the man.


[1/24/2025 5:43 PM] Kode
**"There you are."** He remarked, smoothing out the front of his clothes. Dried blood caking his hands and his outer garments. **"I was told you would pay Fred a visit..."** There was a slight pause, trying to manifest the order of words he wished to have. **"You've targeted Paige, and from what I know, you meant harm. Now, you're after Fred. I do not know what you're thinking, and frankly, that is a problem for everyone here."**

Kode then removed his glasses and took the hem of his undershirt with his digits to clean the smudges that plagued the lenses. With his eyes downcast towards the meticulous cleaning process, Kode continued, **"I suppose now is the time you explain your motives. Otherwise, your unknown methodology might just get you killed."**


[1/24/2025 5:54 PM] Ghost
*Ghost took a small step back from the near collision, his gaze narrowing on Kode as he listened in silence. The words sank in, each one processed with care. He didn‚Äôt fully grasp what warranted such scrutiny, but he recognized the need to respond. His voice, low and calculated, broke the tense air between them.*

**"From your phrasing, it seems you have some __familiarity__ with this man."** *He tilted his head slightly, his tone devoid of emotion.* **"Though it doesn't __justify__ this sudden interference."**


[1/24/2025 6:09 PM] Kode
**"Heh."** He'd crack a slight smile before putting his glasses back on his face. His gaze was towards the ceiling just behind the man before falling down towards his mask. **"Actually, you'd be wrong, but I can look past that for the time being."** The smile faded. **"Fred was an engineer for Horizon Grey. If you were to do anything to him, your tenure with what Paige and Mathias have going on would end faster than you could draw your iron."**

Kode shifted his weight; **"And I would avoid violence if I was in your boots. Saying he is dangerous would do you no good to understand the severity of what dealing you might have with him."** Brief pause. **"I get it; you keep it to yourself. You handle your own business on your own terms. But I would suggest from a man who has been in the game much longer to take a step back and get a second perspective. Are you following?"**


[1/24/2025 6:32 PM] Ghost
**"Anything else?"** *Ghost's tone was devoid of any unnecessary inflection. His expression, masked and unreadable as ever, hinted at neither irritation nor intrigue, just efficiency.*


[1/24/2025 6:34 PM] Kode
He would simply shake his head.

Kaedues was peeling into Gavyn's workplace around 5 minutes before 8, giving him ample time to arrive exactly on time. Upon entering, Kaedues would see the buzz of work being done all around. If there was a truck trailer, it was either being loaded or unloaded. Not a single truck or trailer was left unattended or unused. 

Infact, every single loading bay to the warehouse was occupied and there was one truck waiting to be loaded after it. Workers scrambled throughout the yard, lift vehicles hauling crates and materials to and fro.


[1/24/2025 10:33 PM] Kaedues Staub
*Kaedues rolls his neck, feeling the tension inside relieve with the series of cracks. He opens the door with a pull of the internal lever and pushes the frame just hard enough for it to open completely. The Caliber Man steps out of the van and closes the door with a __thunk__. Once it's locked, he walks toward the workplace.*


[1/24/2025 11:42 PM] Gavyn
The G man could be seen standing on an elevated deck with a datapad. He was going over the logistics of the current operation. Unaware of Kaedues approaching him from behind.


[1/25/2025 7:01 PM] Kaedues Staub
*Kaedues comes to a stop behind the giant man. He waits for a moment in case he might turn around, but ultimately reaches forward to prod a mound of cloth he assumes to be Gavyn's shoulder.*


[1/25/2025 7:01 PM] Kaedues Staub
**"Hey."**


[1/25/2025 7:04 PM] Gavyn
Gavyn's head lifted before he turned towards the familiar voice. **"Caliber-guy! Good to see you, buddy! As you can see, we are loaded with orders."** He would hand Kaedues his tablet. **"Here, the truck in bay 5 just got here and packed from end-to-end with appliances. If you could help get that unloaded and the materials located to bay 12 for the outbound that will put us right on track for our qouta."**


[1/25/2025 7:10 PM] Kaedues Staub
*As the gofer opens his mouth to speak, his eyes scan the tablet he was held. He considers the shortest possible route from bay 5 to bay 12.*
**"Sure, I can do that. Are you having me move everything, or did you have guys already on it?"**


[1/25/2025 7:16 PM] Gavyn
**"It's all gadgets on deck. I haven't had this many employees on-shift at once in years! You'll have the help you need. Got about a dozen or so people on that truck as we speak."**


[1/25/2025 7:19 PM] Kaedues Staub
**"That's great. Thanks, Gavyn."** *With that, Kaedues hands Gavyn his tablet and walks off toward Bay 5.*
*(If I make a point of carrying the heavier appliances out of the truck, more men will be able to make round trips.)*


[1/25/2025 7:35 PM] Narration
Kaedues navigated to Bay 5 and was greeted with a myriad of forklift machines and workers attempting to coordinate their efforts toward the task. They managed to get a few large crates of appliances off the trailer. One crate had a man standing on top of it, repairing a hole created during or after the unloading process. Three others were below, looking up at the repairman.

At the bay door, a forklift was backing up out of the trailer with two spotters on each side of the door. A woman was taking stock of what was unloaded, scanning them into their inventory system. Then, there was one guy **STRUGGLING** with a dollie, the create seeming like it was too much for him to haul.


[1/25/2025 7:46 PM] Kaedues Staub
*Kaedues' boots clock silently against the pavement as he approaches the struggling group of people. His tongue darts past his lips to wet them. Before he could stop to see what's going on, he notices the workers struggling with all that weight.*
*(I think that idea's gonna work out pretty well.)*

*Kaedues raises his voice and a hand alongside it.* **"Hey! Which one of you is lead?"** *He asks. His tone is plain and neutral as always. It's difficult to tell if he's critical or curious.. or something else all together, who knows.*


[1/25/2025 8:28 PM] Narration
A few people glanced in Kaedues' direction, curious to see, 'Just who was yelling at us?' It turns out it was some red-headed guy in an aged jumpsuit. 'False alarm,' thought most of those who looked at him. They, indeed, weren't the team lead.

**"Over here!"** It was the woman with the datapad, taking stock of the inventory crossing the threshold into the warehouse. She waved a hand towards Kaedues, beckoning him to have a conversation.


[1/25/2025 8:36 PM] Kaedues Staub
*Kaedues walks over to the lady, moving past the clutter and stress around everyone here. He runs his hands through his hair.* **"I'm here to help unload this truck. I'm going to make sure you all return to normal shipping schedule."** *Kaedues gestures with his head toward the open maw of the truck and the cluster of people spotting the forklift.*

**"I can start by getting the heavier appliances safely out of the truck and onto the ground. Refrigerators, coolers... and depending on the make, gas range ovens aren't outside my limits."**


[1/25/2025 8:45 PM] Narration
The woman lowered her datapad, intrigued by Kaedues' approach. **"You? Hauling the heavier appliances with the forklift?"** She glanced over toward the man on the forklift. **"Our forklift guy uses the forklift, and we don't have spare ones. You could help that guy over there carry that appliance."** She would point with the datapad at the guy still having a blast with that crate of his.


[1/25/2025 8:47 PM] Kaedues Staub
*Kaedues shakes his head.* **"No, not with the forklift."** *He breathes in now, and as the air fills his lungs Kaedues decides that demonstrating will do a better job of selling his point. He turns around and approaches the struggling dolly man.* **"You mind if I take that off your hands?"** *He asks the guy.*

**"Phe‚Äî Huh?"** His attention was now on Kaedues. **"I don't think you could dolly this choomba. This thing is HEAVY."** He would say.


[1/25/2025 9:00 PM] Kaedues Staub
*Without properly answering the man, Kaedues steps forward. He tilts his head first to one side, and then the other. Loud pops ring out from his neck.*

*Now, the redhead grips the bottom of the crate. He uses his knuckles as leverage to prop it up, and once he slides his fingers underneath he stands straight up with the crate in tow.* **"Thanks,"** *he answers rhetorically. Now, Kaedues turns around and makes a few impactful strides in the direction of the lead he just spoke to. She may note that his expression has not changed; Not only is he carrying the crate, but without observable difficulty.*


[1/25/2025 9:08 PM] Narration
The team lead just stared at Kaedues with awe-driven confusion. Kaedues was *smaller* than that man and he was not even breaking a sweat, wheeling the damn crate to her location with ease! 

Drop. Clatter clatter.

She dropped the datapad, and she was stunned.


[1/25/2025 9:10 PM] Kaedues Staub
**"I'll get the appliances out of the truck and onto the ground?"** *Kaedues restates his earlier suggestion as a question. He shifts his posture somewhat.*


[1/25/2025 9:12 PM] Narration
The woman wordlessly nods faintly. **"....?"**


[1/25/2025 9:26 PM] Kaedues Staub
*With that, Kaedues takes a step or three backwards. He turns around and, after making sure the dolly is still in the same spot, crouches down to place the crate where it was already. His lifting form is pretty good.*

**"Okay!"** *Kaedues says loud enough for everyone to hear. He swipes his hands together a few times, possibly to upset any dust caked between his creased fingers and palms. Maybe it's just a feeling he likes. Now, the mysterious redhead tracks over to the loading bay of the truck.*

*Kaedues finds the nearest large looking crate and crouches down to pick it up. He is limited to carrying only one colossal appliance at a time, but Kaedues figures he'll make do.*


[1/25/2025 9:39 PM] Narration
As Kaedues hoisted the heavy crate, a wave of astonishment swept through the onlookers. Eyes widened and murmurs of disbelief filled the air as they marveled at his impressive strength. The sunlight glinted off the crate's surface, filtering through the skyline glass along the roof, creating a striking contrast with the grimy surroundings of the warehouse. For a brief moment, the bustling scene came to a standstill; tools dropped, conversations faded, and all eyes fixed on the figure of Kaedues. 

Yet, this moment of awe was fleeting. The initial shock quickly transformed into a ripple of excitement among the workers. They exchanged glances and shared spirited whispers, their spirits lifting as they realized that they had a true powerhouse among them. This Inspired them to push through their tasks with vigor, buoyed by the knowledge that they had someone so unassuming who could tackle the hardest of challenges.

**"Our metrics for the week are through the roof. At this rate, we'll be well in the green for a few months before the‚Äî"**


[1/25/2025 9:39 PM] Narration
Gavyn was speaking with a corpo who, unfortunately, came down to Kapea to ensure progress was being made with the lift of the lockdown. He was being guided until he saw Kaedues below on the work floor. He interrupted Gavyn, **"Who is that worker?"**


[1/25/2025 9:39 PM] Gavyn
**"‚ÄîUh, oh that? That's the Caliber-Guy."** Waddling beside the corpo.


[1/25/2025 9:39 PM] Narration
**"Is he a team lead?"** The Corpo looked towards Gavyn.


[1/25/2025 9:39 PM] Gavyn
**"N-no... He's someone I commission from time to time. He does great work‚Äî"**


[1/25/2025 9:39 PM] Narration
**"Come with me."** The Corpo was already moving away from the skywalk and going down into the offices.


[1/25/2025 9:39 PM] Gavyn
**"I‚Äî uh.. ok."** He would follow after his boss. Unsure of what this could entail.

GAVYN NOOOOOO


[1/25/2025 9:48 PM] Kaedues Staub
*With his now coworkers in high spirits, Kaedues does what he does best. In order to most effectively unload the truck, he'd have to coordinate his movements with the other people. From his now figurehead like position, he more or less had the say-so to call dibs on the heaviest stuff (and no one particularly likes having to lift that stuff anyway).*

*With a lot of movement and a little communication, the items should be unloaded from the truck in record time. With that out of the way, using dollies and forkifts and the like would be a stretch easier.*


[1/25/2025 11:33 PM] Narration
The route that Kaedues took was one of efficiency. The crew could focus more effectively on dock layout and sorting by focusing on the more prominent objects. Enabling a separate crew to begin taking the accounted cargo across the facility to the 12th Bay.

Within 40 minutes, they were able to unload the truck completely, with inventory logged.


[1/26/2025 12:41 PM] Narration
With Kaedues setting down the last of the appliances, the team he was working with began to all migrate towards Bay 12.

The forklift driver that helped unload the truck came back around and picked up the last bulk.


[1/26/2025 12:53 PM] Kaedues Staub
*Kaedues takes a breath after the team begins to move the product to the other bay. He raises his arms behind his head and leans once in either direction to loosen himself up, punctuated with a relieved groan the likes of which makes Kaedues' eyelids flutter.*
**"I did sit a while today,"** *he comments to himself.*

*With his muscles and tendons loose and ready, the redhead nabs two dollies and two crates. Moving two crates of this size and weight by hand is iffy for Kaedues, but with a dolly he can do it. He takes the largest of them he can find, likely housing refrigerators, props them up with the dollies, and begins to move toward Bay 12. A few steps in, he furrows his brow and looks behind him at one of the set of wheels.*

*(Where's the give?)*
*He tugs at the dolly on his left. He feels it, something almost invisible to anyone who'd be hauling something like this around. There's a little hitch in one of the wheels. It isn't enough to say topple the dolly, but with every rotation it makes an annoying bump.*
*Kaedues just breathes out and pretends not to notice. He moves forward, carrying the cargo over to Bay 12.*


[1/26/2025 1:20 PM] Narration
Kaedues made it to Bay 12 within a few minutes, giving scale to the warehouse and a sizable operation. Once he arrived at the designated bay, the truck doors were open, and the team lead briefed everyone on what needed to be done. Looking down at her datapad, she reviewed the best way to load these items.

**"Solid hustle, crew. If we keep this momentum, we can blitz this rig out before the clock hits 10. Let‚Äôs ride the wave and make it happen. This shipment‚Äôs got a mega trek ahead, so we‚Äôll be stacking these appliances on pallets, yeah? We gotta play it smart‚Äîget the heavy pallets rigged up towards the core of the rig, while the lightweights chill out in the front and back like they own the place. Gotta keep it balanced and tight, or we'll be getting rings at 4am about a tipped rig."** 

How do you get the appliances on the metal pallets? It seems easy enough. Plus, it would make the forklifts far more helpful, as they could take multiple stacked items at once into the truck. Warehouse workers knew exactly what to do, shuffling appliances near the edge of the pallets and laying them down across their length and width.


[1/26/2025 1:27 PM] Narration
**"Ah, deck it, my forklift is stuck!"** Exclaimed one of the *certified* forklift drivers. The back wheel found itself in a divot in the concrete, preventing the driver from being able to move. Thankfully, he did not have a payload on his forks. However, what that did mean was that they were down a forklift.

Several workers rallied to the forklift driver's call, assessing the situation for themselves. The divot was deep. Had it been shallow, then pushing the forklift out would have been easy. But they were dealing with something they'd have to get creative to manage.


[1/26/2025 1:38 PM] Kaedues Staub
*Kaedues stops in place and sets the dollies upright before sliding them out from underneath the crates. He looks over to where he heard the exclamation... and the situation seems obvious enough.*

*(If we're down a forklift, we'll be working slower. I know a few ways to fix this, but I'll have to make it quick. Dumping a lot of time into recovering this could, worst case scenario, set us back anyway.)*

*Kaedues walks over to the forklift quietly and crouches down to take a look at the hole in the ground. Safe to say that at least half of the tire would be sunk if the ditch is considered deep. On average, a forklift weighs somewhere around 9,000 lbs. There's no way that even Kaedues could lift it even an inch off the ground. Hell, not even another forklift of the same size could lift it.*

*The redhead takes a good look at the tire, and especially the frame of the vehicle surrounding the tire. He rests his elbows on his knees..*


[1/26/2025 1:46 PM] Narration
The wheel well had lots of clearance away from the wheel. You could stick one's head between the body and the wheel. Towards the bottom of the wheel well, the corners were rounded off with beveled edges. A good 40% of the wheel was caught in the divot, and both rear tires were caught in this long divot.

**"Yo, there‚Äôs no way we‚Äôre gonna get this forklift outta here."** One of the employee's surmised.


[1/26/2025 2:02 PM] Kaedues Staub
*(I thought I'd be able to wedge a pipe or something in here to let the wheel roll itself out, but the wheel well's an odd shape. Doubt I'd find a big enough pipe in time to actually fix anything, anyway.)*

*Kaedues turns to the front of the lift. It's __not carrying a payload__..*
*He stands up, and calls to someone returning from making a trip.* **"Hey, we need a pallet,"** *He states and gestures toward the sunken forklift.* **"You think you can bring one over?"**

*After he asks the question, his eyes dart around.*
*(If this goes well, I won't need a ramp.. but I might as well look.)*


[1/26/2025 3:09 PM] Narration
**"Yeah, sure thing. Let me get you one."** An employee replied, briskly walking away to find an unused pallet.

The warehouse was filled with equipment and, most importantly, inventory. Crates and boxes were stacked almost to the ceiling. Skylift cranes remained dormant, unused for months or even years. Crews populated the other bays, and stragglers sprinkled throughout the entire facility.


[1/26/2025 3:31 PM] Kaedues Staub
*In the mean time, Kaedues makes a short walk back to the crates he was hauling earlier. With the use of the dollies, he brings the crates over to the forklift.*
**"I got an idea,"** *he announces.* **"We're gonna try and prop it up."**


[1/26/2025 5:47 PM] Narration
The one individual who went to fetch the pallet returned to the forklift. Could you set it down and wait for more instructions? The forklift driver was puzzled as to what Keadues meant by propping. **"Prop it? You really think it‚Äôs gonna vibe?"** The driver asked doubtively.


[1/26/2025 6:07 PM] Kaedues Staub
**"With the forklift outfitted with the pallet, we can give it a payload and shift its center of balance forward. With enough weight, it should raise the back tire out of the hole,"** *Kaedues answers.*

*His arms fold together.*


[1/26/2025 6:25 PM] Narration
A few employees mouthed an "o" and realized Kaedues' line of thinking. They positioned the pallet in front of the forklift, slid it onto the forks, and began stacking equipment onto the pallet. Redistributing the weight of the forklift towards the front (which had the actual drive-train).

Once they determined that the pallets had sufficient weight, the forklift driver would raise the pallet a few feet, enabling the weight distribution to shift. Then, he would accelerate. The back wheels lifted out of the divot and landed on the flat surface. Many people clapped while others cheered. With that obstacle cleared, productivity resumed at full capacity.


[1/26/2025 6:38 PM] Kaedues Staub
:OKaedues:


[1/26/2025 6:39 PM] Kaedues Staub
*Kaedues returns to his prior objective where he was just movin' crates with dollies. He'd keep it up just like that too.*


[1/26/2025 7:02 PM] Narration
Once again, with Kaedues expertly operating the dollies, the rest of the work was straightforward. The loading process was smooth, aside from the few times they had to unload a few pallets to reorganize the trailer. Before they knew it, the truck in Bay 12 was loaded and was on its way through the warehouse lot and onto the road.

Team members gave each other high fives and told each other how good of a job they did. The clock hit 10, and the work bell began to chime, signifying to everyone that the day was over.  Excited chatter between co-workers emerged as they began to disperse, handling last minute tasks before moving to clock out.


[1/26/2025 7:29 PM] Kaedues Staub
*As the minutes to clocking out grow sooner and sooner, Kaedues finds himself doing increasingly more menial tasks. Right now, he's performing an oil change on one of the forklifts. Actually, he's just getting done. After screwing in a standardized oil filter, Kaedues crabwalks his way out from underneath the forklift and brings the oil pan with him. The pan is full of a strange almost liquid substance that's blacker than tar and almost as thick. Was that the oil?*


[1/26/2025 7:41 PM] Narration
When Kaedues emerged from the forklift, it felt like someone had dimmed the lights in the warehouse. Nope! It was just Gavyn standing there, his frame completely blocking the ceiling lights from reaching him.


[1/26/2025 7:41 PM] Gavyn
**"Caliber-Guy, I was looking for you."** He stated. He wipes his hands of grease with a towel. **"Had to ask around to see if you were still here."**


[1/26/2025 7:43 PM] Kaedues Staub
*Kaedues punches the air, using the force to propel himself into a sitting position instead of a laying one. Now, the redhead's attention is on his larger-than-life friend.*

**"Just wrapping up. What can I do for you?"**


[1/26/2025 7:57 PM] Gavyn
While Gavyn spoke, he would stuff the towel in a pocket and unattached his datapad from a clip on his vest. **"I had one of our Corpo managers inspect our productivity while you were working."** While he waited for the datapad to boot up, Gavyn continued, **"He had nothing but good things to say about you, man."** When the screen came on, he held it with both hands and occasionally removed one hand to make gestures. **"I know you already have a job and whatnot. But, he insisted that we extend a permanent job offer to you."**


[1/26/2025 7:59 PM] Kaedues Staub
**"...Huh. Did the guy mention an hourly pay?"** *Kaedues brings himself to his feet as he asks the question.*


[1/26/2025 8:08 PM] Gavyn
**"Well, I get to set the wages. I recall a conversation with you about 26/hr. We start new employees at 13, but knowing you, I can accommodate 26 an hour."** Gavyn said, stepping back and allowing Kaedues room to stand.


[1/26/2025 8:09 PM] Gavyn
**"Though, I don't want you to think you have to quit your existing job and all..."**


[1/26/2025 8:16 PM] Kaedues Staub
*Kaedues thinks long and hard about the offer. It's a little better than his last job, actually.*
**"That's more than I was going to ask for,"** *he comments.* **"An offer for a full-time position.. Lucky for you, I'm already out of my other job. No need to worry about that."**


[1/26/2025 8:20 PM] Kaedues Staub
**"Sounds reliable. I do need the micros."** *In this moment, some fleeting forethought is completely discarded. Full-time position is go.*
**"Tell me about the work. How many days on? Overtime? Holidays?"** *He asks rapid-fire!*


[1/26/2025 8:24 PM] Gavyn
**"Uhem, yeah. So, we generally work 4 days a week 12-hour shifts with overtime required when we fall behind on shipments. We don't get holidays, unfortunately."** He'd lift his hat, revealing a receding hairline as he scratched an itch.


[1/26/2025 8:25 PM] Gavyn
**"Turnover is pretty high, and I will start you off as a team member. Since I know you kick ass, promotions are likely."**


[1/26/2025 8:37 PM] Kaedues Staub
**"I could work full-time with those hours. Need to know what kind of promotions we're talking about though,"** *Kaedues replies.* **"I know my skill set. Been with a few employers before that liked to promote just because it looked good to the rest of the crew."**


[1/26/2025 8:52 PM] Gavyn
**"I try to give raises quarterly. It really depends on whether the corporation approves funding proposals. If you were to get promotions from me, you could be a team leader and, beyond that, would be a coach. If you want to specialize in maintenance, shipping, or driving coach. Anything beyond that would have to come from corporate."**


[1/26/2025 8:57 PM] Kaedues Staub
**"Alright. I can work with that."** *Kaedues nods.* **"The pay is better, and you're offering promotions. Seems better than what I had before."** *His fingers ball up and then release.* **"Do you want to go through with this the formal way?"**


[1/26/2025 9:07 PM] Gavyn
**"Well, since I would need to do paperwork, we would have to do this the more formal way. For Loft Logistics, we have our offices in Jansville. I'll be giving you a permit so that you can move freely between Haven Heights and Fairview. You'll need to apply there and with the permit comes __my manager's__ recommendation. You'll be ready to start next week at the latest."** He'd transfer the information to Kaedues. The location of the offices, the hours in which they are open. The position Gavyn is offering and so fourth.


[1/26/2025 9:10 PM] Kaedues Staub
**"I'll make the application tomorrow."** *Kaedues nods without another gesture at all.* **"Is there anything else?"**


[1/26/2025 9:14 PM] Gavyn
**"Nope! That is all, really."** He wired 208 Micros to his account for the two hours he worked. (Practically paying him 8 hours). **"It's the end of our workweek, so I'll see you in 3 days."**


[1/26/2025 9:23 PM] Kaedues Staub
**"Thanks again, then. See you around."**
*With that, Kaedues begins the walk back to his van. He waves to Gavyn as he departs from the guy's space.*


[1/26/2025 9:28 PM] Gavyn
He would wave Kaedues goodbye!


[1/26/2025 9:29 PM] Kaedues Staub
*A subtle smile crosses his lips, showing his excitement in earnest. It's good to be employed again, even if the vacancy wasn't particularly long.*

*He climbs into the front seat. With a push into the ignition and a turn, the van hums to life.*
*(26 an hour.. With that kind of money.. well, actually there isn't much for me to do with the excess.)* *Kaedues sighs. He pulls out of the lot and begins his drive toward the stacks.*

[1/30/2025 9:06 PM] Narration
Kaedues was drawing closer to the bustling border between Haven Heights and Fairview, an area alive with the sounds of engines and the chatter of walking travelers. The traffic was thick, with vehicles lined up in three primary lanes, while the fourth lane, reserved for emergency vehicles, remained clear and unobstructed. It was a typical scene at the border, where the anticipation of entering Fairview mingled with the impatience of the waiting motorists.  It was estimated to take 10 to 20 minutes to be processed as the diligent border officials moved methodically, ensuring that everyone passed through safely and within regulation. The air was charged with frustration as each vehicle inched toward the checkpoint.

However, the CCR was **NOT** overseeing the checkpoint. The soldiers present were the same ones Kaedues had observed patrolling near Shop 1113, their expressions were obscured by the cybernetics they possessed. A formidable new vehicle loomed at the checkpoint, towering even above the massive semi-trailer trucks. These bi-pedal war machines exuded an intimidating presence, every detail meticulously designed for oppression. The cockpit glass shimmered with a dark, glossy finish, a one-way barrier that rendered the interior imperceptible to curious onlookers.

This machine was equipped with a fearsome mini-gun that echoed the powerful armament of the Photon Falcon. Alongside the second arm, a series of pods and tubes were strategically aligned, hinting at advanced weaponry systems and tactical capabilities. The chassis swayed side to side occassionally, continually scanning the chaotic scene of the bustling border, its sensors poised to detect any hint of disturbance.

*As Kaedues approaches the checkpoint, his face pinches a little and he learns forward in shock. Seeing them before was a little unsettling, but seeing them here, like this?*

*It blooms into fruition a feeling within Him. That feeling itches him. It is like-- no, it __is__ the feeling of barbed wires anchoring themself into his grey matter.*
**"Mm-mm."** *Kaedues says dismissively and moves to turn the van around entirely and drive away from the checkpoint. He is left with an infuriatingly vague feeling, one he does not know the origin or meaning of.*


[1/30/2025 10:20 PM] Sophie Donovan
Sophie is partially confused by this action, looking in the rearview mirror as the checkpoint grows further away. Her glance then transfered towards Kaedues to get a read on him...


[1/30/2025 10:24 PM] Kaedues Staub
*Kaedues' expression is particularly focused on the rearview mirrors as well as he pulls away from the area.*
*Without warning, his eyes lock with hers.. through the rearview mirror. He does not turn his head towards her at all.*
**"Have you ever seen a checkpoint outfitted with that?"** *He asks out loud.*


[1/30/2025 10:47 PM] Sophie Donovan
**"Not really. Neon Kyrie is the closest I have seen to that."** She murmured. **"I never really understood __why__ this is all happening. No one does."**


[1/31/2025 11:08 AM] Kaedues Staub
**"I am in the same boat as you. I saw tanks rolling down the road outside one of my old job sites. My guess is, the CCR is deploying its military force."** *Kaedues rolls the van down a few familiar straight roads in Kapea for now.* **"It might not actually be related, but since you have agreed to the arrangement I offered.."** *His eyes glance toward Sophie for a moment.* **"You should know everything."**

*Kaedues pauses for a moment.* **"Hearing this kind of information at your age and position may put your soundness of mind at risk for the foreseeable future. For that reason, I need you to confirm with me whether or not you are ready to hear everything I know."**
*The air that fills his lungs feels tense.. dry.*

**"I'm confident that being snatched in the middle of the night is far more traumatizing than what you have to say."** She replied, looking back towards her side of the van.


[1/31/2025 8:07 PM] Kaedues Staub
*They have a solid 20 or so minutes before reaching the stacks, Kaedues figures. He feels urged, pressured to toss his feelings to the side and focus on the road, on checking the mirrors, on keeping track of the cars. He wills himself to ignore the feeling.*

**"I will start from the beginning, so you have the same amount of information I do."** *Kaedues states before he begins.* **"This all began around a week and a half ago. I worked at Shop 1113."**

*Kaedues' eyes scan the environment in front of them, making sure to follow all road regulations and speed limits. He grips the steering wheel a little tighter, but after a moment he becomes conscious of it and loosens his fingers again.*
**"I had met someone. A coworker. She worked in the shop as well."** *Kaedues' cheek rises uncomfortably.* **"Don't know why, but I had to find out more about her. There's something strange about her."**


[1/31/2025 8:25 PM] Kaedues Staub
*He pauses a moment, as if to allow Sophie the room to comment. When she doesn't, Kaedues opens his mouth to speak again. The sounds of the outside world muffle, allowing his breath to be audible along with the purring of the van's restored engine.*

**"I offered to take her to the building you agreed to meet with me at. To climb it. She did it the easy way, just using the ladders. Once we got to the top..."** *He trails off for a fraction of a moment. Seeing his cybernetic hand pulls him away from the story he was telling.* **"Sorry.. that's not right."** *He hesitates to continue.* **"I was responsible for a head-on collision on the ride there,"** *Kaedues explains, as if dropping a live grenade on the floor.*

**"I lost my hand. She was airlifted, I believe, before I even woke up. Once I could think straight, I decided to call Danny for help."**

**"He took me to a hospital, where I was treated, and then home. I don't remember why, but he changed his mind on letting me stay home. He actually picked me up and carried me to his car."**

**"..anyway, I was taken to Fairview."** *Kaedues' grip tightens just a little further.* **"Among other things, I happened to be approached by a woman, a worker for the CCR who was asking about Danny. I was lucky that she was called in to work before I was jailed."**

*As Kaedues approaches an upcoming intersection, he's cut off by an impatient driver. The light turns red before either of them can get anywhere, though. A little smirk appears on the redhead's face.*
**"So I went back to his condo and explained all of that to him. He stressed out over it, and then called an associate of his. Fred Dawson, the father of the girl I hospitalized. Dan created an inconspicuous situation to meet up with Fred, and I was brought along because I was.. concerned."** *The sound of Kaedues clearing his throat reverberates through the entire vehicle.*


[1/31/2025 8:59 PM] Kaedues Staub
**"He began to explain his situation to Fred in detail, or at least he tried to. Someone who called himself Rhett interrupted the conversation."**
*Kaedues' eyes narrow, pupils dilate ever so slightly as he combs through the events in his head.* **"Another CCR employ. The way he carried himself gives away his rank. He was accompanied by guards. Fred Dawson had come armed to the hospital. Instead of drawing his own arms, Rhett ordered the man to give it over."**

*Kaedues' voice grows subtly louder, his vocal tones creeping toward his throat.*

[1/31/2025 8:59 PM] Kaedues Staub
**"I think I am a good judge of character. Fred Dawson is reluctant to trust others. Like you, he thinks going solo is less complicated. He is the kind of person who would never give up his arm. But he did. He had no choice to."** *Kaedues shakes his head. He feels a warping of the brain, a mysterious feeling as if his thoughts are travelling like sound through water.*

**"He held her at gunpoint. With his own fucking gun! __He forced that man onto the ground, made him beg for her life like a tenant who was a year late on rent!__"** *Kaedues' hands grip the steering wheel as hard as they can. The wheel itself warps somewhat under the stress, crying out in agony within his grip.* **"While I work my ass off paycheck to', __that__ fuck gets to be escorted around by his pair of boyfriends and coast off of __MY FUCKING TAX COMMISSION!"__**


[1/31/2025 9:04 PM] Kaedues Staub
*Kaedues strangles a hold on his character and comes to his senses for just long enough to check his mirrors, and check his surroundings, and pull over to the side of the road. During that time, he says nothing and leaves the space of the van in a tense silence. It's enough time for him to properly collect his thoughts.*


[1/31/2025 9:22 PM] Sophie Donovan
Sophie stays silent as Kaedues talks, staring out the window but not seeing anything. The neon-lit streets blur past in a haze of rain-slick pavement and pulsing advertisements, but her mind is elsewhere‚Äîhalf on his words, half on the strange weight pressing against her chest.

She doesn't know this guy. Not really. Her father trusts him enough to meet up, having him stay at their home, but from where she's sitting, Kaedues is... unhinged. Or, at the very least, combustible. She noticed it the beat she laid eyes on him. The way he holds himself too tightly makes it seem like he's continuously trying to keep his thoughts from plunging open. Now, as he grips the wheel hard enough to make the metal groan, she's sure.

Sophie doesn't withdraw, but her body tenses like she's bracing for something. A strike, maybe? Her hands curl into fists in her lap, nails pressing into the fabric of her pants. She wants to shift away, to estrange herself and whatever this is.

It was like he was fulminating‚Äîvexation lacing every word, every movement. She should communicate something, maybe. Call him out, calm him down, anything. But what would she even say? *"Hey, don't get all crazy while I'm in the car with you?"* Like that would avail.


[1/31/2025 9:22 PM] Sophie Donovan
She settles for staying hushed, trying to fade into the environment of red that he was seeing. That's always been her best bet in situations like this. *She was all too familiar*. Individuals like Kaedues don't need her input, anyway. They need something to fight against, something to hate. Right now, it's the CCR. The tax system. That Rhett guy. Rhett: Keep that name in mind.

But what happens when there's no target left? What if he *snaps*? She's seen when a person splinters, and there is no medium. They'll find the most effortless and instantaneous venue to alleviate that.

When he finally pulls over, the van is quiet, and the silence feels too thick, too dense, like the inside of a sealed can. Sophie stares at the dashboard, trying to slow her breathing before she says something she'll regret.

Because right now, the last thing she wants is for his attention to turn to her.

Sophie keeps her gaze low, but it's in his direction. Not enough to make eye contact‚Äîjust enough to watch, to track every little movement he makes. His fingers flexing the wheel makes it seem like they don't trust themselves‚Äîthe way his breathing shifts, uneven, trying to smooth itself out but never quite getting there. Inner Demons?

She doesn't want to meet his eyes. She doesn't want to be caught looking, to give him even the slightest excuse to drag her into whatever storm is brewing in his head. But she **is watching**, because she needs to. Because she's in this van, stuck in his space, and knowing what he's about to do before he does, it might be her only absolute control.

He's dangerous. Maybe not to her, but it's there, under the surface. Something frayed, something barely held together.

Being with this man was a **mistake**.


[1/31/2025 9:38 PM] Kaedues Staub
*He hadn't even realized that the feeling he let out was welling within him, but he did release it. Now its eyes pan to Sophie again, assessing her.*

*The red-headed man takes a shallow breath in, and then out. It allows itself to settle before another beat can rest. Then, it talks. It's stern, cold and calculated like he has been up until this point-- no, more than that.*

**"That wasn't supposed to happen. You're owed an apology,"** *It states, but its tone sounds completely detached.* **"Rhett came to inform Dan and Fred that Paige Underwood and what I assume to be her associate were still alive. He has power and influence and used it during that conversation to present both of them with an ultimatum that would force them to take action."**


[1/31/2025 9:53 PM] Kaedues Staub
**"They are currently both tasked with executing this Paige character. If either your father or Dawson does kill her, they will be killed."** *Its eyes stay glued to Sophie, uncaring of the consequences that come from telling this girl all of this.* **"If they do not, Rhett will see to it that their families are killed."**

*His dark voids seek eye contact, following Sophie's where ever she looks like intrusive probes. It doesn't bother waiting for her response.*
**"When I left the hospital with Dan, I was informed that he used to belong to a terrorist group called Horizon Grey. Rhett approached him, Fred, and an associate named Kode. In exchange for enough information to take out the organization, they and their families were given witness protection."**

*Its calm and relaxed facial expressions contrast starkly with his earlier outburst.*
**"I returned to the condo Danny lives in. The next morning, I was briefed about Danny's plans moving forward. You and the rest of your family are to be taken out of the district, where your father likely believes you will be safer."**


[1/31/2025 10:05 PM] Sophie Donovan
Sophie doesn‚Äôt react at first. She just sits there, frozen, as Kaedues‚Äî**or whatever he is now**‚Äîlays it all out like he‚Äôs reading off a grocery list

Her father. ***A terrorist.**
Her father. **Marked for death.**
Her father. **Killing people out to keep her and the rest of them alive.**

The words echo in her head, stacking on top of each other like collapsing buildings, crushing any logical response she might‚Äôve had. She knew something was wrong‚Äîhad known for a while. The way Danny moved, the way he acted, the way he never gave her a straight answer. But this? This?

She forces her breathing to stay even. Don‚Äôt panic. Don‚Äôt give him **anything**. But inside, it feels like the ground is shifting beneath her. Her hands retract into the sleeves of her jacket. Just enough to mask that her nails were near the point of drawing blood from her grim textured palms. She allowed herself to slip once before this man. Don't let it happen again.

She can feel Kaedues‚Äô stare, drilling into her like a machine scanning for a weakness, a fault line. He‚Äôs watching too closely. Reading too much. He‚Äôs looking for something, and she doesn‚Äôt want to give it to him.

**Say something.**

She doesn‚Äôt want to. She wants to get out of this van. She wants to be anywhere but here, but she knows running won‚Äôt do anything. She knows Kaedues‚Äîwill just run her down like a **dog**.

Her voice comes out quieter than she wants, but steady.
**"So that‚Äôs it?"** She finally meets his gaze, locking eyes with him despite every nerve in her body telling her not to. **"He‚Äôs just‚Ä¶ forced into this? No way out? We are just doomed to be killed in the end?"**

She doesn‚Äôt know what she expects him to say. Some part of her knows the answer already. There‚Äôs no running from people like this. No escaping something you already signed your name to.


[1/31/2025 10:21 PM] Kaedues Staub
*That thing backs away from Sophie, a fraction of an inch away. It tilts its head a few degrees to one side quizzically. In the hours that take place during those few moments, its eyes look through her, past her, considering something else completely.*

**"No."** *Its eyes track back onto hers.* **"He is in a world made by humans. Owned by humans. Ran by humans."** *It states coldly.* **"The cities you build, the organizations you make, the strategies you employ are limited by the scope of your knowledge and the scope of the reasons why you choose to live."**

*Now, it slowly turns toward the windshield.* **"Those things can be exploited to ensure your personal success. In fact, the question of whether or not you can escape this situation is completely irrelevant. You waste valuable space in your data block by thinking this way. Only think of how to do it. Do not stop until you reach where you need to be."**


[1/31/2025 10:36 PM] Sophie Donovan
Sophie watches as he‚Äîit‚Äîshifts away, just barely. The movement is minor, almost meaningless, but somehow it makes her stomach twist. Like watching something not quite human trying to mimic a reaction it doesn‚Äôt actually feel.

And then it tilts its head, just slightly. Calculating.
Not like someone thinking through an answer.
More like something running a process.

Her breath hitches, just for a second, before she forces it back under control.

When it finally speaks, the words send a chill through her. No.
Not I don‚Äôt know. Not Maybe. Just No. Flat. Final. Absolute.

And then it keeps talking, but the words barely feel directed at her anymore. They‚Äôre cold, dissected, like a machine explaining a function. Like she‚Äôs the one who doesn‚Äôt get it.

She should feel angry. Maybe she does. Somewhere, buried under the creeping unease, there‚Äôs a sharp edge of frustration curling in her chest. But mostly, she feels sick.

Because he‚Äôs not wrong.

She knows it. Some part of her has always known it‚Äîthe world isn‚Äôt fair. It never was. It doesn‚Äôt care about who deserves what. It doesn‚Äôt care about right and wrong. It‚Äôs just a system, built by people who clawed their way to the top and made sure no one else could follow.

She changed the topic entirely. **"Where are you taking me now?"**


[1/31/2025 10:52 PM] Kaedues Staub
**"I will drive to Littleton and purchase a sleeping bag for you to use. I will then drive you to my house."** *It pauses for a brief moment.* **"Considering the stress you are showing, I will allow you to leave the area and do what you want."**
*The red-head presses its foot on the gas and smoothly veers back onto the road toward Littleton, calm and collected.*
**"Convene at my place every day at midnight, and do not leave the Stacks. Once I teach you what I promised, you'll be allowed to go where ever you want."**


[1/31/2025 10:58 PM] Kaedues Staub
**"There are a number of legitimate reasons for you to use the house as shelter. If it would have you use the space, I will sleep in the van."** *The weight of the van shifts only slightly as Kaedues makes a turn down one of Kapea's streets.*
**"I will not bother insisting. I know how you think anyway. Just keep yourself alive."** *He finishes.*


[2/1/2025 1:53 PM] Sophie Donovan
Sophie doesn‚Äôt say a word. She just watches the road ahead, her fingers still curled into her sleeves, having found equilibrium with her thoughts. He‚Äôs planning for her, arranging her next moves like she‚Äôs a piece in a game she never agreed to play. But the worst part is that he isn‚Äôt wrong.

She needed closure on what was going on. To do this, she needed to stay alive.

And Kaedues‚Äîwhatever he is, whatever he‚Äôs turning into‚Äîknows that. He‚Äôs already predicted how she‚Äôll react, already factored in her resistance before she‚Äôs even had the chance to argue.

He says he won‚Äôt insist‚Äîbut he doesn't **have** to. People have a weird way of going back on their word. However she knows she‚Äôll go along with it, for now. After all, its about keeping yourself alive.


[2/1/2025 1:58 PM] Kaedues Staub
*The drive to Littleton is quiet from then on. As they approach the area, its movements stop being so perfectly calculated. Whether it is returning to norm, or remembering the patterns it used to take is indistinguishable..*


[2/1/2025 1:59 PM] Narration
Continuing @ https://discord.com/channels/1106367747727835206/1108810672541806622/1335323485173579826


[3/23/2025 1:22 AM] Narration
Kaedues approaches the place in which he gets his gyros. Considering it was early in the morning, the place wasn't as busy as it normally is. Which would serve to benefit them when it comes to serve time.

Kaedues entered the parking lot and Sophie looked around, as she usually does as a passenger.


[3/23/2025 1:26 AM] Kaedues Staub
*Kaedues exits the van. He locks it before he leaves, and waits for Sophie to meet up with him before properly entering the food joint.*
**"When I came here last, there was a line that stretched outside. Good thing we came early."**


[3/23/2025 1:27 AM] Sophie Donovan
**"Oh. Then it must be good."** Sophie briskly made it to his side before mirroring his pace, raising her shoulders so the collar of the jacket broke the early morning draft.


[3/23/2025 1:31 AM] Kaedues Staub
**"It is good,"** *Kaedues affirms. He approaches the counter and raises a hand to greet the man behind it.* **"I'll have a gyro, thanks. The regular kind."** *Now his eyes track momentarily down to Sophie to get her input..* **"You want a copy of my order?"**


[3/23/2025 1:39 AM] Narration
The man behind the counter nods and turns around to prepare the order. He looks like anyone else might at this hour‚Äîtired, mildly courteous, running on autopilot. To Kaedues, he‚Äôs just another part of the morning routine. Nothing remarkable.


[3/23/2025 1:39 AM] Sophie Donovan
But Sophie lingers. Her gaze rests on the man a little longer than it should. Maybe it‚Äôs the way he didn‚Äôt blink when Kaedues spoke, or how his posture stayed a little too still‚Äîlike he was waiting rather than working.

She doesn‚Äôt say anything right away. Just narrows her eyes slightly, as if trying to piece something together but not bothering to ask the puzzle its name. Then, just as quickly, she shrugs it off. Could be nothing. Could be lack of sleep.

**"You said regular, right?"** she mutters, hands stuffed in her jacket pockets. Her voice is steady, but her eyes flick back toward the counter‚Äîjust once‚Äîbefore settling on Kaedues. **"What comes on it again?"**


[3/23/2025 1:45 AM] Kaedues Staub
*He notices her looking, but doesn't make much of it. She's never been in here before, or ordered a gyro, or worked with food workers in Haven heights at all. Makes sense to be cautious, if even that.*

**"Regular.. It's prepared with lamb meat, feta cheese, tzatziki sauce and hummus. Wrapped with pita bread."**
*It sounded like he had finished his sentence, but he adds something on last second.* **"That's just what you start with, though. Add some vegetables or other condiments if you feel like it."**


[3/23/2025 1:49 AM] Narration
Within 30 seconds, the food was ready, wrapped and bagged for Kaedues to take from the employee. **"21.00, please."**

There was that same pay kiosk sitting on top of the counter which allows customers to pay for their food seamlessly.


[3/23/2025 1:51 AM] Kaedues Staub
**"Ah, yeah. Thanks."** *Kaedues pays 21 micros to the kiosk, and takes his bag. He looks toward Sophie again expectantly...*


[3/23/2025 1:59 AM] Sophie Donovan
Sophie steps forward, eyes briefly locked on the man‚Äôs hand as he passes over the bag. For the briefest second, the man‚Äôs eyes flicker to her. Not in a threatening way. Not exactly. But there‚Äôs a stillness in it‚Äîlike he‚Äôs recognizing something, or remembering her from somewhere she‚Äôs never been.

She backs away from the counter and huffs through her nose as she heads for the door to leave not sparing another moment.
-# "Weird vibes..."


[3/23/2025 2:01 AM] Kaedues Staub
*Kaedues walks out of the store with Sophie. The assumption of her reason is enough of one to leave in the first place. Though, when they do exit, he properly asks..*
**"What was that?"**


[3/23/2025 2:06 AM] Sophie Donovan
Sophie doesn‚Äôt answer right away. She kicks a loose pebble on the sidewalk, watching it bounce off the curb. Her brows are faintly drawn, but she hides it behind her usual tone.
**"I dunno. Something about him felt off."**

She folds her arms, more to center herself than for warmth. **"It was creepy, he reminded me of you when we first formally met. Like he was reading a digital novel, and I walked in during the part he didn't want anyone to see."**

A beat passes. She snorts, rolling her eyes at herself. **"Whatever. Probably just hungry."**

But even as she says it, she glances once more over her shoulder‚Äîjust in case the man is still watching.


[3/23/2025 2:06 AM] Narration
In this case, the man was not watching, he was adjecent to the counter, working on more orders beyind the counter. Chopping away.


[3/23/2025 2:10 AM] Kaedues Staub
**"You're being delusional. I was far more incriminating."** *He states plainly and looks away from Sophie in a way that could almost be.. aloof? Sarcastic?*

*In any case, he holds his bag out to Sophie.* **"Here."**


[3/23/2025 2:23 AM] Sophie Donovan
Sophie scoffs, loud and dramatic. **"Wow, thanks for the psychiatric evaluation, Dr. Kaedues."** She took the bag and began walking back towards the van. **"I'm __so__ sorry my senses got in the way of your grand performance as 'Suspicious Choom #1' back there."**

Then, a pause. A quieter tone follows, not quite soft, but less performative. **"Look, I *know* it sounds stupids. Maybe it __is__ stupid. But it didn't feel like nothing."**

She glances at him sidelong. **"You get the feeling where someone looks at you like they know something you don't? Like they're already halfway through a conversation you didn't get invited t‚Äî"** Before she finishes her thought. The snark starts creeping back in. **"Forget it, you can be the main character. if it helps you sleep. The guy had NPC energy."** Pointing her finger at him pointedly. **"Maybe you were more incriminating. But he felt more...intentional. Let's just get out of here, please?"**


[3/23/2025 1:34 PM] Kaedues Staub
*Kaedues more just observes her when she snaps back at him. The way her tone shifts from defensive to.. something else, something confused or--maybe-- vulnerable.* **"That's uncharacteristic of you."** *He comments out loud and turns to look for a moment at the person running the cash register. After just a glance, he walks toward the van and gestures for her to follow.*

**"My comment was a joke. If you're serious, then I'll listen. You talk like someone who believes they are right. You're listening to a hunch?"**


[3/23/2025 7:33 PM] Sophie Donovan
Kaedues did __not__ need to gesture for her to follow. Because, she was already glued to his side the moment he nudged in the direction. **"It's a gut feeling, one that I am not willingly going to ignore."** 

Sophie transfer the bag from one hand to the next as she reached out for the handle of the van. Ready to enter at a moment's notice.


[3/23/2025 7:55 PM] Kaedues Staub
**"You don't know why, but you know you're right?"**


[3/23/2025 8:20 PM] Kaedues Staub
*He opens the driver side door of the van, and unlocks the passenger side remotely.*


[3/23/2025 10:45 PM] Sophie Donovan
Sophie climbs into the van. Closing the door and setting the bag of food down on the dash. **"I guess you could say that."** She did not know what else to say about it. The guy was making her skin crawl in all the wrong ways. 

Though, there was a question ebbing at the far reaches of her mind... She desired validation? **"Would you believe in my hunch?"** She averted her gaze from Kaedues.


[3/23/2025 10:59 PM] Kaedues Staub
*Kaedues is next to climb in. He gets started right away on pulling out of the gyro's parking lot, but he addresses her question as soon as is appropriate.*
**"Maybe. I don't relate to the situation you compared it to.. Can you tell me another time you felt like this?"** *He states, then asks. His voice is smoother now than it might usually be. His critical way of speaking is still there, albeit mixed with his confusion in the moment.*


[3/24/2025 9:11 PM] Sophie Donovan
Sophie sank into her seat, allowing the weight of her upper body to rest heavily against the padded backrest. The old bolts securing the lower chassis groaned softly, their creaks resonating in the stillness that enveloped her. The air was thick with an anticipatory silence, a stark contrast to the whirlwind of thoughts racing through her mind as she prepared to explain herself.

She took a moment to collect her thoughts, shuffling them in a way that made sense and ordering them chronologically in her head. Throughout the process, her eyes searched beyond what was before her‚Äîreaching out into a realm only she could access. Then, Sophie looked at him with a sidelong glance. 

**"Well, for starters‚Äîyou."** The van dipped down to meet the uneven local road, jostling them with a familiar bounce as the suspension absorbed the bumps. After a brief moment, the vehicle leveled out, seamlessly integrating them into the flow of traffic. As the rhythmic motion continued, Sophie turned to gaze through the glass that separated them from the bustling world outside, her attention piqued and divided by the vibrant life passing by.

**"It's hard to put into words, you know? When I first found you in that abandoned building, I got this feeling... not just suspicion or wariness. Sure, those feels were there, but something else was beneath the surface."** 

She still hadn‚Äôt touched her food. The paper bag teetered slightly with each motion of the van, shifting with the turns and bumps. Sophie glanced his way‚Äîjust for a moment‚Äîbefore quickly returning her eyes to the world beyond the window.

**"Your eyes, your voice... they never quite match. It's not like you're hiding something, exactly. It's more like‚Äîlike you're following a script. Moving through things in a straight line without ever wondering why. And that? That‚Äôs what makes it feel... unnatural."** Her brow furrowed harshly, and her voice lowered, more to herself than anyone else. **"Like you're being piloted."**


[3/24/2025 9:11 PM] Sophie Donovan
A chill ran along her arms. Androids‚Äîsure, there were plenty of models that mimicked human behavior, even tried to be personable. But those damn things didn't feel or act as sophisticated Kaedues. There are thoughts, there are emotions... She thought. Besides, they aren't autonomous in that way... Or she believes.

**"I've been trying to shake it, this feeling, but I can‚Äôt.  Even before you got mad, I kept circling back to it. When we talked about that... separation, remember? The driving metaphor‚Äîit was more of a warning bell in my head."** 

She shifted, suddenly uncomfortable, and double-checked her seatbelt.

-# shuuuuun‚Äîclick!

With a clipped motion, she secured it, and her eyes quickly darted outside, anchoring herself to the world beyond the cabin.

**"That man... just now. He had the __same look__. The same __wrongness__. But __stronger__. Like he knew exactly what he was and didn‚Äôt care who noticed. I felt it the second he looked at me."**

Her voice dropped, quieter now‚Äînearly a whisper.

**"He wasn‚Äôt just unsettling. He was dangerous. Being near him felt like standing at the edge of something hungry."**

Her voice lingered in the air like smoke, and for a moment, the silence in the van pressed in around her. Sophie glanced over, expecting... what, exactly? Reassurance? Agreement? Her own words were still echoing in her head, and suddenly they felt heavier than before.

**"God, listen to me,"** she muttered, dragging a hand down her face. **"I sound insane."** Her shoulders tensed, jaw clenched as she looked away again. The window gave her nothing back but the blur of cold dystopian city morning.

**"Maybe I‚Äôm reading into things too much. I‚Äôve been tired. Stretched thin. All the things we‚Äôve seen lately‚Ä¶ maybe I‚Äôm just wired for threats now, like I‚Äôm looking for monsters in every shadow... With you teaching me how to defend myself. Perhaps, its just reinforced because of that..."**


[3/24/2025 9:11 PM] Sophie Donovan
She let out a soft, breathy laugh‚Äîhumorless.

**"Paranoia dresses itself up real pretty when it wants to pass as intuition, huh?"**

But even as she said it, her arms folded tighter across her chest. That coil of unease hadn‚Äôt let up. Her eyes flicked to the rearview mirror, as if expecting to see the man‚Äôs reflection there, staring back.

**"Still‚Ä¶"** she said under her breath, barely audible. **"That feeling didn‚Äôt come from nowhere."**


[3/24/2025 10:16 PM] Kaedues Staub
*At first, Kaedues intends to listen to Sophie if only to discern whether or not it is actually a good idea to believe her hunch. As she continues, as she finds the words to describe how Kaedues acts to her.. there stirs to life an incessant buzzing noise in his head.*

*(A script..)*
-# *`(..have to build myself a narrative.)        (..not right. It can't be right, it doesn't fit the narrative.)`*

-# **`("They won't do that. Doesn't fit the narrative.")`**

-# *`(Think of possible actions and probable results. Think of the risks associated with playing into any one of these narratives.)`*
-# *`(The only way to get out of this without a hitch is for my answer to align completely with every piece of dialogue they heard.)`*


[3/24/2025 10:16 PM] Kaedues Staub
*Kaedues blinks. He checks his mirrors, and his blind spots, and finds a place to pull over to think. The choice to do this almost angers that buzzing feeling in his head, like an electric shock collar.*
**"Don't take it the wrong way. I don't want to think about this while I drive,"** *He explains.* **"So I'm going to pull over."**

*His chosen spot to pull over ticks all the boxes. It only takes a moment. While the car slows down, he feels himself pinching his index finger and thumb together. The pain, this time, recalls an earlier sensation.*

*`With the car parked, Kaedues leans forward a little. He closes his eyes and folds his forearms at his lap. That buzzing feeling.. He feels it. Somehow, it feels smaller than before.`*

-# *`(..This again. It happened outside Doug's apartment. When I..)`*
-# *`(...When James shoved me off to Gavyn.. It was like being pulled away from myself. To say I handled the situation naturally would be an understatement. I didn't 'do' any of that.)`*

*`(That feeling in the back of my head.. It appeared when she said that. It got worse when I thought about it.)`*
*`Kaedues' eyebrows gently push together..`*

*`(Come to think of it.. that's not the only time this has happened.)`*

## *`("..Exceptional.")`*
-# *`(Around that time was when I spaced out. The following dream.. I saw everything. I wasn't responding to her.)`*

-# *`(Not to mention the dream I had about the rooftop. It felt real.. it felt like it actually happened, like I was really there in the moment.)`*

## *`(My hand..)`*
-# *`(I don't remember where I got my hand. Actually.. I don't remember going to Monita at all. When Gavyn asked me about my trip.. I... remember thinking that I remembered. I couldn't picture the place then. It was like I was being told..)`*

## *`(And the code..)`*
-# *`(581677.. Grace told me in my dream. She didn't know about it when I asked her, even after we had touched base with a topic like that..)`*
-# *`("Even if it means forgetting about me..")`*

*`(If I think top-down.. and assume Sophie is right..)`*
*`Kaedues takes a deep breath in, and then out. Like he did outside Doug's apartment, he visualizes his actions up until this point. This time, from the very beginning. He finds the front end of this thread in his mind and begins to pull.`*

*`(After Danny was sent on his mission, he told me I wouldn't be chased after. That doesn't make any sense to me.. but still, the first thing I did was find someone to ask for work.)`*
*`(I also did that after returning from Monita.. and I never touched base with myself on what took place there..)`*
*`(Even now, up until very recently, delivering Sophie felt like a means to an end. That way, I could pursue my employment at Gavyn's warehouse.)`*


[3/24/2025 10:17 PM] Kaedues Staub·ûµ
*`(What Grace said..)`*
*`Kaedues' hands start to tremble.`* *`(I'm scared. I am afraid of getting gunned down by whatever infantry Grace described.. but somehow worse than that, I'm afraid of picking up a gun again.)`*

*`(It felt natural. That handgun felt like it belonged in my hands. I never felt that at the weapon shop.)`*

*`(The narratives.. Following the narrative I designed with these officers felt more than uplifting. It felt like reaching a quota after a long month of work.)`*
*`(Maybe.. That buzzing feeling.. it's... the opposite.)`*
*`(Maybe it means I am splitting away from a plan.)`*

*`As Kaedues continues to point out conspicuous and suspicious details alike to himself, he starts to realize that they are pointing somewhere. Grace's mild obsessions aren't unfounded.`*
*`(I haven't eaten in a day and a half and I'm not hungry. That's.. not normal. What's even stranger is that whenever I'm prompted to think about it, I don't. It's like I'm being strung along...)`*

*`Kaedues' eyes widen slowly. His lips gently part, and he grips both of his wrists with both of his hands.`*

**`"..I feel it too."`** *`His voice subtly trembles.`* **`"It's like I'm trapped in a box. I'm only capable of thinking about what I am allowed to think about.."`**

*`His tone sounds defeated. Pessimistic. His hand rises to clutch his temple.`*
**`"When I step out, so to speak.. I forget I ever did. I forgot I crashed that van. I forgot.. that I went to Monita, too."`**
*`He glances over at Sophie, but just looking at her prompts him to look in the opposite direction.`*
**`"Something's trimming the edges."`**


[3/24/2025 10:35 PM] Kaedues Staub·ûµ
**`"..My whole life, all I have done is work. But I don't want money. I don't.. I don't know why I do it in--"`**
*`His eyes start to dart across his vision, a sign that he is jumping from thought to thought.`*

**`"No.. you're right. I believe that."`**


[3/24/2025 10:47 PM] Sophie Donovan
As the van eased to a stop, Sophie glanced up sharply, her posture stiffening. Kaedues had barely said anything, but something in his voice, that careful phrasing‚Äî *"I don't want to think about this while I drive"*‚Äîmade her nerves twist at its ends... But, instead of tightening. It was like they were undoing themselves. The pain, the sudden lost of tension is what spooked her.  She was getting used to him in this regard.

She watched him out of the corner of her eye as he folded forward, closed off, like bracing for the impending doom.

Then, he began to speak.

At first, she was quiet‚Äîlistening. But not idly. Something had changed. His words didn't come defensively, didn't push back against her doubts. Instead, they cracked open, raw and unfiltered. Forgotten trauma that circled like a beast. His voice‚Äîso monotone before‚Äînow sounded like it was unraveling right in front of her.

And the moment he said *"Something's trimming the edges,"* she felt it. She opened her mouth, but no words came right away. When she finally spoke, her voice was low‚Äîalmost hollow. **" I thought I was just paranoid. I thought maybe I was losing it. That I was trying to see meaning in things just to feel safe‚Äîlike I could get ahead of whatever this is."**

Her gaze locked onto his trembling hands, then slowly traveled to his face‚Äîsearching for signs of anything familiar. Anything stable. **"You sound like you‚Äôre waking up from something."**

A silence bloomed between them again, heavy and breathless. Then she added, softly: **"We'll figure it out, I am confident we will."**

It was a quiet conviction, not flashy or loud, but something in her tone had shifted‚Äînoticeably. Sophie didn‚Äôt normally reach out or for that matter, smile; she never did. Not really. But her lips pressed together, her expression softening just enough to betray the effort it took to offer comfort. It wasn‚Äôt her nature to be reassuring‚Äîbut something about seeing him unravel had drawn it out of her.

*`Kaedues looks over to her again, rather, in her general direction. His eyes flick down, and then away. What she said, 'waking up from something'.. It strikes somewhere currently invisible.`*

*`He takes a breath in deep. Deeper than he usually does, to taste the air and let it fill his lungs completely. He breathes out, and looks in Sophie's direction again.`*
**`"I lied earlier. When you asked about my parents.. well, I didn't.. think I was lying,"`** *`he explains carefully. There is a hesitation in his voice-- not like he is picking what to say; Like he hasn't found the words yet.`*
**`"I don't remember them. I.. I don't remember.. anything past a couple years ago."`**


[3/24/2025 11:08 PM] Sophie Donovan
Sophie didn‚Äôt move. Not right away. Her eyes stayed on him as he spoke, tracking every small shift in his voice, his breath, his posture.

When he said *"I don‚Äôt remember anything past a couple years ago,"* she felt her throat tighten‚Äînot out of fear for herself, but for him. For the version of him that was somewhere behind that fog, if he ever existed at all.

A few seconds passed.

Then‚Äî**"Okay."**

It wasn‚Äôt dismissive. It was agreement. A recognition. 

Exhaling, Sophie looked towards their front. Just gazing out there. Emotion swirled inside her being. 

**"That‚Äôs where we start then."** She looked back at him‚Äîeyes narrowed slightly, not in suspicion, but in focus. Resolved. **"Let's help each other. You help me get back to my family... And we help you find yourself. I think that is fair."**

*`Kaedues looks out the windshield as well. He nods in acknowledgement of her statement.`*
**`"..You aren't worried?"`** *`He asks. His fingers grasp the keys in the ignition but do not turn them.`*


[3/24/2025 11:26 PM] Sophie Donovan
**"Of course I'm scared..."** The words came without hestitation, but her tone remained leveled‚Äîcontrolled. **"But after seeing you, watching what you've done so far and what you taught me... I don't think fear gets to make decisions anymore."** She closes her eyes slowly, before reopening them and resting her head against the door.

*`Hearing that, Kaedues finds that he is growing more comfortable with this strange lucidity he feels. After talking about it like this..`*


[3/24/2025 11:32 PM] Kaedues Staub·ûµ
*..It does not feel as foreign. Where he expects a snap-back, a cleansing of his short-term memory, there is none. His situation has become much more complicated now, and yet.. in some way, a little simpler.*

*He turns the keys in the ignition, and checks his mirrors and blindspots before pulling forward.*

The door chimed once as it swung open, then again as it shut behind them. He didn't move, not right away. His eyes downcast at the ingredients he was preparing for the next customer that may appear through the door. From his perihperial vision, the van rolled out of the lot and coasted down the road, its taillights blinking lazily at the empy morning stretch.

## [His jaw ticked](https://youtu.be/gZVB8Y9zSI4?si=xKksPEOzI0FLPR4S&t=15) ##

The kiosk beeped softly as it entered standby, but he didn't hear it. Not really. His hand moved slowly towards the pocket beneath the counter, fingers curling inwards. He pulled out the crumpled pack of gum‚Äîcoconut flavor, his preferred tick‚Äîand fumbled with the foil flap.

Below the prep table and beneath the lip of the counter, piles of twisted gum wrappers had gathered like litter in forgotten corners of Haven Heights. Some old, some fresh. All hidden from a customer's view but very much part of the ritual. A private archive of nerves...

The tremor hit as he tried to peel one piece free. Not subtle. His hands shook like they'd forgotten what calm felt like. But his face‚Äîhis face didn't move. No twitch in the brow. No shift in the jawline aside from that one time. Just the same detached chill he wore when taking orders, the same mask that said he was no one.

But sophie had looked at him. Not through him. **At him.** 

And not like a customer. Like something else. Like she was weighing something in her mind and finding the math didn't add up.

He slid the gum between his teeth and chewed slow. Deliberate. The flavor hit sharp and sweet, a distraction that never worked but always helped him pretend it might.

## She saw something. ##

He could feel it. The way her stare clung for just one beat too long. The way her body turned first,  but her eyes hesistated. People like that were dangerous. Wary people don't walk away‚Äîthey circle back. 

He glanced down the road again, even though the van was already gone. Though, he was able t

o burn the license plate into his mind. He reached beneath the counter, pulling out a slip of wrapping paper for the gyros and took a pen in which he used to write down digital orders. Nothing was written on it yet.

But it will be.

-# soon.
