*On the wide desk, his primary firearms are laid out in a precise and orderly manner...*


[5/28/2023 4:44 PM] Ghostgaze
*Ghostgaze's eyes are drawn to the advanced model of the MP5K, known as the __Spectre SM5,__ resting on the wide desk. Its sleek and modern design immediately catches his attention, hinting at its cutting-edge firearm technology.

[5/29/2023 10:07 PM] Narration
Ghostgaze reached his home at midnight. Having to navigate around the CCR in Littleton increases travel time. Upon arrival, his base was untouched, undisturbed by Vespera's outside noise. The rain has been pouring non-stop since they escaped from the CCR.


[5/29/2023 10:13 PM] Ghostgaze
*Ghostgaze entered his home, shutting the door behind him to shut out the relentless rain and the chaos of the city. The interior was dimly lit. The sound of rain pattering against the windows provided a soothing backdrop to the otherwise quiet space.*

*He took a moment to remove his gear, setting his weapons and equipment in their designated places. His cloak, still damp from the rain-soaked streets, was hung up to dry. Ghostgaze moved with purpose, his movements precise and efficient.*


[5/29/2023 10:51 PM] Ghostgaze
**. . .**

*Ghostgaze sat on his chair, his boots now removed, revealing a minor injury on his foot. He inspected the wound, noting that it was __healing well.__ The pain had subsided, allowing him to move more freely. He cleaned the wound and applied a small bandage, a routine gesture to ensure his physical well-being.*

*As he tended to his injury, Ghostgaze's thoughts __drifted towards his recent encounters with Paige Underwood.__ It was a departure from his usual solitary existence, a deviation from the __detached__ and __self-serving nature__ that had defined him for so long. He found himself reflecting on the moments they shared, the unexpected __camaraderie__ that developed amidst the chaos.*

*For a lone wolf like Ghostgaze, opening up and extending a helping hand to someone in need was a __rarity.__ He had always relied on himself, trusting __no one__ but his own instincts and skills. But something about Paige, her resilience and determination, had resonated with him. In the face of danger and uncertainty, he had found himself willing to protect her, to lend a hand in their __shared struggle__ for survival.*

*It was an __unfamiliar sensation,__ this connection forged in the crucible of adversity. Ghostgaze contemplated the implications of these newfound emotions, the potential impact they could have on his future. The boundaries of his solitary existence had been blurred, and he was left to navigate uncharted territory.*

*As he sat in his chair, the rain outside gradually subsiding, Ghostgaze acknowledged the transformative nature of his encounters with Paige. He knew that he couldn't ignore the lasting impression she had left on him. While he remained guarded and cautious, his experiences had shown him that even the most steadfast lone wolves could find __solace__ in the presence of others.*


[5/29/2023 11:03 PM] Ghostgaze
*As Ghostgaze sat in his chair, his mind delved deep into introspection. The events of recent days had forced him to reevaluate his position and consider the implications of his next moves. The rain outside provided a rhythmic backdrop to his thoughts, heightening the weight of the decisions that lay before him.*

**"I need to consider my next moves wisely,"** *he murmured to himself, the words hanging in the air. The realization settled upon him that everything had changed, that he now stood in the crosshairs of the CCR. The encounters with the lawmen had made it clear that his survival was no longer a matter of chance, but of __calculated strategy.__*

*A solitary fighter against the might of the CCR was a daunting prospect, one that offered little hope of victory. Ghostgaze understood the odds stacked against him, the overwhelming force that would inevitably come knocking at his door. His chances of emerging triumphant in such a battle were slim, __at best.__*

*His thoughts turned to a different path, one that held the promise of collaboration and collective strength. There existed a __renowned group,__ known for their opposition to the government and their unwavering dedication to liberation. Joining their ranks would provide Ghostgaze with a network of like-minded individuals, allies who shared his values and stood against the oppressive regime.*

**"I have better chances to work with them,"** *he mused, his mind traversing the possibilities. The image of a well-organized collective, united in purpose, began to take shape in his thoughts. With their resources, knowledge, and shared mission, Ghostgaze knew that his chances of survival would increase exponentially. He recognized the value of aligning himself with a force already recognized for their resistance against the CCR.*

**. . .**


[5/29/2023 11:03 PM] Ghostgaze
*However, the decision weighed heavily on him. Ghostgaze was no stranger to solitude, having forged his path as a __lone wolf__ for years. The prospect of entrusting his fate to others was a departure from his accustomed way of life. Yet, the circumstances demanded adaptability and the wisdom to recognize when strength lay in unity.*

*Deep within his thoughts, Ghost resolved to prioritize his __survival above all else.__ The time for reckoning with the CCR loomed near, and he knew he could not face them alone. The choice to seek the well-renowned group, to embrace their liberation ideologies, offered a glimmer of hope amidst the encroaching darkness.*


[5/29/2023 11:14 PM] Ghostgaze
*Rising from his chair, Ghostgaze made his way to the armory room of his home. The room was dimly lit, with various weapons, ammunition, and gear neatly organized on shelves and racks. He ran his fingers along the cold steel of his arsenal, his touch familiar with each item's weight and purpose.*

*After a moment of reflection, Ghostgaze turned his attention to his wardrobe. Opening the doors, he revealed an array of clothing options. However, his gaze settled on his original outfit, the one he had worn before the recent events unfolded. It was a combination of practicality and style, designed to provide both mobility and a sense of his unique identity.*

*With purposeful movements, Ghostgaze changed into his familiar attire…*

*Next, he retrieved __three single-stack magazines,__ each one loaded with ammunition specially chosen for its effectiveness and stopping power. He smoothly inserted the magazines into their designated slots on his utility belt, ensuring he had an ample supply of rounds at his disposal.*

*Finally, Ghostgaze made sure to secure his __Ka-Bar knife,__ a versatile and durable blade that had saved him in numerous close-quarter encounters. He sheathed the knife and positioned it in a strategic location on his belt, easily within reach when the situation demanded it.*

*With his Midnight Edge handgun holstered at his side and his trusty Ka-Bar knife by his side, Ghostgaze felt a renewed sense of readiness. His weapons were extensions of himself, tools that had seen him through countless battles. They represented his skills, his resourcefulness, and his commitment to __survival.__*


[5/29/2023 11:22 PM] Ghostgaze
*Ghostgaze made his way to his personal space, a small area in his home where he had set up his mattress. It was a humble and modest setup, but it provided him with the rest he needed after long days and nights on the move.*

*With his senses heightened and his guard up, Ghostgaze settled onto the mattress. He positioned himself in a way that allowed him to have a clear view of the entrance to his hideout. Every sound, every movement outside would be detected by his keen senses.*

*As he lay there, his mind remained alert, running through different scenarios and contingencies. He knew it was only a matter of time until the CCR operatives tracked him down. They were relentless and resourceful, stopping at nothing to apprehend or eliminate their targets.*


[5/31/2023 8:38 PM] Narration
The night went without further incident. Orange tinted light filtered into the room.


[5/31/2023 8:44 PM] Ghostgaze
*As the orange-tinted light gradually filled the room, Ghost rose from his mattress with a neutral expression. He had spent a __restless night__, ever-vigilant and ready for any potential threat. The absence of any immediate danger allowed him a brief moment of respite.*

*Keeping his guard up, Ghostgaze made his way to his armoury. He took a seat on a sturdy chair, surrounded by an array of weapons and equipment. It was a place of __familiarity__ and __preparation,__ a space where he could gather his thoughts and plan his next move.*

*Leaning forward, he rested his elbows on the table, intertwining his fingers as he __contemplated__ the path ahead. The events of the past days had thrust him into unfamiliar territory, pushing him to question his previous __way of life__ and the choices that had led him here.*


[5/31/2023 8:48 PM] Ghostgaze
**. . .**

*The orange light cast subtle shadows across the room, accentuating the weight of the situation. Ghostgaze's thoughts delved __deep__ into the depths of his experiences and the lessons he had learned along the way. He had always been a __solitary figure,__ relying on his own skills and cunning to navigate the dangerous world he inhabited.*

*But now, circumstances had changed. He had crossed paths with individuals who offered him __a chance__ at a different kind of existence, a chance to join forces with individuals who opposed the CCR. It was an opportunity he hadn't anticipated, one that forced him to reconsider his path.*

*As he sat there, contemplating his next move, Ghostgaze felt a mix of __uncertainty__ and __determination.__ He knew he had to make a choice, to weigh the __risks__ and __benefits__ of aligning himself with a group like __Horizon Grey.__ It was a decision that would shape his future, impacting not only his own __survival__ but also the lives of those he would come to __rely on.__*


[5/31/2023 8:57 PM] Ghostgaze
*Slowly, he raised a bandaged finger towards the right side of his mask, his cyberdeck. With a subtle touch, he activated the communication interface, __initiating a phone call.__*

*His finger hovered momentarily over the designated contact on his cyberdeck's interface. The __number__ he had been given earlier glowed on the screen, a connection to __a potential ally__ in the chaotic world he now found himself in. It was a leap of faith, reaching out to someone he had just met, __but desperate times called for desperate measures.__*

*With a sense of __hesitation,__ Ghostgaze pressed the screen, __initiating the call.__ The connection hummed to life, and he listened attentively as the line rang on the other end, __waiting for a response.__*


[5/31/2023 9:07 PM] Paige
> **"I wonder who called?"** Sarcasm resonating within his head.


[5/31/2023 9:16 PM] Ghostgaze
*Ghost's stoic expression remained unchanged as he heard Paige's sarcastic remark. Ignoring the comment, he focused on the call at hand. In his rough and deep voice, he uttered the words,* **"Where should we meet up?"**

*With those few words, Ghost conveyed his interest in __joining forces,__ his willingness to delve deeper and align himself with those who opposed the forces of the CCR. His tone was resolute and determined, leaving no room for __doubt__ or __hesitation__ now.*

[5/31/2023 9:31 PM] Ghostgaze
*Ghostgaze processed the location and timeframe mentioned by the voice on the other end of the call. He nodded imperceptibly, acknowledging the task ahead.* **"Two hours. I'll be there,"** *he replied in his unwavering voice, devoid of any unnecessary words.*

*With his commitment confirmed, Ghostgaze __disconnected the call__ and slipped his finger away from his mask. The wheels of action were set in motion, and he knew he had little time to spare. Rising from the chair in his armory, he retrieved his gear, ensuring he was fully prepared for the upcoming meeting.*

*Without further delay, __Ghostgaze left his hideout.__*

[12/24/2024 11:41 PM] Narration
It took the duo an hour to reach their destination. From getting through the Fairview - Kapea checkpoint to racing the rest of the way to the designated meeting point. The occasional storm rolled in. Rain bombarded the Enforcer as they pulled into an empty lot with several CCR enforcers and a Knight APC already waiting. The Haven Heights forces certainly did not have all the gear that Fairview members had. If anything, it was quite underwhelming with the gear they worked with. Most Haven Heights forces were equipped with outdated weapons and armor that seemed more suited to training exercises than real combat.


[12/24/2024 11:44 PM] Narration
Rob, Mason's partner had his rifle slung across his chest and a hand on the handle just above his door. His eyes focused on their flanks as they stopped a few meters from the APC. The air was thick with tension, a palpable unease settling over the lot as the rain drummed insistently on the vehicles. The low murmur of conversations mingled with the distant rumble of thunder, creating an ominous soundtrack to their arrival. Despite the presence of allies, the sense of vulnerability was undeniable, with everyone acutely aware of the stark contrast between the impressive equipment of the CCR enforcers and their own meager arsenal.


[12/24/2024 11:44 PM] Rob Upton
**"Shit man, I hate Haven Heights with a burning passion..."** He murmured as he rested his free hand on top of the optic mounted on top of his rifle.


[12/25/2024 12:24 AM] Mason Reed
"Yeah, not really an eye pleasing place compared to the rest of District 9." *Mason made sure to drive carefully, not just because of the rain, but also because of the place that they were in. Compared to the rest of police here, they were basically a giant spotlight sure to attract unwanted stares. Once they arrived at their location his eyes glanced to every so person that was nearby. The feeling that they'd left their own personal safe zone now in effect.*

"Let's just get in and out. If all goes well this shouldn't take to long, hopefully."


[12/25/2024 12:34 AM] Rob Upton
He gave a curt nod to Mason before pushing open his door. The relentless patter of rain drowned out all other sounds, save for the distant, sporadic gunfire echoing from warring factions deep within 'The Stacks'.


[12/25/2024 12:34 AM] Narration
The duo approached the ragtag group of CCR lawmen who were waiting for them, their curious glances following the pair as Lt. John stood silently, his gaze fixed and unreadable.


[12/25/2024 12:34 AM] Lt. John
**"You're late,"** the Lieutenant growled, his voice dripping with disdain. **"Team Foxtrot has been at the target location for forty minutes. Any longer and I'd have the two of you charged with desertion."**


[12/25/2024 12:36 AM] Rob Upton
Rob approached and immediately went to attention. Not wanting to make matters more difficult, he remained silent and stood at attention.


[12/25/2024 12:36 AM] Lt. John
The Lieutenant stared at him for a few seconds and then looked towards Mason who was nearby.


[12/25/2024 12:58 AM] Mason Reed
"Apologies, sir." *Once Mason walked up closer he stood to attention.* "We’d just returned to the station from our previous assignment to be briefed on the current situation, sir."


[12/25/2024 1:13 AM] Lt. John
**"I didn't __ASK__."** He emphasized the last word in his sentence. Shaking his head in disappointment. He finally addressed the entire team. **"Now that we are all here, the task is simple. We get in, identify if this Cole Mercer asshole is currently holed up in this dump and neutralize him. We have a significant amount of resources elsewhere so we must make do with what we got. Splitting into teams of two will give us enough ground to cover all the entrances and exits while being able to sweep and clear the facility."** He would point out two lawmen. **"You two will hold rear security on the North-side of the building. And you two will be entering from the North. You two the East and you both on the entry team. West will be you two and..."** He turned his attention back towards Mason and Rob. **"You two lazy fucks will be the entry team on the South side."**


[12/25/2024 2:02 AM] Mason Reed
*Of course they get singled out. They're the only ones with proper relevance.* "Mmrg..." *A hushed grumble was made by Mason, a slight eyeroll was even there if you looked hard enough.*

`"This guy needs an ego check..."`


[12/25/2024 2:09 AM] Lt. John
**"Alright ladies, lets get this show on the road. I want every inch of this place combed."**He'd announce to everyone, signalling with his hand to get moving.


[12/25/2024 2:10 AM] Rob Upton
Rob turned towards Mason before nudging his head into the direction of the facility they were meant to go to.


[12/25/2024 2:33 AM] Mason Reed
*Mason nodded and started moving toward the South side of the building. He made sure his equipment was in working condition while walking, trying to take his mind off of John.*


[12/25/2024 5:38 PM] Narration
The teams dispersed throughout the night. The sounds of gear and boots crunching against the pavement drown background ambient. The streets were empty except for the occasional stray cat or raccoon. The moonlight shone down, creating an eerie glow that illuminated the deserted streets. The neon signs that adorn the rows of buildings have ceased to function. Mason, Rob, and their flanking team moved methodically through an alley on the south side of the building. One light above the door beckoned the team, like a beacon. As they approached, the alley was cluttered with overflowing trash cans and scattered debris, making each step precarious. Puddles from a recent rainstorm reflected dim light, creating slippery patches that required careful navigation. The distant hum of a generator added an unsettling backdrop.

Just ahead of the team was a low-wall comprised of a few wooden pallets. The pallets were rickety, and seemed to sway slightly in the wind, adding to the eerie atmosphere. There was very little room move around them. Mason was point-man, so he had a choice. Vaulting or break his way through. What will he do?

[12/25/2024 9:33 PM] Mason Reed
*Mason made his way carefully through the South side of the base, taking notice of anything that could seem out of place or in place..? This was the first time in this specific base, so whatever he did and where ever he went he had to be cautious. Once he reached the rickety wooden pallets, a decision dawned on him.*

*Either break down the pallets, or vault over them. Considering the situation, breaking them might trigger...something, and that wasn't a risk he wanted to take. Vaulting over it seemed the most safest, as the pallets might have a trap. But, **that's how losers think!** They were just pallets, so...* "**Hmph!**" *Mason raised his right leg, and with a sharp lunge--he kicked the pallets away instead of blasting through them.*


[12/25/2024 9:38 PM] Narration
Mason's kick shattered the pallets, sending splintered wet wood scattering across the concrete pathway. A single sealed barrel tipped over and rolled in a circular motion towards the right wall of the alley, its movement masked by the sound of thunder.

Now, the only obstacle between Mason and his team was the journey to the door and getting inside the factory.


[12/25/2024 9:38 PM] Rob Upton
Rob moved past Mason and cautiously made his way on one side of the doorframe. His rifle's muzzle raised in a high-ready position as he awaited either __Mason__ **or** __one of the other lawmen__ to take position on the opposite side of the frame.


[12/25/2024 9:38 PM] Narration
Will Mason pull security at this moment, or will he post up with Rob on the door frame?


[12/25/2024 9:44 PM] Mason Reed
*Without any hesitation he nodded toward Rob, signaling he chose him. Compared to the rest of the security, Rob was the most obvious choice to Mason, as he was the person he trusted the most and had the most confidence in. Once he nodded, he moved over the the side of the door frame, readying his rifle.*


[12/25/2024 9:57 PM] Rob Upton
Rob nodded once, before reaching for the door handle. He hesitated for a moment, wondering if he was truly ready for what lay beyond the door. Doubts lingered in his mind, but he knew he had to face whatever awaited him. Taking a deep breath, he steeled himself for the challenge ahead. He grasped the door handle and twisted it. Then another... It was locked. **"Locked."** He whispered, **"Hold on, I think I got a lock forcer."** He searched his belt.


[12/25/2024 9:57 PM] Narration
One of the other lawmen, impatient and reckless, couldn't wait any longer. Lt. John would have their heads if they didn't move quickly. He stepped forward, growling at Rob, **"Move, kid, we don't have all day to be messing around with fancy toys."** He positioned himself and kicked just inside the lock on the door. The door burst open, and the moment the lawman's foot hit the ground, a deafening blast shattered their world.

The lawman's chest erupted in a spray of blood and gore, his body practically splitting apart as chunks of flesh and bone splattered across the opposite wall of the alley. The sheer force of the explosion tore him to pieces, leaving a gruesome, bloody mess in its wake.

**"FUCK!"** Rob shout as this sudden turn of events shook him to his core. That guy was literally wiped off the face of this planet in mere seconds. Rob stumbled back, his mind racing as adrenaline surged through his veins. He quickly scanned the area, searching for any sign of movement or further threats. Forget the door for the time being!

[12/25/2024 10:10 PM] Mason Reed
*Masons heart stopped as the deafening shot went off right infront of him. He didn't even close his eyes, the view of the officers body parts being blown back on to the wall was seen clear as day.*

"**Shit!**" *Mason's body tensed up, slightly moving back from the doors frame.* "**What was that idiot thinking?!**"


[12/25/2024 10:11 PM] Rob Upton
**"I don't know!"** He'd exclaim under his breath. His gaze returning towards the door. **"Mother fucker... has this entire place rigged, I'm telling you."**


[12/25/2024 10:23 PM] Mason Reed
*He'd take a deep breath.* "Of course he does... Who would leave their __Haven Heights hidden base__ trap free?" *Mason slightly shook his head as he recomposed himself. Other than the idiot who got himself killed, there was one more officer with them. In a dark sense, they had **one** more free mistake. Of course, Mason would prefer everyone make it out alive.*

"Let's..." *His mind blanked for a second.* "...Shit, let's just stay careful. Assume every door, corner--any opening has a trap that could spring at us. I don't want anymore mangled corpses." *Mason gave Rob a look that hinted that what he said was mostly for him.*


[12/25/2024 10:26 PM] Rob Upton
**"Right."** He'd eye the door frame from his angle... Someone was going to have to peek it and it wasn't going to be him.


[12/25/2024 10:32 PM] Mason Reed
*...Understandable.* "Yeah, yeah..." *Mason peeked closer to the doors frame, slightly inching his eye through the door.*


[12/25/2024 10:33 PM] Narration
What he was able to see was a kinetic shotgun hanging by some steel cables. Pointing at the door with its muzzle still smoking from 8 gauge shell.


[12/25/2024 10:50 PM] Mason Reed
*That would explain why the guy got sent back so far. If it was a mine, then everyone here would be on the ground.* "Looks like he already took the punishment for us, so this room should be 'safe' to check out. Unless you want to move on?" *He turned to Rob, waiting for his decision.*


[12/25/2024 10:52 PM] Rob Upton
**"If we don't check every inch then we'll just leave ourselves open to more surprises."** He'd remark, steading his breathing.


[12/25/2024 10:52 PM] Rob Upton
**"Let's hard clear it."**


[12/25/2024 11:48 PM] Mason Reed
"Gotcha." *Mason was the first one to go into the room, making sure to keep clear of the shotgun. Once he was in, his eyes scanned the room, before he decided to snoop around he atleast wanted to make sure that nothing else would blow him to bits.*


[12/26/2024 12:01 AM] Narration
Mason swept into the room which was a pretty sizable hallway. Rooms lined the hall. Each of the doors had an opening that ran down the length of it. At first glance, it appears that this section of the building was the utilitized. Such as power, boiler room, and water. At the end of the hallway was a closed door, leading somewhere into the rest of the building. There was broken glass, pipes littered everywhere and rust dominated the scene... Watch your step.


[12/26/2024 12:01 AM] Rob Upton
Rob entered after Mason, shining his flashlight so he could peer into the more darkened areas they might come across.


[12/26/2024 6:35 PM] Mason Reed
*As they moved through the rooms, he kept an eye out for the dark corners and made sure not to step on anything to loud like the glass and pipes. At first he was more cautious to move around, but surely the person who owned this place didn't have traps just laying on the floor, right? All he could really do was trust his senses.*

*He peeked his head through each room as he passed them by, taking small mental notes of the things in the rooms. His main goal was to reach the closed door and the end of the hall.*


[12/26/2024 8:58 PM] Narration
Behind the door at the end of the hall, a piercing cry rang out. It was almost as if their hands had been chopped off and left to die on the concrete floor. Soon after, the warehouse was rocked by an explosion. As if on cue, the lights above them flickered and swayed. In other words, it was a kill house. As Mason pushed towards the door, his sectors were clear. The air was thick with smoke and the acrid smell of burning debris. Shattered glass and debris littered the floor. It would appear that the vacation time they were promised was miles away...

 The door at the end of the hallway was a heavy steel barrier, battered and scarred from years of use. Its once smooth surface was now marred with deep scratches and dents, evidence of countless attempts to breach it.


[12/26/2024 9:47 PM] Mason Reed
*The screams and explosions didn't make this any easier to bear than before. If anything it felt like they where walking closer to the jaws of death. Once they got to the giant steel door he lowered his gun and took a moment to analyze it. It was heavily beaten up, to the point where it looked like it wouldn't take TOO much effort to bash down. The real scare though..was whatever was on the opposite side of this door.*

*As if to test the waters, Mason brought his left hand to the door and knocked on it a few times. Did it sound hollow?*


[12/26/2024 10:05 PM] Narration
It was a solid door. Bashing it down would be nigh impossible with his current build.

*Busting it down with pure force didn't seem like an option, and trying to go around it seemed like it'd take a while.* "..." *He contemplated his options* "Any idea's, Rob?"


[1/1/2025 10:19 PM] Rob Upton
Rob approached Mason from his left with his back towards his partner. There was no way in hell, he was going to allow their backs to be exposed without properly investigating every inch and crevice that this facility had to offer. A methodical sweep left and right was all that was left before he turned around to evaluate what Mason was referring to. Ah, the door is what Mason was talking about. He too thought about forcing it at first glance. Although, upon thinking on it prompted him to scratch the idea all together. 

The door was an automated door that was locked. That right there was a lead. Rob observed the door's state and had an idea. **"I got an idea how we can get this opened."** Rob replied, his eyes went from the door towards the door frame. Then, the corners of the ceiling and what rooms could be adjacent to this one. **"Automated doors like these tend to open upon power failure; Security protocol. __You__ can ask if Dylan could she could cut the power."** He really wanted to avoid interacting with Dylan at all costs, even if it was a intense situation like this one. Sheesh.


[1/1/2025 11:28 PM] Mason Reed
"..." *Really, Rob?* "Yeah, got it.." *Pushing Rob's shyness to the back of his mind, Mason made the call to Dylan using his cybernetics. While doing so, he checked the door a second time to see if there was any small detail he missed. If not, then he'd just have to rely on Dylan to get them through if she could.*


[1/1/2025 11:32 PM] Dylan Hackett
`"Mason, you're ok!"` She exclaimed. `"I've been monitoring the situation and at least 5 lawmen flatlined in the last two minutes... Did you end up getting Mercer?"`


[1/1/2025 11:32 PM] Narration
The door was solid with really no other way to open it. Like a blast door against explosions... What kind of facility was this?


[1/1/2025 11:59 PM] Mason Reed
*Dylan's sudden exclamation surprised Mason. To some extent it did lighten his mood, however.* "Nope, no luck on Mercer... We did come in contact with some of his traps though. One of our officers got blasted by a suspended shotgun. High chance the other 4 got hit with his toys aswell."

"Aside from that, we found a giant blast-like door the leads to another side of the building. Can't knock it down with brute force, so I called you to see if you could cut the power, maybe that'll open it up."


[1/2/2025 12:11 AM] Dylan Hackett
`"Uhhh.. Ok.. Need to vector in on the power grid... Power, power, power... Alright... I could cut power the the entire facility. Or just the door. The door will take me more time because I'll have to inspect power fluxes. If I do the entire facility, everyone is going to get plunged into the darkness. If you want just the door, I'll need some kind of identifier of that door. A label or something."`


[1/2/2025 12:11 AM] Narration
Mason needed to make a choice quickly. Will he have Dylan __cut power to the entire facility__, or spend the extra time to __cut the power to the door__ specifically. Judging by the amount of information needed for the door itself, it certainly would take Dylan potentially **precious** time to do it.


[1/2/2025 12:42 AM] Mason Reed
"..." *Good question. Should he cut the power to the whole building, or just the door? Judging how little he knows about this place keeping the lights on would be beneficial physically and mentally. He's not even sure if all the traps are electronic or handmade like the shotgun. If majority fall into the latter then keeping the power on would be better.*

*There's also considering the amount of people still alive, where are they right now?* "Mmmrg..." *Mason closed hsi eyes and scrunched his forehead with two of his fingers.* "Dylan, how long will it take you to turn off only the door, and can you locate the rest of our members?"


[1/2/2025 12:47 AM] Dylan Hackett
`"Uh.. 30 seconds maybe? A minute... two? I'll have to physically locate it. The access control in that place is ancient... I have the location of everyone that is still alive... But its just approximation from the interface I am allowed to reference."`


[1/2/2025 12:47 AM] Narration
Another explosion rocked the building...


[1/2/2025 12:48 AM] Dylan Hackett
`"...Mason. Be. Careful."`

[1/3/2025 5:44 PM] Mason Reed
"**Fuck..!**" *Mason took a quick deep breath.* `("Is this Mercer guy even in the building?! And what's causing those explosions to go off??")` *He shook his head and turned his attention back to the call.*

"Cut off the building's electricity. We can't waste any more time waiting around, even though it will be a significant risk. In any case, we have our own flashlights. Our view may be limited, but it's not something we haven't been through before."


[1/3/2025 5:56 PM] Narration
The power was cut the moment he made his decision. The pair was plunged into darkness. The sound of the generators keeping the place alive began deaccelerating internally. Making a descending whirling noise all the more prominent.


[1/3/2025 5:56 PM] Dylan Hackett
`"Done."`


[1/3/2025 5:56 PM] Narration
The door slid open, just the sound of distant footsteps and command shouts could be heard echoing in the endless void expanse. Distant sirens could be heard approaching the factory; Reinforcements were on their way.


[1/3/2025 5:56 PM] Dylan Hackett
`"I— Something is developing at the second location. Got to go."` With that, Dylan hung up. Must've been important.


[1/3/2025 8:39 PM] Mason Reed
"Huh..." *A concerning expression appeared on Masons face as she hung up. But, for now, he had more pressing matters to focus on. With the door now open, Mason turned on his flashlight and aimed it down at the ground near the door, making sure there wasn't any mines or trip wires.*


[1/3/2025 8:45 PM] Narration
Mason's flashlight plunged into the darkness. Lightning struck in unison with the torch being lit. Revealing a sizeable generator room; This is where the whirling noise was originating from. He could see the dance of other flashlights further within the generator room, indicating that there were more lawmen within the area. Commands were being barked back and fourth between them.

-# beep. beep.


[1/3/2025 8:45 PM] Rob Upton
His flashlight came on and his light was positioned on their flanks. Rob kept one hand on Mason's shoulder as a bid to not lose him within the dark.

"Moving in..." *He took careful steps inside the room, making sure to keep a steady pace so Rob could keep track of him. His flashlight scanned around the room to get a better look of its interior. It was good that he could see the rest of the teams light so he'd be able to know their general location.*

"There’s still no sign that the suspects were inside the building recently—at least, not from our perspective."


[1/3/2025 9:15 PM] Rob Upton
**"I swear, if someone jumps from one of those generators..."** He muttered. His eyes dancing around as he twisted his body this way and that. **"I'd imagine we would've found someone by now."**


[1/3/2025 9:15 PM] Narration
The traps stopped triggering from the lack of explosions and screaming. All that was left was the whimpering and gurgling of those fallen. The occassional lawmen telling his partner to calm down or others continuing the search. On the catwalk, Mason could see a team of two slowly traversing the walkway, their lights searching down below to see if they could find their target.

-# beep. beep.


[1/3/2025 9:41 PM] Mason Reed
*Rob was right, with this many people in a building like this, it'd be weird to not find **anything.** Or at least hear some lead an officer found on coms. At that moment a twirling knot formed in Mason's stomach. He doubted anyone was in here besides officers, so what was their reason in being here? Something was starting to bug at Mason.*

"...Rob, do you hear that?"


[1/3/2025 9:54 PM] Rob Upton
**"Hear what?"** He'd turn towards Mason, listening out for anything that stood out, but heard nothing.

-# beep. beep.


[1/3/2025 9:56 PM] gardengnostic2
sorry for being right


[1/3/2025 10:21 PM] Mason Reed
"Not really sure myself..I hope it's not what I think it is..." *After saying that Mason went silent. He took a few steps forward to the direction he thinks the noise is coming from. With each step a feeling to retreat began to rise up within him.*


[1/3/2025 10:23 PM] Narration
-# beep. beep. beep
beep. beep. beep.

The direction Mason was going was the correct one as the beeping gotten louder.


[1/3/2025 10:23 PM] Rob Upton
**"I hear it... shit."**


[1/3/2025 10:36 PM] Mason Reed
"Ah hell..." *His walk speed increased as the beeping got louder. The tension in Mason's body was starting to become apparent the longer they stayed in this room. He was questioning to himself why he was still walking toward the source, any sane person would immideitally high tail it out of here. But, for some reason he didn't. Almost like he had something to prove.*

*If this situation really was what he was thinking, then they were probably just set up for failure.*


[1/3/2025 10:40 PM] Narration
Mason turned the corner and he was presented with a timed bomb connected two objects. A cable that was draped across the ground to a generator which was now **off**. A deadman's switch. If the power goes out then the timer starts. The bomb itself was connected to a pressure-tank that had been building pressure while the power was on. The gauge reading that the tank was practically bursting with just enough exhaust to bleed off the amount of pressure that would send the place into the next dimension. **56 seconds** were remaining on the timer.

**Beep!!! Beep!!! Beep!!!**


[1/3/2025 10:40 PM] Rob Upton
**"Shit man, it's a fucking bomb. We got to get out of here, now!"** He'd exclaim.


[1/3/2025 10:56 PM] Mason Reed
"**I fucking knew it!**" *All because he decided to turn off the power...He could run out, but what of the other officers. Once this goes off everyone here would most definitely flatline, and he would be the main cause of it. so...*

"**Man, FUCK!!**" *Mason got closer to the bomb, inspecting every inch of it as fast as he could. Though, he wasn't a bomb expert. He had no idea what specific model of bomb this was, or practically anything about it, disarming it with the bits of knowledge he has about bomb disarming. Yeah, the chances aren't very high.*


[1/3/2025 11:00 PM] Rob Upton
**"Come on, Mason, leave it!"** He'd exclaim, pulling on Mason's shoulder. **"There is nothing worth salvaging in this place! He ain't here!! If we go now then we can make it out!"**


[1/3/2025 11:00 PM] Narration
The bomb had three tubes going from the top to the side of the device. Blue, Red, and Green. No analog buttons on the exterior.


[1/3/2025 11:19 PM] Mason Reed
*Once Rob tugged at his shoulders, it seemed to have snapped Mason out of his trance.* "...**Dammit..!!**" *He then turned around and bolted out of the room, making sure Rob and the other officer was still behind him. A part of him wanted to try and disarm the bomb, but that was a risk he wouldn't forgive himself for if he failed.*

*While running, though, he sent out a message on coms that there was a bomb in the main generator room, to at least warn the other officers within the building to get out.*


[1/3/2025 11:27 PM] Narration
The moment his radio message was sent. He could hear the other lawmen in the building begin to scramble. This was a good thing for that this building was about to go up sky-high! Mason and Rob managed to burst out into the alleyway where the last lawman was supposed to be. However, they could see the back of the man maneuvering past the blasted pallets. Since Mason destroyed the barricade, it made it **MUCH** easier for an escape for everyone.

Mason and Rob sprinted out of the alley and onto the street. As they moved away from the facility, the loudest explosion they heard in their lives rocked the earth. The concussion took both of them off of their feet and tumbling as shrapnel and debris threatened to take their very lives away from them. But as fate would have it, they were unharmed.


[1/3/2025 11:27 PM] Rob Upton
Rob tumbled and rolled, his rifle scattering across the ground as he came to rest on his back. His glasses were thrown from his face during the fall. He'd groan as the dull pain from the fall and the ringing in his ears took priority. **"Ugh...."**


[1/3/2025 11:59 PM] Mason Reed
*Mason rolled across the ground as well, anything that was in his hands was no where to be seen and his head felt like it just got rocked to no end.* "Damn..." *When he tried to roll over it only made the pain in his body more apparent, so he just laid there for a bit until the pain decided to dull down.*

"Your body all intact, Rob?" *His speech was slightly slurred, and to be honest he can't really hear what he said all to well because of the ringing.*


[1/4/2025 12:52 AM] Rob Upton
**"I think so...."** He responded after a few labored breaths. **"I don't know..."**


[1/4/2025 11:30 AM] Rob Upton
Rob was the first to sit up after a long while. Through gritted teeth, he was successful. A wince here and a grunt there, Rob began checking their surroundings.

A miracle is what that was. Large debris fell on a parked car just a few meters from them, crushing it where the wheels were popped off.


[1/4/2025 11:30 AM] Narration
The lawman that provided security was also unharmed but out of breath. With his hands on his knees, he panted. Thankful to be alive.


[1/4/2025 11:38 AM] Lt. John
`Units, All Units. Stand down. Mercer isn't here. The bastard was seen in Fairview.`

`I'm going to the second location. Return to your posts. I expect to see reports on my deck by tomorrow morning.`


[1/4/2025 11:38 AM] Narration
Being under John's command was brutal. He has only been there a month and already has Mason noticed a shift in the energy of his post. The signs were all there. Leadership changed, Attitudes were high, Reckless leadership was apparent and a lack of organization was glaring. Just what the hell was going on in the CCR?

**"Finally, I can get away from this nightmare scenario."**

"I'm with you there," *Mason sat up with a grunt while holding his head.* "After writing that report I don't want to see any work for a while." *Normally with missions like these, Mason feels a little satisfied with completing it, but this time it was just pure confusion.*

"This call must've been a trap, or a setup... Everything was so uncoordinated and left up to chance. And as I guessed; Mercer wasn't even in the building."


[1/4/2025 9:08 PM] Rob Upton
**"Careful, Mason."** He'd caution as he crawled to his feet. **"Command would not want to hear that... Lets... go home."**


[1/4/2025 9:12 PM] Rob Upton
**"Fuck....."** He'd mutter under his breath as he extended his hand out to his partner.


[1/4/2025 9:35 PM] Mason Reed
"Yeah..." *Mason grabbed Rob's hand and steadied himself as he stood up. It was obvious that Mason was tired physically and mentally, mainly because this time around the CCR seemed to be a danger to themselves rather than someone else. Gritting his teeth, he decided to put that line of thought in the back of his head for now and grabbed his fallen gun.*

"Hopefully nothing happened to the Enforcer."


[1/4/2025 9:36 PM] Rob Upton
**"Come on, if its good, I'll drive you home."** He'd nudge his head in the direction of their vehicle. His eyes falling on the now burning facility. The rain should help put it out...  eventually.


[1/4/2025 9:50 PM] Mason Reed
"I don't mind driving, but thanks I appreciate it." *After one glance back to the raging fire, Mason turned his head and slightly shook it in disbelief. "Goodness gracious" he thought, ~~but as long as the peak suspension modded Ion Enforcer was fine then that's all that really mattered~~.*
