Across Aurora's Apartment in District 9, on the fourth floor...


[9/15/2025 10:08 PM] Narration
*The mag-lock on Room 412 disengaged with a soft, electronic chime, a sterile sound for a sterile space. As the door slid into the wall, it revealed not darkness, but a cool, blue-grey twilight generated by a wall of monitors. The air that washed over Mason was chilled and unnaturally dry, smelling of ozone, hot metal, and the faint, bitter ghost of burnt synth-caff. This was the scent of obsession.*

*Unlike the chaotic tomb Cole and Cat inhabited, this room was a temple of methodical vigilance. The centerpiece was a massive, high-fidelity screen displaying a live feed of the front of the building, so clear Mason could see the dust motes dancing in the afternoon light slanting through the buildings.*

*flanking the main view were smaller, dedicated monitors. One scrolled with her encrypted network traffic, algorithms working tirelessly to crack the shell of her digital life. The others were in sleep mode, perfect for throwing more views up. A computer terminal dominated the right wall of the room, it's surveillance port open, waiting for someone to insert an drive to begin recording.*

*Mason stepped inside, the door hissing shut behind him.*


[9/15/2025 10:21 PM] Mason Reed
*After making sure that the door was locked tight, his attention went back to the metal covered wall of endless high-quality monitors. This room had everything he needed for the case, and he was by himself, so no one else would be able to see her private life but him. Checking out the monitors to his left showed that he had even more view ports—which he would need considering how many cameras he put up.*

*Satisfied with the sweep of the room, he moved toward the main terminal. Digging into his pocket, Mason retrieved the small drive connected to the bugs he’d planted. Sliding it into the port, he stepped back slightly, watching as the system recognized the device and began pulling in the streams.*


[9/15/2025 10:27 PM] Narration
*Within seconds, the feeds on the additional monitors began populating with live playback footage of the apartment. Capturing angles that would be considered hotspots for any suspicious activity, if there were to be any. The kitchen, the bedroom, the balcony, and the door were also areas under surveillance. There would be very little that could go unnoticed. Now that his base of operations were setup, he had options. He could stay there and watch the playback. Or, he could go investigate his other leads and allow the system to work it's magic. He'd be able to sort from key phrases mentioned, motion, and even detect when those other than the person(s) he whitelist enters the premise of the shots.*


[9/15/2025 10:37 PM] Mason Reed
*With the system running smoothly, Mason could leave it to operate on its own and wait for any activity to surface. Aurora was still likely occupied with streaming for the time being, so he turned his focus toward the leads Heather had brought up earlier in the day. Crossing to the left side of the room, he began pulling up the gathered list of suspects they’d identified aside from Aurora.*

Attached were 6 names.
• Caleb Marris
• Rina Doss
• Oliver Vant
• Monica Bellthrope
• Cipher
• Trent "Runner" Kells

`("These are all of them...")` *He skimmed over each name, weighing his options on where to begin..* `("I already ran into Cipher before with Aurora, so I'll check him out first.")`

*With that decided, he pulled up Cipher’s file to start his investigation.*


[9/16/2025 9:47 PM] Narration
*With a few keystrokes, Mason bypassed the public-facing search engines and dove into the restricted CCR data-archives. Cipher’s public persona was just noise; he needed the signal underneath. A moment later, the file materialized on the screen, its contents painting a far grimmer picture than a simple online rivalry.*

## II. CRIMINAL RECORD & INCIDENT REPORTS ##
• **2252 - Unlawful Broadcast:** Fined for broadcasting a corporate data-breach live. Claimed it was "performance art."
• **2259** - Public Disturbance: Detained and released after a public altercation with rival streamer "AuraQueen."
• **2261** - Formal Accusation (Sexual Assault): An online follower accused Volkov of coercion and assault during a private virtual-reality meetup. The case was dropped due to insufficient evidence and the accuser's retraction of the statement. The public fallout significantly damaged Volkov's reputation and led to his suspension from the Solar Knights pro-league, along with findings of him possessing a modified neural port for exploiting the game servers. Volkov maintains he was the victim of a "deplatforming" setup.

## III. INTELLIGENCE ANALYSIS (CLASSIFIED) ##

Cipher's public persona as a mid-tier, antagonistic streamer is essentially a front for a much deeper, long-standing obsession with Aurora King.

Intel cross-referenced from school records and junior netrunning league archives indicates Volkov and King were members of a short-lived but highly effective netrunning competition team named "Subnet Strikers" (Circa 2255-2257). They were considered a prodigious duo, known for their unorthodox but successful tandem tactics in simulated corporate-run competitions.

The camaraderie publicly dissolved following the Public Disturbance incident on 2259. Deeper analysis of the event's raw security footage shows the altercation with streamer "Hex" was secondary. The primary instigation was a vitriolic, face-to-face argument between Volkov and King moments before. This event marks the first public record of their now-infamous feud.


[9/16/2025 10:00 PM] Narration
Since that incident, they have been at each other's throats. King was the first to launch a mainstream streaming career, achieving rapid success. Volkov immediately followed suit, creating the "Cipher" persona and building his platform almost entirely around his opposition to her. This pattern of behavior has led to two competing analyst hypotheses:

**Hypothesis A (Obsessive Rival):** Volkov's actions are driven by a pathological need to remain in King's orbit. Unable to match her success, he has settled for the role of her primary antagonist. His career is a parasitic imitation of hers, suggesting a deep-seated obsession that could easily escalate.

**Hypothesis B (Covert Alliance):** The feud is an elaborate, long-running performance. The constant public animosity provides perfect cover for them to be covertly working together. Their shared history as a high-functioning team suggests they could be collaborating on objectives that require their public personas to remain entirely separate.

## IV. CURRENT ASSEMENT ##
Regardless of which hypothesis is accurate, Cay "Cipher" Volkov is central to this investigation. His connection to Aurora King is the most significant and long-lasting relationship she has on record.

If **Hypothesis A** is correct, he is an unstable and emotionally compromised individual with a clear motive for stalking, harassment, or sabotage against King. His unpredictability makes him a direct threat to her safety.

If **Hypothesis B** is correct, he is not a suspect in a crime against King, but a co-conspirator with her. The entire feud is misdirection, and he must be considered a primary subject in a potentially larger criminal enterprise.

Recommendation: **__Elevate__** Volkov to a high-priority person of interest. Initiate immediate digital and physical surveillance to determine the true nature of his interactions with King. Ascertaining whether he is her enemy or her accomplice is paramount.

*Mason leaned in closer to the screen, his gaze locked on the endless stream of details. The deeper he read, the more it felt like he was prying into something he was never meant to uncover. Cipher’s file laid out not only his criminal history, but his long-standing connection to Aurora stretching all the way back to their middle school days. Up until yesterday, Mason would’ve assumed they’d only ever crossed paths through streaming. Learning their history went so much further left a sour weight in his chest.*

"**What the hell...**" *Mason's face had a growing look of distain and disgust as he continued reading.*

*Why hadn’t she mentioned this? Maybe it was just another secret she preferred to bury. Though Mason that could also apply to him. Still, seeing the assault allegations in black and white, alongside a altercation with Aurora herself, made the hairs on his arms rise. It gave him even more questions to ponder over. Such as what that situation was even about? What did he do to her?*

*Given how openly she’d voiced her disdain for Cipher yesterday, Hypothesis A seemed the most likely explanation. And that alone made Mason’s blood boil. The details in his file, combined with his past ties to Aurora, set off far too many alarms for Mason to simply brush aside and ignore.*

*This man had no place anywhere near her. The possibility of an obsessive stalker was the last thing Mason wanted circling his life—especially Aurora’s. Without hesitation, he flagged Cipher as a top-priority case. More information would have to be dug up on him as soon as the opportunity arose.*
