When the location is too obscure to locate...


[1/5/2025 4:19 PM] Narration
The camera plunges into a grand chamber of opulence and riches. These colossal tables, oriented meticulously, overwhelm the room.

 The latest technology is embedded in everything. The tabletops have optical displays integrated within them. The chairs are made of tungsten, and the cushions are full to bursting and made of velvet. The floor is like a mirror, perfectly reflecting what is above it, revealing intricate arch designs on the ceiling.

 Servants line the room's length, each standing at the same height, having the same build, and sharing the same assortment of cybernetics as their neighbors. Symmetrically in line with the servants, digital banners cascade down the height of the walls. The CCR insignia was modified and embellished.

Aside from the servants, the attendees occupied this room and filled most of the seats. Auditorily, the visitors' murmuring filled the large gathering hall with civilized conversation. Most of the men and women were of the "Upper echelon." They were dressed in shimmering dresses and the latest and greatest pressed suits that blended effortlessly, integrating with the cybernetic enhancements of both sexes. Appetizers were abundant, allowing the guests to choose from an assortment of snacks and gave an overall heightened enthusiasm for those within the confines of the walls.

On the far end of this room stands a shorter table, turned perpendicularly and positioned more elevated than the rest. The lone table gives a sense of higher authority...


[1/5/2025 4:58 PM] Rhett D'arch
Amidst the crowd of guests, Rhett was wearing a perfectly tailored black suit. His gaze was fixed on a table at the far end of the hall as if he were engaged in a silent battle with it. Something about the table's presence made him pause, though he had lost track of how long he had been doing so. **"..."**

Subtle music filled spaces where sentences and conversation found moments of silence. Creating a continuous and endless stream of sound.


[1/5/2025 4:58 PM] Lt. Heather Bailey
**"How much longer are you just going to keep looking?"** Heather's question broke the man's moment of isolation and brought him back to reality. Heather herself was wearing a cut charcoal grey dress. The sufficient light that brightened the room shimmered off the metallic flakes. Just after she asked the question, she slowly brought her drink to her lips, taking a measured sip of the red liquid.


[1/5/2025 4:58 PM] Rhett D'arch
With a slow and drawn-out exhale, Rhett brought his weight centered with his chair but kept his eyes on the reason for his focus for a moment later before peeling his gaze away and allowing it to rest upon the top of the table in front of him. Then, there was a pause before he turned his attention towards the recently promoted lieutenant's eyes. **"As long as it takes."**

His gaze moved down to her hand, focusing particularly on the drink she was holding. **"You seem surprisingly lax, especially in light of the recent assault on the Fairview station a few days back. What‚Äôs your secret? Is it the drink?"** He asked with a bit of sarcasm. However, the amusement that could be inferred from it never reached his eyes.


[1/5/2025 5:17 PM] Lt. Heather Bailey
Heather rolled her eyes and placed her drink on the coaster. Rhett was such a pain, always hitting her with those sarcastic comments whenever things did not go his way. With a flare of her nostrils, as she sharply exhaled, Heather shook her head, trying to convince her annoying locks to find refuge somewhere other than her forehead. **"Oh, no,"** she said with mock seriousness. **"I don't drink nearly enough to calm my nerves. I just prefer to keep my feelings off my sleeves, thank you."**


[1/5/2025 5:17 PM] Narration
The subtle tension between the two dissipated almost instantly. There was no real hostility between them; it was merely their way of coping with the stress of the gathering.


[1/5/2025 5:17 PM] Lt. Heather Bailey
**If Hilton hadn‚Äôt been zeroed, I would be home now, enjoying a work-from-home day and rummaging through patrol reports. I would have earned three hours of vacation time, yet here I am, forced to appear beside you and pretend that I have the Horizon Grey situation under control."** She seethed, her teeth clenched tight.


[1/5/2025 5:28 PM] Rhett D'arch
**"I find it surprising that they took such a reckless risk. I had anticipated they would strive to handle the situation far more discreetly."**


[1/5/2025 5:28 PM] Lt. Heather Bailey
Heather agreed, saying, **"You and me both..."**


[1/5/2025 5:32 PM] Rhett D'arch
Rhett observed that the atmosphere in the room was beginning to change. Everyone was drawn to the side of the room he had been focused on moments ago. This prompted the man to also turn his focus in the general direction, followed shortly by Heather.


[1/5/2025 5:45 PM] Narration
The music in the room ended, and the conversations gradually faded away. Twelve individuals emerged from a set of double doors at the side of the hall. Silence enveloped the room as they took their places at the raised platform. The man in the center was the last to be seated, appearing younger than everyone else.

Optical projects emitted from the display outlets aligned in the center were found on each table within the room. If they were spaced evenly, duplicate projections could be found every five or so seats.


[1/5/2025 6:04 PM] Director Aldric
**"Good afternoon,"** The man-centered in the holographic display leaned back in his seat, arms spread to each side of him, palms upwards. His voice comes to everyone clearly.

**"Officials, Agents, Lawmen,"**


[1/5/2025 6:04 PM] Quincy
Quincy was in attendance, surrounded by other CCR officials like himself.


[1/5/2025 6:04 PM] Rhett D'arch
Rhett folded his hands underneath the table, bouncing his foot with his toes. He maintained a pointed demeanor as he listened to this man speak.


[1/5/2025 6:04 PM] Lt. Heather Bailey
Subtly, Heather chewed on the inside of her bottom lip. Remaining attentive to the proceedings.


[1/5/2025 6:04 PM] Director Aldric
**"Constituents, Partners  ‚ÄîFriends"**


[1/5/2025 6:04 PM] Benedict
He was with his secretaries, prepared to transcribe. Benedict crossed his arms and did not even look at the display; his thoughts were elsewhere.


[1/5/2025 6:04 PM] Dyle Bucknic
Dyle appeared bored; with his legs crossed, he watched the display with slight amusement.

[1/5/2025 6:53 PM] Director Aldric
**"Thank you, all, for being willing to attend this ‚Äîimpromptu gathering. After compiling the most recent metrics and following trends regarding the current state of the happenings in my beloved asylum, I have found it important to summon everyone here so we may have __dialogue__."**

Aldric leaned to one side of his chair, propping himself up with his arm. **"Progress has been made to unify my district and ensure profits for the shareholders who invested in my vision. However, I have grown dissatisfied with the pacing of this progress. This is evident in my decision to overrule the Haven Height lockdown."**

**"The economic fall-out from the lockdown has been a nightmare for companies that profit off the movement of goods, which is approximately 37% of District 9, Thamesford's profits. This is all part of poor decision-making, egregious middle management, and the lack of ethics that those I employ possess. To my constituents, partners, and friends... I'm sorry for my absence of action. I put our trust in harm's way and relied on a system built to ensure seamless integration. Not knowing that the system itself was failing unbeknownst to even themselves."**


[1/5/2025 6:53 PM] Rhett D'arch
He furrowed his brow. `"The nerves...Throwing us CCR under the bus to appease this corpo. If it wasn't for us, these fools wouldn't be in the position they are in now."`


[1/5/2025 6:53 PM] Director Aldric
**"As many of you know, changes are coming. The most significant change has been tested in three different Vesperian cities, and we have successfully undergone stress testing at our very own Neon Kyrie. The Neural Network Surveillance System (NNSS) allows us to monitor and correct deviant behavior that disrupts the daily life cycle of our economy and military. This effort will be conducted by the Vesperian Legion on behalf of the CCR."**

**"It has been shown repeatedly that the Legion's method in Monita is more robust and effective. As such, I have been working with the wardens of Districts 10, 8, and 4 on adopting their conduct into our internal security forces. At the turn of the new year, the CCR will be better and more efficient at stopping cyber theft and handling internal terroristic threats that we unfortunately face today."**

*Can they be not better at stopping cyber theft? Thank you*

[1/28/2025 10:58 PM] Director Aldric
Aldric paused, picking up his glass. **"Those within the CCR will answer directly to the Legion in the coming days. Reform is necessary to preserve our way of life and to brace ourselves for the next __trials__ ahead of us."** He would then take another sip of his drink. Slowly, he would swallow, Savoring the taste and feeling. **"Any objections?"**


[1/28/2025 10:58 PM] Narration
As anyone would expect, there were none.


[1/28/2025 10:58 PM] Director Aldric
**"Please, enjoy the meals that have been prepared for you. As always, you all can speak with me about __anything..__"**

Some time later, we come across a private longue, filled with an exquisite blend of opulence and high technology, much like Aldric himself. Director Aldric sat in a plush chair, upholstered in rich leather, gently stroking a exotic feline whose fur shimmered under the lounge's subtle lighting. 

The creature was clearly a marvel of genetic manipulation, with luminous bioluminescent patterns cascading across its coat, its eyes glowing softly in shifting hues, each blink cycling between colors of neon blues and electric violets.

[4/10/2025 10:55 PM] Narration
The quiet hum of machinery served as a backdrop when Benedict and Dyle entered the lounge.


[4/10/2025 10:55 PM] Benedict
Benedict's eyes sparkled with sinister amusement, a perpetual smirk curling at the edges of his lips, for whatever reason.


[4/10/2025 10:55 PM] Dyle Bucknic
Dyle constrastingly sober and analytical, carried a datapad, its display softly illuminating against his suit jacket, the light shimmering off of the flaked-like patterns.


[4/10/2025 10:55 PM] Director Aldric
**"Gentlemen,"** Aldric began calmly, his voice smooth and reassuring. **"Welcome. Sit, let's discuss indepth the concerns that plague our district."**


[4/10/2025 10:55 PM] Benedict
Benedict sank leeisurely into a chair opposite Aldric, barely concealing a sneer. **"The Legion is stumbling outside District 9."** he noted dryly, crossing one leg over the other. **"Brillion's forces have pushed dangerously close to London. Are we to merely observe our slow demise, Aldric?"**

[4/10/2025 10:55 PM] Director Aldric
Aldric chuckled softly, maintaining his composure. **"Always the dramatist, Benedict. Rest assured, our strategy is meticulously planned."** His fingers absently traced the patterns into the cat's shimmering fur, eliciting a satisfied purr from the creature. **"The exarchs we've embedded within the population, alongeside the installed firmware, will provide adequate contigency when the inevitable occurs."**


[4/10/2025 10:57 PM] Dyle Bucknic
Dyle shifted slightly in his seat, clearing his throat quietly. **"Director, our research has been significantly impeded by CCR interference. Losing Stephanie, Danny Donovan, and Fred Dawson's full cooperation at this juncture is less than ideal. It has come to my attention that the CCR had planted seeds of fear into my employees. Recovering their loyalty should be paramount before the extraction."**


[4/10/2025 11:01 PM] Director Aldric
**"Agreed, Dyle,"** Aldric responded thoughtfully. **"But patience is key. Once safetly relocated to District 5, you'll resume your critical work unhindered. The Donovans and Dawsons will return to our fold‚Äîrest assured, it's merely a matter of timing."**


[4/10/2025 11:01 PM] Dyle Bucknic
Dyle gave pause before throwing a hypothetical, **"If they are caught up in the fighting?"**


[4/10/2025 11:01 PM] Director Aldric
**"I find those individuals rather... resourceful. I can hardly think they would find themselves succumbing to this *'minor inconvience'*."**


[4/10/2025 11:04 PM] Benedict
Benedict's fingers tapped impatiently against his thigh. **"I find it amusing,"** he said icily, **"how you can remain so collected, Director. The stakes here could not be higher."**


[4/10/2025 11:04 PM] Director Aldric
Aldric's smile widened faintly, eyes glittering with insight. **"Composure, Benedict, is precisely how one ensures victory. Panic breeds mistakes. Mistakes manifests failed realizations, after all."** The cat stretched, its bioluminescent stripes glowing brighter momentairly, casting surreal patterns across Aldric's calm face. **"Your task remains unchanged: combat Brillion's threat. Focus on that and let me handle the rest."**


[4/14/2025 11:05 AM] Narration
Far from the luxury of Aldric's longue and in the presence of those in the main dining hall...


[4/14/2025 11:05 AM] Quincy
Quincy remained neutral faced. His glowing eyes focused on the expensive wine before him‚Äîuntouched. He remained this way in inimtated bordeom, discreetly eavesdropping through a carefully accessed internal feed displayed subtly across the interface of his cyber-optics. 

A wry smirk tugged at the corner of his mouth as he listened in on Aldric, Benedict, and Dyle. His fingertips tapped rhythmically on the bend of his elbow‚Äîarms crossed; Each tap punctuated by silent, self-assured amusement.

`("Oh please...)"` Quincy thought to himself, condescension in his own head. `("You really think composure alone will save your sinking ship, Aldric?")` His eyes snapped open, glittering with an arrogant satisfaction. `("This all plays out exactly as I predicted. How quaint.")`


[4/14/2025 11:11 AM] Quincy
He scanned the immedate surroundings, checking if anyone noticed his amusement, but the attendees remained oblicious, lost in their own shallow exchanges. Quincy's eyes illuminated just a bit brighter, opening a direct comm line, encrypted and private. He would have to thank his *favorite* netrunner for getting a encryption key later...

After a brief shirp, the connection clicked open.

`"Slade,"` Quincy said, his voice smug and measured. 

*"..."*

`"Everything I surmised is coming true. Aldric's prepping to flee District 9. He's planning to trigger that 'firmware' on the populance, just as I perdicted."`

*"..."*

He paused, rolling his eyes as if the situation were almost beneath him to discuss. `"We need to secure the data from our delightful little minx before Brillion assaults District 9."` 

*"..."*

`"Currently, she is brain dead without the reversal spike. I will see about conscripting another lacky to reverse the spike."` 

*"..."*

`"Oh, and don't forget‚Äî Dawson's prototype is nearly operational. It's critical we get the learned data first..." 

*"..."*

`"Aldric and Dyle might have plans, but you forget who you're talking to; I've been two steps ahead from the start. Keep the Donovans on a tight leash... To think they allowed their assets to be poached this late in the game. Amateurs."`

*"..."*

A smile spread slowly across Quincy's face. `"I'll keep an eye on things here‚Äîclearly, someone competent has to."` The comm channel chirped closed. Quincy leaned back, feigning casual boredom once again, entirely satisifed.
