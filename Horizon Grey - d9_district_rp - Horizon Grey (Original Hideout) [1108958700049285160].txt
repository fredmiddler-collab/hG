[5/18/2023 11:30 PM] Cat Bayes
**...'Infamous' Horizon Grey HQ, huh?"** *Cat's voice echoed into underground bunker as she made her way down the ladder, hopping off at the last step as she eagerly examined her surroundings.*


[5/18/2023 11:31 PM] Narration
Siting in the chair in the far side of the room. None other than Mathias gazed upon Cat. Seemed like someone was not the happiest to see her.


[5/18/2023 11:31 PM] Paige
**"Sure is."** She would be close behind Cat, coming off of the ladder.


[5/18/2023 11:32 PM] Cat Bayes
**"Holy fucking shit, is that-"**


[5/18/2023 11:33 PM] Mathias
**"Who is this and why the hell did you bring them here Paige?"** He would say, if one was paying attention, he had an revolver's barrel poking out from underneath the arm that laid on the table to support his head.

[5/18/2023 11:36 PM] Paige
**"Relax Mathias, this is Cat. She's harmless to us."** She would go on to say, **"You can have a seat anywhere Cat."**


[5/18/2023 11:38 PM] Mathias
He would stand up, hands pressed flat against the table. His revolver underneath his offhand. **"I recall giving you clear instruction __NOT__ to bring anyone of your friends here."**


[5/18/2023 11:41 PM] Cat Bayes
**"Are you sure? It kinda looks like he'll shoot me if I move..."** *She whispered to Cat, her hands still up in the air.*


[5/18/2023 11:43 PM] Paige
**"Don't worry, he is a teddy bear."** She would walk towards Mathias. **"She is more than a friend, Mat. She is our only hope if we are to revive—"**


[5/18/2023 11:43 PM] Mathias
**"Enough with that revival bullshit. Horizon is over, done with, finished, and has no chance of returning. You need to accept that and move on. We can't keep hoping for a miraculous resurrection; it's time to give up on this."**


[5/18/2023 11:49 PM] Cat Bayes
**"...Wait, what? What are you talking about?"** *She gave her friend a confused look, was this really the legendary leader of the once famed group of outlaws that rose against the iron fist of the CCR? Now that she got a better look at him...He just looked like a drunkard, ready to lie down and die at any given time.*

**"Horizon is finished? What sort of bullshit are you spouting dude?"** *It almost felt insulting to hear him say that, knowing the kind of suffering that the Corpos and CCR alike were putting the people of Vespera through.*


[5/18/2023 11:54 PM] Mathias
He turned his attention to Cat. Moving from the chair **"You have no idea what you are saying."**


[5/18/2023 11:54 PM] Paige
**"Mathias, stop running like a bitch. It won't work. We owe it to everyone who died for this cause to keep fighting. You think you can turn your back on Aryan, Ronan, Felicity?"** Stepping in between Mathias and Cat. **"I'm sick and __TIRED__ of seeing you like this...Years ago, you would be running headlong into danger. Sticking it to the CCR and showing the people what true freedom looked like. Now, look at you. You're pathetic, choomba. You much rather waste away and drink your failures away instead of avenge your family."**

She would shove him back. **"Enough alright?!"**


[5/18/2023 11:56 PM] Paige
**"You saved me bro! You could have saved anyone else. People far more talented and respect than me but you chose me!"**


[5/18/2023 11:56 PM] Paige
**"Why?"**


[5/18/2023 11:57 PM] Paige
**"What's the point of saving what's left if you're just going to waste away."** She would turn from him **"I'm not going to sit here and suffer that same fate."**


[5/18/2023 11:58 PM] Mathias
He remained silent. All throughout her spew, he looked down at her with narrow eyes but not once speaking. His tongue shifting from one side to the other as he refrained from going into an outburst.


[5/18/2023 11:59 PM] Cat Bayes
*Cat was about to retort to the druken man before she was suddenly cut off by Paige's outburst, looking over at her with a bit of surprise...She's never seen her this angry before, watching as she tore into the man's self esteem if he had any left.*

**"..."** *Aryan, Ronan, Felicity...Must've been some old members who died during the collapse...and Matthias saved her? There was a lot of history she was missing out here, he was right, she had no idea what she was talking about...but she couldn't back down either.*


[5/19/2023 12:01 AM] Cat Bayes
**"I'm sorry choom...I know this shit must be tough for you, but I just watched twelve people die while I was forced to watch."** *She stepped forward.*

**"All from a fucking corpo, the same fuckers who the CCR happily let do their own fucking shit without any consequence."**


[5/19/2023 12:03 AM] Cat Bayes
**"It may have been my fault they died, but I should've been the one to pay for it, not them."** *That spark of rage was rising in her throat again, if she wasn't careful, it could ignite and become a raging inferno.* **"And yet I'm still here. I'm, still, here."**


[5/19/2023 12:03 AM] Paige
Stood on the far side of the room, arms crossed and look off to the side. Clearly releasing a lot of pent up feelings and just playing the feeling and the words over in her head on loop. **". . ."**


[5/19/2023 12:05 AM] Mathias
Mathias stepped back, his shoulders slouched a bit before turning his back to the two. **"What is it you do?"** He asked as he went to retrieve his revolver from the table.


[5/19/2023 12:06 AM] Cat Bayes
**"..."** *She closed her eyes and sighed, the tenseness in her body somewhat relaxing.* **"...I'm a netrunner."**


[5/19/2023 12:07 AM] Mathias
Once he reached the revolver, he would hold it by the nose and handle with both hands. Turned to the side, he would release the hand holding the handle and would toss it towards Cat.


[5/19/2023 12:10 AM] Cat Bayes
**"Woah!- Guh!"** *Cat fumbled a bit, accidentally slapping it around in the air a bit before finally catching it.* **"A...gun?"**


[5/19/2023 12:10 AM] Mathias
**"You'll need that if you're going to help Paige rebuild."** He would step off into the next room.


[5/19/2023 12:11 AM] Paige
Hearing that, she would raise her eyes and turn towards Mathias. **"Mathias, that's not what I-...UGH!"** She would exasperate pounding her fist against the wall once.


[5/19/2023 12:13 AM] Cat Bayes
*The girl examined the gun for a few moments before looking over to her friend.* **"Uh...I guess...this means I'm in?"**


[5/19/2023 12:16 AM] Paige
Paige took a moment to breathe, nodding in response to Cat's question **"Yeah, you're in."**

Still coming off the high of emotions, Paige took a few moments of pacing around before proceeding. **"There is a lot to do, but, now is not the time to be worrying about it. We still got to get you settled in and get you gear so you can net run."**


[5/19/2023 12:19 AM] Cat Bayes
**"...Shit, Pags I..."** *To be fair, she was still coming down from her own emotional high, taking a moment to breathe, she looked over at her friend.* **"Thank you."**


[5/19/2023 12:20 AM] Paige
**"What can I say? I said I would have your back no matter what. That's what friends do."**

{Reactions}
Really reallynow

[5/19/2023 12:23 AM] Cat Bayes
**"Hehe."** *She held the handle of the gun in both of her hands as she leaned her butt against the edge of the table.* **"It's good to have friends."** *She said with a huff.*


[5/19/2023 12:24 AM] Paige
**"Sure is... And when we turn this situation round, we'll be making more friends and kicking more ass in the process.... Just like the good old days."** She'd pause before laughing. **"I sound old as shit, huh?"**


[5/19/2023 12:24 AM] Cat Bayes
**"Just a bit, yeah."** *She chuckled.*


[5/19/2023 12:28 AM] Paige
Paige is a pacer, must be a habit. **"Been in rollin' with Horizon since eleven. Thirteen years of dodging CCR assholes and sticking it to bounty hunters."**


[5/19/2023 12:29 AM] Cat Bayes
**"Jesus, you've been doing this for over a decade? You really are old!"** *She teased!* **"But seriously, that's a long time to be in a revolution for...were you ever scared?"**


[5/19/2023 12:30 AM] Paige
**"Pfft, scared?"** She would pick up something from the counter opposite of Cat, it was a collapsible baton that she fiddled with. **"Scared shitless."**


[5/19/2023 12:33 AM] Paige
She would not leave it at that! **"But in an exciting kind of way. Horizon was much bigger then. Multiple cells operating out of almost every district. We could freely travel from one district to the next. Getting involved in shootouts with the Feds, Corpos, undoing their regimes and giving it all back to the people who built this top heavy society... It felt amazing."**


[5/19/2023 12:33 AM] Paige
**"Each time, I was scared shitless."**


[5/19/2023 12:33 AM] Paige
**"But each time... There was Mathias..."**


[5/19/2023 12:36 AM] Paige
**"He is what kept me going back."**


[5/19/2023 12:37 AM] Cat Bayes
*Cat smiled as she listened to her story, brushing her dark blue hair to the side.* **"Y'sound like you really look up to the guy...hell, even now, you still respect him right?"**


[5/19/2023 12:37 AM] Mathias
Mathias was on the opposite side of the wall, listening. His head looking up to the ceiling. Clearly the others did not know he was listening!

sus

[5/19/2023 12:41 AM] Paige
**"Yeah....I do."** Paige sat the baton back down. **"You've had a long day. I can only imagine how exhausted you are right now."** She would nod her head to the right, gesturing to the doorway. **"There are a few spare rooms, pick one and take it easy for a little bit. I will keep my ears open for any leads on the equipment you may need."**


[5/19/2023 12:48 AM] Cat Bayes
*Now that she mentioned it, she hadn't gotten any sleep ever since...All at once the exhaustion caught up with her and she gave Paige a long blink before standing up with a yawn.* **"Yaaaah...Yeah, I think I'll go do that...Again, thank you Pags, you're the best friend a girl's got."**


[5/19/2023 12:49 AM] Paige
Paige glanced over towards Cat with a smirk on her face. **"You bet."**


[5/19/2023 6:54 PM] Narration
It has been a few days since Cat had finally been accepted into Horizon Grey. Mathias has been dormant for that time, not necessarily interacting with Paige or Cat. Tension was there, but not an immediate issue that needed urgent resolution. 

Cat was just leaving her room and heading to the main living area.


[5/19/2023 7:03 PM] Cat Bayes
*Scratching the back of her head with a yawn, Horizon Grey's new resident Netrunner entered the main living area and examined her surroundings. Were either of the other members currently awake?*


[5/19/2023 7:07 PM] Paige
Paige was standing at the center most table, looking over some things on a sketch pad. Her eyes lifted towards Cat the moment she came into view. **"Just the person I wanted to see."**


[5/19/2023 7:10 PM] Cat Bayes
*Ah, Paige was up bright and early it seemed! Giving her friend a tired smile, she held up a peace-sign as she walked over.* **"Yeoooo."**

**"You said you needed to see me?"**


[5/19/2023 7:13 PM] Paige
**"You know it."** Pushing off of the table with her hands, she would walk around it swinging her hands as she neared Cat. **"Finding a tub was easy, lifted one from this abandoned house nearby. Mathias was so kind enough to go get it. He's out now actually."**


[5/19/2023 7:14 PM] Cat Bayes
**"Shit, is he gonna be alright? Dude's got one of the most recognizable face in the city."**


[5/19/2023 7:16 PM] Paige
**"Mathias can handle himself, his cybernetics are prem and he knows how to sneak around a neighborhood."** She'd clasp her hands together. **"We on the other hand have the harder job."**


[5/19/2023 7:17 PM] Cat Bayes
*She nodded.* **"Wouldn't have it any other way, what's the beat?"**


[5/19/2023 7:20 PM] Paige
**"We need to get your hookups and terminal sys so that you can do your thing. We could lift some, but we'd probably be killed in the process. Not exactly just lying around waiting for some baddies such as ourselves to repurpose."** She would lean against the wall, arms folded.
**"Leaving us with two options. Option one, which also comes with some problems."** Holding out her index, **"One, we not exactly have the micros."** Now the middle finger, **"Two, anything I buy would raise alarms so far and wide that I might as well zero myself."**


[5/19/2023 7:24 PM] Paige
**"A solution would be for you to purchase everything from the Metro. You're not on the radar which helps us immensely."**


[5/19/2023 7:25 PM] Paige
**"Second option is that I do some old Indie's a favor. Did not part ways with them in the best of ways. Bad biz, you dig?"**


[5/19/2023 7:27 PM] Paige
**"Which can also tie into option one. Help out some old Indie contacts that I had, earn some micros and buy the gear. Or, we can go out and go on a chopping spree, stealing people's chips and selling them. Your call."**


[5/19/2023 7:36 PM] Cat Bayes
*Cat leaned against the table and weighed their options, tapping her finger on her arm.* **"Mmmh, alright..."**

*Now it was her turn for the fingers!* **"Chopping spree is definitely a no-go at the moment, one small fuck-up and we've got the CCR on our ass, and we're still way too small to afford a confrontation with them."**

*The next finger.* **"On the other hand, putting some favors in can net us some friends in the long run, potentially clear up some future enemies too if you had bad biz with them."** *That was honestly it for the fingers, now pocketing her hands.* **"As for some other gear...I'm gonna need to start running with a decent Operating System and load it up with a modded Cyberdeck if I wanna join you guys on the field."**


[5/19/2023 7:36 PM] Cat Bayes
**"But for that...we're gonna need a ripper doc, and a damned good one too."**


[5/19/2023 7:39 PM] Paige
**"Unfortunately, all the ones I trust either are dead or have been vetted by some corpos. Then I suppose getting back on good terms with the Indie's is the way to go."** She would sigh, **"This is going to be interesting to say the least."**


[5/19/2023 7:40 PM] Cat Bayes
**"Look on the bright side, you'll have me going along with ya!"** *She chuckled, standing as she gave Paige a pat on the back.*


[5/19/2023 7:48 PM] Paige
**"Yeah? Well we are going for a drive then."** She would reach into her shorts pocket and pull out a flash drive looking car key from her back pocket.


[5/19/2023 7:54 PM] Cat Bayes
**"Why Pags, I believe this is the first time you offered to drive me somewhere!~"** *Cat said in a teasing voice, bumping her butt against the table she was leaning on and walking towards the hatch.*


[5/19/2023 7:54 PM] Paige
**"Consider this the first date."**


[5/19/2023 7:54 PM] Cat Bayes
**"Damn, not even gonna take me to dinner for?"**


[5/19/2023 7:56 PM] Paige
**"Do I look like someone who plays by the rules? Haha, forget about that."**  She would jump up onto the ladder leading up to the surface.


[5/19/2023 7:59 PM] Cat Bayes
**"Noted."** *She'd follow close behind!*

[5/30/2023 11:59 PM] Narration
After a good night's rest from a long day, Paige and Cat returned to the hideout in one piece. Due to the recent incident, Littleton was currently in the spotlight, therefore it was crucial that they move with purpose in order to avoid further conflict.


[5/31/2023 8:26 PM] Paige
Being the first down the hatch, Paige exhaled deeply once she leaped off the third peg onto the ground. Finally, returning to familiarity. After a few strides in, she would notice Mathias.


[5/31/2023 8:26 PM] Mathias
Sitting with his arms crossed and head tilted to the side, he gave her that, 'where have you've been' gaze.

[5/31/2023 8:29 PM] Cat Bayes
*Cat was not far behind, seemingly feeling much better after having rested up at the club. Making it down the ladder, she turned to find the rather agitated looking Mathias looking at the two, her proud joy of a job well done immediately turning to the kinda shame you’d feel when your parent was scolding you...something she was well accustomed to.*


[5/31/2023 8:36 PM] Mathias
**"Party late?"** He'd ask, shuffling his feet around


[5/31/2023 8:38 PM] Cat Bayes
**"...Well, technically speaking..."** *Cat started.*


[5/31/2023 8:39 PM] Paige
**"I guess you could say that."** She would say in sync with Cat. She would take the vest she wore off and sat it on the table. Along with the rifle.


[5/31/2023 8:41 PM] Paige
**"Had a bit of a run in with __some part timers__... And the CCR."**


[5/31/2023 8:43 PM] Mathias
Clearing his throat, Mathias uncrossed one arm to pick up his canteen. **"So I've heard, lot of noise going on in Littleton. Sirens, radio chatter and increased drone activity."**


[5/31/2023 8:44 PM] Paige
She would smirk, looking over her shoulder towards Cat, **"You mind waiting in the other room? Talk to you in a bit."**


[5/31/2023 8:45 PM] Cat Bayes
*Cat looked towards Mathias, then back at Paige before clearing her throat.* **"Uh...yeah, see you in a sec."**

*With that, Cat walked on over towards the other room and closed the door...putting her back to it.*


[5/31/2023 8:48 PM] Paige
It took Paige half an hour to emerge from the room adjacent to Cat's. Paige poked her head in, her ponytail flipping to the other side of her head. **"Hey sis."**

{Reactions}
❤️

[5/31/2023 8:55 PM] Cat Bayes
*In that half hour, Cat had found a chair to sit down in and was currently chillin out!* **"Heya Pags!...Did uh...Mathias rag on ya too hard?"**


[5/31/2023 9:03 PM] Paige
**"Not too bad."** Sliding into the room and closing door. **"Good ole Mat isn't the angry type. Even if he is now an old geezer."**


[5/31/2023 9:07 PM] Cat Bayes
**"Heh, tough girl."** *She chuckled, standing from the chair.* **"How're you doing by the way? We didn't have much time to talk about...last night...on the way back here."**


[5/31/2023 9:09 PM] Paige
**"Today? great. As they used to say, a new day is a new Paige. Yesterday though, Fucking sucked."** She would lean on the back of a chair, one hand on her hip.


[5/31/2023 9:13 PM] Cat Bayes
**"Fuckin felt there, sis."** *Cat gave her friend a smile.* **"Shit, was it always like that back in the day?"**


[5/31/2023 9:28 PM] Paige
She rocked her head side to side **"On occasion ... We had teams in almost every district so hearing about shit happening was not a surprise."**


[5/31/2023 9:29 PM] Paige
**"They always varied too, but under normal circumstances you are never out there __alone.__"**


[5/31/2023 9:36 PM] Cat Bayes
*She nodded her head...the events of last night repeating in her mind for a few moments. She remembered feeling the extremity of the whole situation when Paige told her she had to delta, and the anxiety inducing thought that was constantly nagging at the back of her head...that her best friend was gonna die alone.*

**"As we are right now...we're just spread out too thin. We got lucky last night that we were together, but what if it happens again when one of us are on our own?"** *She still remembered the massive bounty they'd put on Paige's head.* **"They put over __*two million micros*__ out for your head, Paige...That...was fucking crazy."**


[5/31/2023 9:43 PM] Paige
**"That's it?"** She looked almost offended. **"—Oh, well nevermind that... It was just enough to get some big bounty hunters in the district to create a scene. Making it easier for the CCR to act."** She would pull the chair around so that she could sit across from Cat. **"But you're right, I've been making an effort in trying to find people. Though, just getting __anyone__ isn't the solution either."**


[5/31/2023 9:44 PM] Paige
**"In fact, I think I found someone."**

{Reactions}
Really

[5/31/2023 9:48 PM] Cat Bayes
**"...Wait, you're not talking about-"** *Well, that didn't take long for her to put two and two together!* **"...No way...I mean, I agree that dude was a bit of a badass when he __*wasn't trying to kill you*__...but...he did end up losing his bounty hunter job over us...Fuck man, Mathias is gonna kill us..."**


[5/31/2023 9:52 PM] Paige
**"The CCR wants to kill him as much as they want me killed— Ok, maybe not as badly but you get my point!"**


[5/31/2023 9:54 PM] Cat Bayes
**"...Shit girl, I knew you had some massive fucking balls, but now you're telling me they're made of chrome?"** *She chuckled in disbelief, placing her palm on her forehead as she shook her head.*

**"Fuck it, I'm all here for zero accountability...I'm gonna guess Mathias doesn't know?"**


[5/31/2023 9:56 PM] Paige
**"What he doesn't know can't kill him. Besides, I'm sure our acquaintance won't want to room with a old fart and two girls out of his league anyways."** She'd tease.


[5/31/2023 9:57 PM] Paige
**"We are all about risks. Without them, we are nothing."**


[5/31/2023 9:57 PM] Cat Bayes
**"Heh, fucking riiiiight."** *Walking forward, she raised her hand for a high five.*

**"So, when are you picking this choomba up?"**


[5/31/2023 9:58 PM] Paige
**"Don't know, gave him my number. Just waiting on that text back. Not often I give guys my number so he better fucking call."**

[5/31/2023 10:09 PM] Paige
She would answer, **"I wonder who called?"** She said with a bit of sarcasim.


[5/31/2023 10:10 PM] Paige
**"..."** There was pause, her eyes looking up, then to the right. **"South side of Littleton. The old cell tower by Grog's Elysium. Can you manage that in two hours?"**


[5/31/2023 10:11 PM] Paige
The call would end, pushing in the chair towards the table. **"Looks like I got a date. Just can't sit still for more than an hour anymore."**

**"Y'know what they say, no rest for the wicked and all that jazz."** *She said with a teasing smirk, moving about with dramatic flair.* **"But I can't believe it, her first date! Oooh how they grow up so fast!"**


[5/31/2023 10:34 PM] Paige
**"Want to come with?"** She would ask


[5/31/2023 10:57 PM] Cat Bayes
**"On your first date, why I could nevah!"** *She chuckled.* **"But no seriously, I won't be any good as back-up, I still need to cool off my cyberware after the stunt I pulled last night...I'll stay here and keep Matty off your back."**


[5/31/2023 10:58 PM] Paige
**"If you insist!"** She would say with a bit of exaggeration. Throwing her head back. **"What kind of mischief will get myself into this time!"** She could be heard saying as she vanished beyond the door.


[5/31/2023 11:00 PM] Cat Bayes
**"Too much mischief and you call me, I'll come a-running!"** *She called out as Paige left the room!*


[5/31/2023 11:10 PM] Narration
And there Cat was, sitting by her lonesome.. For who knows how long? Perhaps she could seek entertainment?


[6/1/2023 11:11 PM] Cat Bayes
*Huh...for the first time in what felt like a while, Cat was actually bored for once! Ever since joining Horizon Grey, she'd been following Paige's lead and going on all sorts of wacky adventures but now...Huh, was there anything to do around here?*


[6/1/2023 11:22 PM] Narration
There was a few things that Cat could do!..?

In one corner, a bank of ancient computers hums quietly, their screens flickering with incomprehensible lines of code. The keyboards are yellowed with age and use, and each keystroke emits a hollow echo that seems to reverberate off the cold, concrete walls.

On the opposite side of the room, a makeshift workbench is scattered with an assortment of parts, both mechanical and electronic. A pair of discarded goggles and a soldering iron suggest recent activity. Near the bench, a wall-mounted rack holds a variety of tools, each coated in a thin layer of grime and grease.

It is also a possibility that she could speak with Mathias!


[6/1/2023 11:35 PM] Cat Bayes
**"Mmmh..."** *Putting her finger to her lips, she considered her options...*

*First up! Those computers got her attention pretty quickly...she remembered seeing those type of models back when she was a little girl in school...she also remembered her father yelling at her for getting in trouble after messing with them. Cat walked on over towards the old computer, examining it for a moment...it looked pretty archaic, but was it still functional? Deciding to test her theory, she poked around on the keyboard a bit!*


[6/1/2023 11:43 PM] Narration
Some keys were missing, the arrow keys for one. All been picked off of the board. Another key that was missing was the the F5 key. Huh.
Upon interfacing with the keyboard, the nonsense would wipe clean, presenting a console and a open line for commands
```

```


[6/1/2023 11:45 PM] Cat Bayes
**"Mmmh..."** *Well that was interesting, now she was all the more curious...she decided to test something...*

```>.bash_history```


[6/1/2023 11:56 PM] Narration
It appears that the previous user of this computer was trying to decrypt a set of obscured coordinates. The output was a hexadecimal string. Hmm..

[6/2/2023 12:11 AM] Cat Bayes
**"Huh...coordinates?"** *And it was stored in a .txt file as well...welp! Let's run a search for the directory where that file is stored shall we?*

```>src dir coordinates.txt```


[6/2/2023 12:13 AM] Narration
The system would find it's match and the txt file would open. 
```lua
27.5643 N, 152.7893 W
```


[6/2/2023 12:15 AM] Cat Bayes
**"27.5643 N, 152.7893 W..."** *Cat silently muttered...her eyes flashed for a moment as she accessed her __cyberdeck__, inputting the coordinates into the onboard GPS system.*

[6/2/2023 12:18 AM] Narration
A holographic map of all of the cybernet would display before her eyes. The coordinate was not within..Not even close. A small dot barely visible in the whole picture found __way__ out.


[6/2/2023 12:18 AM] Narration
One thing was for certain, It was not within even the scope of Vespera's reach. __The Unknown__


[6/2/2023 12:21 AM] Mathias
**"What are you doing?"** When did he enter? Well one thing is for certain, he was standing behind her.


[6/2/2023 12:24 AM] Cat Bayes
**"What...in the fuck?"** *These were not normal coordinates, hell, how did somebody even __get__ coordinates like thes-(*

**"FUCK!"** *So focused she was in her newfound discovery that she hadn't noticed Mathias standing behind her - hell, when did he even come in!* **"Ma-Mathias! U-Uh...I-I saw these old computers just sitting here and I wanted to check them out!"**


[6/2/2023 12:26 AM] Mathias
He looked down towards her for a solid 5 seconds before his eyes fluttered towards the screen. Reading the coordinates on the screen. **"That's District 1... Kilo. It's actual location."** He'd say before turning away from Cat. As if he intended to just leave on that note.


[6/2/2023 12:31 AM] Cat Bayes
**"I-I..."** *She hadn't had an actual conversation with the man yet, so her first impression of him was a broken, defeated elder who was way out of his prime...*

*But that, was anything but. Despite his large stature and her distracted focus earlier, she had __no idea__ he was there, whatsoever...and when she finally did notice him? He could've killed her effortlessly there. She had underestimated him severely.* **"W-Wait, Mathias!"**


[6/2/2023 12:32 AM] Mathias
He stopped in the doorway, his back still to Cat. He was listening.


[6/2/2023 12:37 AM] Cat Bayes
**"I- uh...I'm sorry for poking my nose around here, I know you don't trust me whatsoever, but-"** *But what, Cat? You don't know this man whatsoever, and that interaction just now proved that...so where to even start?*

**"...But Paige trusts you, so I do too...I uh...wanted to know more about you."** *She'd have to break the ice (not the cybernetic kind) at some point, and this was best a time than any other.* **"So...what's Mathias Wildbourne like?"**


[6/2/2023 12:51 AM] Mathias
He stayed silent for a moment, contemplating. He didn't move, his back still turned towards Cat, his hands resting slightly clenched by his sides. His next words came out as a low, weary sigh.

**"You're right. I don't trust easily... especially not after..."** He trailed off, not finishing the sentence, the weight of his past clearly a burden he still carried. He gave a bitter, half-hearted chuckle, **"What's Mathias Wildbourne like? I hardly know anymore."**

His voice echoed slightly in the bunker's confined space, **"But once upon a time, Mathias Wildbourne believed in a cause. He believed in a world that could be better, should be better and not fed lies of false prosperity. He was... a man who wasn't afraid to fight for that world."**

His shoulders hunched slightly, **"But that man saw his world, his people taken from him. So what does that leave? A shadow. A ghost. Only kept alive by the legacy he has left."** He was refering not only to himself but Paige.

Turning slightly, he glanced over his shoulder towards Cat. His eyes were like steel, hardened by battle and loss, but there was a flicker of something else in them - determination, perhaps, or resilience. A part of him that was still fighting for the cause to this day?

**"Now...now I do what I must. To wait and see if an opprotunity shows itself. Paige is... the future. She's what Horizon Grey was supposed to stand for. I still believe that the world can change. I'm just... more cautious now, more realistic about what it takes. That's all there is to know about Mathias Wildbourne."**

And with that, he moved away from the doorway, his figure disappearing into the dimly lit corridor beyond, leaving Cat with more questions than answers.


[6/2/2023 1:41 AM] Cat Bayes
**"...Ah-"** *It was hard to describe the feelings she had after hearing all of that from him...it was definitely a lot more than she was expecting to hear from him though, and part of her was...relieved by that? She wasn't sure if feeling that way was selfish or not, given the resolve he'd just dropped on her but...she wasn't looking forward to a dismissive scolding from him.*

*However, she was definitely left with more questions than answers...but not in the way one would expect. First of all, she had to revaluate her outlook on him...he wasn't broken, he was __battered__...not quite entirely beaten into submission, but someone who has been put through the most unbearable of hells imaginable, and yet still somehow moving forward, despite his pain and frustration...in a way, she was vaguely familiar with that experience herself, albeit not at his level.*

*Was it an insult, trying to compare herself to him? Maybe...she honestly didn't know, just as she didn't know how to sort out the mixed feelings that were racing through her mind. It would take time to sort through all of them and figure each of them out, but when she does, she'll talk to him once again...and mayhaps just get a straight answer out of him...what happened to Mathias Wildbourne back then?*


[6/3/2023 6:36 PM] Cat Bayes
*And speaking of questions...she turned her head back over towards the flickering computer screen, the coordinates still flashing on it's dusty surface...She mouthed the words spoken to her by Mathias: __District 1, Kilo__...what could that even mean? All her life she'd lived within District 9, and never really had questioned what was outside those walls...quite possibly due to her introverted personality , but as long as she steered clear from the world, then the world would never bother her...or so she thought.*

*After witnessing those twelve people die in front of her that night, and her vid shop - which was essentially her whole life - burn to the ground...she realized she could never avoid the world forever, and the more she tried to hide, the more it would come looking for her...and to make things worse, she had gotten complacent, leading it straight to her in the form of a monster. It might've been just vaguley, but she recognized that look in Mathias' eyes when he gave her his resolve...and it reminded her of pain.*


[6/3/2023 6:37 PM] Cat Bayes
**"..."** *Cat suddenly turned from the computer and ran out of the room, gripping the door frame and rounding the corner as she looked for Mathias.*


[6/3/2023 8:24 PM] Mathias
He was in the neighboring room, making himself a cup of coffee.


[6/3/2023 9:51 PM] Cat Bayes
**"Mathias I-...I wanna fight too, I wanna see the dream you and Paige and all the rest of Horizon Grey wanted to see."** *She took a deep breath.*

**"I thought for a long time...that I could ignore everything, just keep to myself and tend to my little shop...I was proven wrong, this *__city__* proved me wrong."**


[6/3/2023 9:56 PM] Cat Bayes
**"I know you said that Paige is the future of Horizon Grey, it's new legacy...but you're a part of that legacy too, a really big part..."** *She shuffled around and tilted her head towards the floor...she was really stepping out of her comfort zone with a little pep talk like this...soon enough, she raised her eyes back to Mathias.*

**"So, if you'll allow me...I want to be a part of that legacy too, I want to see what this society is hiding under the rug and expose it all."**


[6/3/2023 10:07 PM] Mathias
Pouring the coffee into a cup, his eyes carefully following the steady stream of black liquid. This elegant motion seemed almost at odds with his imposing figure, much like his ability to move unnoticed from one place to another. In response to Cat's request, he would consider her words before speaking.

**"The real question is, can you truly comprehend the depth of truth behind our work and the knowledge we possess? Not even including the battles you'll have to overcome? Countless times I've encountered individuals who claimed to understand, only to witness their gruesome demise, stripped of their cybernetic enhancements and discarded like waste or worst."**


[6/3/2023 10:07 PM] Mathias
**"Too many."**


[6/3/2023 10:20 PM] Mathias
He finished pouring his coffee. Setting the pot back into the pot heater before turning towards Cat. **"Despite this, Paige sees endless potential in you. That much I cannot ignore, recounted how you saved her ass from chromed out CCR special forces. She would've been dead without you."** Taking a sip of his coffee before looking down towards Cat once more. **"You'll need a lot more than netrunning if you're going to make the cut. Let me see the gun I gave you."**


[6/3/2023 10:27 PM] Cat Bayes
**"U-Uh...Yeah, yeah..."** *Reaching down into her pocket, she fumbled a bit before taking the gun by the barrel and pulling it out, walking over to Mathias as she handed it over to him.*


[6/3/2023 10:44 PM] Mathias
He would take it from her, inspecting it. **"You'll need to learn how to use this and other weapons. Luckily, you have the right mentor."**


[6/3/2023 10:51 PM] Cat Bayes
**"Y-Yeah, I think I can fig...wait, mentor? You mean..."**


[6/3/2023 11:35 PM] Mathias
He would then toss it in the air, catching it by the barrel and handing it back. **"Let me know whenever you want to get put on. I'll tell you now, that you're not going to be just shooting at paper targets like a gunk."**


[6/3/2023 11:48 PM] Mathias
**"Also.... There is something you need to know that Paige has not made you prevy too, and for good reason."**


[6/3/2023 11:49 PM] Cat Bayes
**"U-Uh, y-yeah! Thanks!"** *Once again, Cat didn't know how to feel about this offer from Mathias! It would definitely be an honor to learn under his tutelage!* 

**"Hm? What's that?"**


[6/3/2023 11:49 PM] Mathias
**"Best that we take a seat."** He would move towards the table across the room.


[6/3/2023 11:51 PM] Cat Bayes
**"Um...okay?"** *Cat moved over, grabbing a seat and sitting herself down.*


[6/3/2023 11:52 PM] Mathias
He would take his seat slowly. Setting the hot cup off towards the side. He'd clear his throat, **"Those coordinates you scrounged up. What did they tell you?"**


[6/3/2023 11:56 PM] Cat Bayes
**"Well...It was far beyond even the Cybernet, in unknown space...which according to you is...District 1?"** *Cat scratched her head.*

**"I tried to view it in the GPS, and it just...shot me out into the dark."**


[6/3/2023 11:58 PM] Mathias
**"It's because you reside in a __sub-net.__ "**


[6/3/2023 11:59 PM] Cat Bayes
*She had to blink at that, was he telling her that the cybernet, the one she's been dealing in her __entire life__...was a part of a larger whole?*


[6/4/2023 12:01 AM] Mathias
**"The cybernet you believe you traverse through is fabricated. Sectioned off, isolated from the bigger picture. That coordinate you've found, is thousands of miles away."**


[6/4/2023 12:02 AM] Mathias
**"The 'Districts' aren't connected. Vespera doesn't exist. It is __not__ a city. It's a faction."**


[6/4/2023 12:02 AM] Cat Bayes
*Holy shit, holy FUCKING shit...Mathias was right, if she was standing right now she'd have fallen over. **"...W-Wait...Hold on..."**


[6/4/2023 12:05 AM] Cat Bayes
**"I..."** *Her eyes were widened, thoughts racing at a million miles an hour just from processing his words.* **"I mean...the cybernet had to come from somewhere- wait then who made it? What's out there in District 1? What even are the districts?"**

*Cat suddenly put her hand on the table to brace herself.* **"Woah...nante kotoda choomba..."**


[6/4/2023 12:08 AM] Mathias
**"Yes, it had to be born from someone, or some entity. Our best netrunner—"** His voice softned, **"Felicity, she could have told you."**


[6/4/2023 12:10 AM] Mathias
**"Each district is city or community. All tethered under Vespera's rule."**


[6/4/2023 12:11 AM] Cat Bayes
**"Felicity...is...was she the one who's computer I was messing around with?"**


[6/4/2023 12:13 AM] Mathias
**"Yes, a memento."**


[6/4/2023 12:23 AM] Cat Bayes
**"...Yeah...I would've totally wanted to meet her."** *She reminisiced with a quiet chuckle, taking a deep inhale as she continued to process his words.*

**"Okay...so, District 9's Cybernet is actually a subnet, and from what I can gather, every other district has it's own subnet, which implies the existence of a domain net...as for hierarchy, District 9 appears to be on top of all the other districts...it would be possible to locate this main net, but I'd need to access the servers where this city's...or faction's subnet resides, assuming that each of the networks even communicate with each other- Holy shit this is so fucking wild."** *With this newfound information...somewhat digested, Cat began to ramble about different theories!*

**"I mean- can you imagine what kind of information could be on this main Cybernet? Every single possible secret this city - and all of the other cities have to offer could be there! An-And what about the Old Net, it could be the key to __finally__ exploring that barren wasteland of malevolent daemons and viruses...but then, if that's the case, why hasn't anyone tried it yet? And for that matter, who even knows about this main net? M-Mathias, this is amazing!"**


[6/4/2023 12:37 AM] Mathias
**"Save the enthusiasm, kid. There are bigger problems than solving the net."** He would sigh, just as much energy if not more than what Paige has to offer.


[6/4/2023 12:40 AM] Cat Bayes
**"A-Ah, right, sorry."** *Slow your roll there Cat! Sitting back down, she cleared her throat and waited for him to continue.*


[6/4/2023 12:44 AM] Mathias
**"The districts we talk about are spread across the globe. Vast distances between them, what lies between them are remnants of the old world. Occupied by monsters, the untouched, and all sorts of fucking crazy shit."**


[6/4/2023 12:45 AM] Mathias
**"A never-ending warzone that stretch's beyond boundaries."**


[6/4/2023 12:49 AM] Cat Bayes
**"If...If that's the case, then what's the CCR's whole role in all of this? They can't be overseeing *every* district if it's that globe spanning, can they?"**


[6/4/2023 12:52 AM] Mathias
**"The CCR are nothing but enforcers a branch to the tree. They enforce what Vespera wants. Ruthless in how they do it. But, it works. Keeps you and everyone else in line. Question nothing, accept their reality."**


[6/4/2023 12:55 AM] Cat Bayes
**"...So how...have you learned about all this? How do you know about the districts...and the subnets?"**


[6/4/2023 12:56 AM] Mathias
**"Do you __really__ want to know the answer to that?"**


[6/4/2023 12:57 AM] Cat Bayes
*Yeah...that definitely was a loaded question...but to Cat, the answer seemed obvious.* **"...My old life was burnt to the ground, and with it twelve other people whose names I don't even know...I can't turn away from this. Yes, I want to know."**


[6/4/2023 1:12 AM] Mathias
Mathias' gaze hardened and he nodded slowly. The room was filled with a tense silence for a moment, his mind treading over some memories.

**"I was a member of the CCR Special Forces, in my younger days. Rank didn't mean much to me then. I saw it as a duty, a way to keep the peace. Most of the guys who made it to special forces either had the same mentality or just had wild variants along the lines of...self-projection."** he started, his voice hushed yet steady. He gazed at the cup on the table as if he were looking back in time.

**"We worked with the VIDF, the Vespera Intercontential Defense Forces. A literal army unlike the CCR. It wasn't just a simple policing, it was more... We were supposed to protect the citizens of each district from external threats. But the reality..."** He paused, struggling to get the words out.

**"The reality was different. The people we targeted weren't always the 'bad guys'. Sometimes they were innocent, weak, undefended. And we... we hurt them. Terrorized them, even,"** Mathias's voice wavered slightly, the grim realization evident in his tone.

He looked back at Cat, his expression serious. **"We were an army constantly combating forces outside the walls of each city. The very walls that were meant to protect the innocent were somtiems the very barriers that kept them entrapped. Facing the same hardships as those who had nothing to do with Vespera."**

Mathias sighed, the weight of his past action bearing heavily on him. He then straightend up, looking at Cat intently. **"That's how I know about the districts... and the subnets. I was a part of the system that enforces Vespera's will."**

His voice grew steely. **"And that's why I turned my back on Vespera and founded Horizon Grey. To strike back against the real bad guys."**


[6/4/2023 1:23 AM] Mathias
**"I couldn't stomach what we were doing. The justifications, the excuses, they all began to ring hollow. That's when I decided to found Horizon Grey. To fight back, to defend the defenseless, to stand against the unchecked power of Vespera and the CCR,"** 

Mathias continued, **"Horizon Grey started as a rogue unit, consisting of me and a few trusted chooms who were disillusioned with the actions of the VIDF. We defected, deserting our positions in the SF and breaking away from the oppressive rule of Vespera. Of course the act of rebellion never goes well. All previous attempts, the repercussions were severe. But for us it was a necessary risk to take. What seperated us from prior rebellions were our experince."**

**"We went off-grid, moved outside the city walls where Vespera's control was weaker. It was hard at first, fending for ourselves, constantly on the move to avoid detection. But it also gave us a change to operate freely, to organize, and begin pushing back."**

**"Years go by and Horizon Grey expanded rapidly. Everyone disillusioned with the status quo started joining us. Built a network of operatives known as Greys. Many found refuge with Horizon while others saw us as a means to reach a common goal — dismantle the oppressive systems Vespera has put in place."**

**"We were not the same as the CCR or VIDF. We did not aimm to control or manipulate. We just wanted to give people their freedom back, to expose the lies and provide a path out of the darkness. "**


[6/4/2023 1:26 AM] Mathias
**"Time goes by and well, years of fighting with the VIDF and CCR proved to give our advisories plenty of leverage to find our weakness. It was a slaughter, every man and woman for themselves. There are other members of Grey who are out there... But they assumed lives that would grant them survival. Severing ties since we are 'dead'."**

[6/5/2023 12:33 AM] Cat Bayes
*Cat was quiet while she was being regaled with this...rather jaw dropping story about the literal origins of Horizon Grey...hell, even way before their origins. Mathias fucking Wildbourne was CCR once upon a time? Not only that, but he was in their Special Forces division - which not only checked out with his physical abilities and legends - but also explained how he knew everything about...well, everything. The Subnet, and the domain net behind the curtain? The Districts? The truth behind the CCR and the corrupt corpo bastards who run Vespera? He's seen it all, because he __was__ it all at one point.*

*Leaning forward as she rested her elbows onto her knees, she placed both of her hands in front of her nose and inhaled sharply...even after everything she's been told tonight, this was the hardest one to process...because it made way too much sense for her. It's like that one theory in the back of your mind that you don't know how to put your finger on until somebody tells you exactly what it is.* **"It...everything makes sense now...oh my god, Mathias..."**


[6/5/2023 12:35 AM] Mathias
**"It was a wise decision to have you take a sit."** He would take a hold of his coffee cup once more. Taking a longer drink. It has cooled down enough!


[6/5/2023 12:35 AM] Paige
She would drop down from the hatch, turning towards the two as she strode in their direction. Her interest piqued. **"Oh? I did not expect you both to be sitting down and chatting."**

*Puffing her cheeks out, she let out a tired exhale as she tried to look at Mathias' expression, what could he possibly be thinking right now?...Ah, but Paige just came back from her date, best to let Mathias tell her these things instead of her spoiling all his secrets...which ironically enough, was her whole job.*

**"Oh yeah, y'know, we're just talking about girl things...uuhhh, manicures and pretty dresses, the good stuff."** *She said, her frown turning to an amused smile as she chuckled, giving the man in front of her a playful punch on the knee.* **"Ain't that right Mathias?"**


[6/5/2023 12:55 AM] Mathias
**"Ha."** That is all he will give Cat.


[6/5/2023 12:55 AM] Paige
**"Uhuh, girl things?"** She placed her hands on her hips. **"Mathias doesn't strike me as the type to partake in such...things."** Her eyebrow quirked. **"Unless."**


[6/5/2023 12:55 AM] Mathias
**"Nope."** He would get up, leaving the room before Paige could continue.


[6/5/2023 12:55 AM] Paige
**"Oh, come on, Mathias."**


[6/5/2023 12:57 AM] Cat Bayes
**"Oh no really, he's all into it...in fact, he was also telling me how he'd foot the bill for those thirty pizzas we were talking about earlier!"** *Welp, time to throw the coin in the wishing well, Cat gave Mathias a __very__ expectant stare with a rather hungry smile as she said that!*


[6/5/2023 12:58 AM] Mathias
**"Not happening."** He would say as he passed the door threshold, his voice muffled.


[6/5/2023 1:02 AM] Cat Bayes
**"Aww, worth a shot..."** *Leaning back with a smile, she watched as he walked past the door...despite whoever he was in the past, all that mattered was who he was now...a man who was damaged by his past, now trying to pick up the pieces while he walks to a better future...fuck, she aughta save that for a fan-fic later on.*

*Turning back to Paige, she leaned the side of her head into her fist.* **"So! First date, how'd it go? I want *all* the juicy details girl!"**


[6/5/2023 1:12 AM] Paige
**"He was totally all over me."** She would start, **"Went as well as I expected it to be honest. Starting returning to our former glory. Of course, when Mathias started off he had big guns right off the bat."**


[6/5/2023 8:54 PM] Cat Bayes
**"Hard to match the legends of history, yeah?"** *She turned, still keeping her head turned towards Paige as she rests her elbow on the table.*

**"But now you've got some growing legends around now, won't be long till I join you guys out in the field!"** *Winking at her friend with a teasing grin.*


[6/5/2023 8:54 PM] Cat Bayes
**"So, when's the big guy coming over here?"**


[6/6/2023 9:21 PM] Paige
**"Don't know yet. Still need to break the news to Mathias about him."** She would slowly pace back and fourth. **"Money is going to be a constant problem."** Paige would take care of Mathias's coffee cup. **"Doing favors for others is going to be our biggest revenue maker. With that said I would assume that you'll continue working gigs for Digit. Always needing someone to net run."**


[6/6/2023 9:22 PM] Paige
She would pour out the rest of the coffee. **"The more we work with Digit, the more fixers we will be open to. We'll do this until we can start pursuing our own interests in full."**


[6/10/2023 2:56 PM] Cat Bayes
**"Like going after that corporate ass who burned my shop to the ground..."** *It might not've seemed like it, but Cat was always thinking about that night, in the back of her mind.*

**"Mmh...Speaking of which, do you happen to have any idea when we'll be getting our next job?"**


[9/21/2024 10:05 PM] Paige
Paige would tap her fingers along the edge of the table. **"Heard from D a hour ago that Nico was drumming up another gig for Kapea. For me, I have will have to wait for gigs to come up near Metro. If I glitch in Littleton or Kapea, you can kiss my ass goodbye. It's a matter of time before Nico buzzes you. Hope you don't mind that I gave him your digits?"**


[9/21/2024 10:16 PM] Cat Bayes
*Shifting her palm into the side of her cheek, a hint of intrigue sparked in the netrunner's eyes.* **"Oh yeah, I don't mind."** *She responded casually. After all, how would she get any more gigs if she didn't have her fixer's number?* **"So, It's more solo jobs for me then? No running with the legendary Paige from Horizon Grey just yet?"** *She asked with a slightly teasing undertone in her voice.*


[9/21/2024 10:41 PM] Paige
**"I know, I know!"** She held her hands up defensively, playing along with the tease. **"I really screwed up and I got to live with the consequences. On the bright side, this is perfect for you to really standout from the other net runners in the district. It's fierce competition."** 

She stood up and walked over towards the old computer sitting in the corner of the room. A duffle bag rested on the table, which she began rummaging through. **"I'm not going to sit around and do nothing either. Doing some investigations of my own. Like how they managed to get a beat on me and what not."**


[9/21/2024 10:57 PM] Cat Bayes
**"About that."** *Leaning forward, Cat's expression doured into something a bit more serious.* **"When I was trying to get you off the bounty hunter's mainframe, I saw *a lot* of dirt on you, and I mean *a lot.*"** *She emphasized those words with her hands, spreading them wide for Paige to give her a visual reference.*

**"They even had a tracker installed on your car dude. At that point, I'm surprised they didn't have your social security information."** *Placing her hands back down at the table, she gave her friend a rather worried look.* **"What I'm trying to figure out is how the hell they got so much crap on you, it's like they've been meaning to target ya for a while now."**


[9/21/2024 11:00 PM] Paige
She retrieved the rifle she acquired during the incident. Her mind occupied on Cat's revelations. **"...Could be a snitch."** She stated, looking back towards Cat. **"It would certainly have to be someone who has been close to me. Someone I've been dealing with recently too."**


[9/21/2024 11:01 PM] Paige
With an exasperation, she began dismantling the rifle. __WHO__ could it be? **"I don't think it was Kode since he tipped me off about the bounty on my head."**


[9/21/2024 11:05 PM] Cat Bayes
*Thinking about it for a moment, Cat tapped her finger on the table before looking back up to her friend.* **"What about our new boyfriend? He's definitely not the snitch, but he could know who it is - or at least have some idea anyways."**

*Oh right, speaking of which.* **"Oooh...Yeah, so since we're on the topic of your dirty laundry, have you ever done any mass genocide by any chance?"**

[9/21/2024 11:24 PM] Paige
Paige hadn't expected such a serious inquiry to come at her. Confusion was written on her face, as her eyebrows knit together as she attempted to formulate a sense of comprehension. As seconds passed, she realized the gravity of the question. Did Cat find something that warranted such a question? 

Her head then turned towards Cat, her brow furrowing even more. **"Genocide?"** She repeated incredulously. **"What are you talking about?"**

 **"Look."** *Cat stated before she elaborated any further.* **"You're my bestest friend, and probably the only person I trust as much as I do. If you actually *did* have to kill a bunch of people, it was probably for survival or some shit."**

*Scratching the side of her head, she looked off to a corner of the room before she continued.* **"That, or...the CCR is making up some shit to make you look bad, I dunno...but whatever the case is, I'd really appreciate it if you were honest with me here."**


[9/21/2024 11:43 PM] Paige
**"Cat..."** This was not the time to talk about __anything__ remote to that. **"I don't...Fuck."** She'd roll her eyes, pushing the dismantled rifle towards the center of the table. **"Listen, can we talk about any 'crimes' you have found later?"**


[9/21/2024 11:48 PM] Cat Bayes
**"Paige..."** *Cat looked like she wanted to push the subject, but hearing the conflict in her voice was enough to keep her at bay for the time being. Breaking down with a deep sigh, she shook her head before turning her gaze away.* **"Alright, I understand. You've been through enough shit as it is, and I'm not gonna judge you if you had to get your hands dirty in the past."**

*Her eyes trailed back over to her friend, gauging her reaction.* **"I just don't want it to hurt our friendship later, I really like you Pags."**


[9/22/2024 12:00 AM] Paige
With a deep inhale and short exhale, Paige returned to the rifle. **"It isn't enough for me to damage my opinions on you. All will be revealed with due time. Once I can ensure that __we__ are safe from the CCR we can revisit this, ok?"**


[9/22/2024 12:03 AM] Cat Bayes
**"R-Right, sorry Pags."** *Cat apologized, feeling like an idiot. She didn't mean to come off as distrustful towards her friend, but that little mass genocide tidbit in her list of crimes had been in the back of her mind ever since she found it. There's no way it could be true, and even if it was, Paige was sure to have her reasons...right?* **"So uh...no hard feelings, then?"**


[9/22/2024 12:17 AM] Paige
**"No hard feelings."** She grinned despite the atmosphere.


[9/22/2024 12:17 AM] Narration
Just then, Cat was receiving a call from Nico. Talk about bailing a sister out.


[9/22/2024 12:20 AM] Cat Bayes
*Phew! Talk about getting her out of an awkward situation! Focusing on the notification appearing in her optical feed, she looked over at Paige and gave her a nod.* **"It's Nico, gimme a sec."**

*Suddenly, her pupils flashed a digital orange hue, the telltale sign that she was in a call.* 
```fix
"Yo, Nico. What's the stitch?"
```


[9/22/2024 12:31 AM] Nico
> **"Hey, devushka. Got a gig that came across my retinas last night. Wondering if you're up to bugging some choom's remote server in Kapea."**


[9/22/2024 12:34 AM] Cat Bayes
```fix
"Funny, I was just thinking about how badly I wanted to do exactly that today. You sure you're not psychic or something choomba?~"
```
*A slight smirk curled up on Cat's face, clearly amused by her little tease.*
```fix
"When do you need me in?"
```


[9/22/2024 12:37 AM] Nico
> **"Preferably soon, Digit is missing some goods and wants to know why they aren't being delivered. I would handle it myself, but I'm tied up with some next level ice from some corpo."**


[9/22/2024 12:40 AM] Cat Bayes
```fix
"Alright, I'll delta on over ASAP then. See you in a bit."
```
*Her eyes flickering back to their normal state, Cat looked back over to Paige with a slight grin.* **"Well, gig landed. Gonna bug some shill or something in Kapea."**


[9/22/2024 12:42 AM] Paige
**"Good luck out there, sis."** She would state, briefly looking up from her work. **"If anything new develops on my end, you'll be first to know."**


[9/22/2024 12:50 AM] Cat Bayes
*As she walked past her pinked haired partner in crime, she gave her a cute bump on the shoulder with her fist.* **"I'm gonna hold you to that, sis! Don't go doing anything I wouldn't do, kay?"**


[9/22/2024 12:53 AM] Paige
**"I'll try my best!"** Paige remarked. However, when Cat left the room. **"...."** The smile dropped slightly... Then it was completely replaced with a frown.


[9/22/2024 12:59 AM] Paige
**"Damn it."** She'd mutter.


[9/22/2024 12:59 AM] Mathias
**"It was __you__ who brought that netrunner."** Mathias with his ungodly timed entrances. He was leaning in the doorway opposite to where Paige was facing, but not looking at her. **"It would only be a matter of time before she would've found out. Already cracked into Felicity favorite terminal."**


[9/22/2024 1:04 AM] Paige
**"I know, it wasn't on this screen the last time I messed with it."** She stated, glancing over towards the terminal. She was sharp in noticing the small detail. She then stood up straight and turned towards Mathias. **"I know she said she wouldn't judge me for...the past. But, I can't bring myself to trust her words."**


[9/22/2024 1:08 AM] Mathias
**"You are always quick to reprimand others when you think something is inherently wrong. Yet your closest is twice as large as mine. You'll figure it out."** He snorted before pushing off the door frame and vanishing back into the other room.


[9/23/2024 12:07 AM] Paige
**"You're not helping. Asshole..."**

[12/9/2024 12:44 PM] Narration
It was the dead of night by the time that Cat returned to The hideout. The CCR patrols along the way have really ramped up in recent days which is a crazy thing to think about in Haven heights.

So many checkpoints so many shakedowns raida on buildings that only one could wonder if the horizon hideout was going to be the next one of these days.

Once Cat ensured that the coast was clear she made her way towards the entry. However as she reached the bottom step a van could be heard reviving its engine flying down the road...


[12/9/2024 12:47 PM] Cat Bayes
**"Hm?"** *Well, that could only be one of two things, bad trouble or good trouble. Before she could make her way into the base, she made sure to keep a firm grip on the handle of her revolver as she peeked over to see who that was.*


[12/9/2024 12:50 PM] Narration
It was a van for certain. The stencil design on the side gave it away that it was one of fleet vehicles for his business front. Then as it neared, it came to a stop just down the road an outcome page as she wearily looked about before moving to the back of the van.


[12/9/2024 12:53 PM] Paige
She opened the doors to the back and began pulling out a motionless body.


[12/9/2024 12:56 PM] Cat Bayes
*Oh, the good kind of trou- Was that a dead body?*

**"...Ah shit."** *Holstering the revolver, she quickly made her way over to help Paige drag the corpse into the base.*

*...Wait a second.* **"Is that boyfriend?"** *She whispered urgently, moving over to take hold of his legs.* **"Did you kill boyfriend?!"** *More whispering!*


[12/9/2024 1:02 PM] Paige
**"Why are you calling him that?!"** She whispered back.
**"No, I didn't __kill__ him."** She clarified. **"He got into it with the CCR. he's just unconscious. Help me get him inside."**


[12/9/2024 1:08 PM] Cat Bayes
**"Fucks sake!"** *She hissed, hoisting his ankles while Paige took the arms.* **"Eugh, is that *his* blood? Jesus christ, he's covered in it!"**


[12/9/2024 1:27 PM] soulrifthunter
:waahh:


[12/9/2024 2:08 PM] Paige
**"Unfortunately, two more of these and you'll get used to it."**


[12/9/2024 2:08 PM] Narration
Briskly, the two carried the unconscious Cole into the hideout. Once inside, they allocated a room for him.


[12/9/2024 2:08 PM] Paige
She closed the door to the room now assigned to Cole. With an exasperated sigh, she turned back to Cat and slightly smiled.
**"Thanks, if I was the only one carrying him, I'd drop him and short circuit his board."**


[12/9/2024 2:13 PM] Cat Bayes
**"Yeah, what are friends for?"** *She teased, her eyes grossly staring at the blood on her palms.* **"Eueck, lemme go wash my hands real quick then I'll take a look at his software..."**


[12/9/2024 2:36 PM] Paige
**"It would be best if I stay nearby when you do that... I can't be certain how he'll react to seeing a foreign face being the first thing he noticed if he comes to."**


[12/9/2024 3:20 PM] Cat Bayes
**"Fair enough!"** *Cat called out from the bathroom, the sound of sinkwater running echoing down the hall.* **"He won't...actually try to choke me when he wakes up, will he?"**


[12/9/2024 4:31 PM] Paige
**"I wish I knew the probability."** She replied, leaning against the wall.


[12/9/2024 4:35 PM] Cat Bayes
*Well, that filled her with all sorts of confidence. The squeaking of the tap being turned and the water cutting off could be heard from the other room, and Cat came back with a dry rag wrapped around her hands.*

**"Well, hope and pray I guess..."** *She mumbled under her breath, sitting beside the bed he was laying at.*


[12/9/2024 4:46 PM] Cat Bayes
*Tapping the side of her temple, her eyes flashed orange as her cyberdeck booted up.* **"Time to see what we're working with here..."**

[12/9/2024 4:49 PM] Cat Bayes
*She carefully traces her gaze across the bounty hunter's body, screens of information appearing within her digital space that brought up all sorts of hardware specs and software information. Getting past his ICE was easy enough, given that he was in front of her and unconscious.*

*What kind of damage was she seeing?*

**"Well..."** *She breathed out, her fingers tapping against what looked like thin air.* **"He's not in any critical danger right now, but that's not gonna last long if we don't find him some blood and a medical professional."**


[12/9/2024 8:19 PM] Cat Bayes
**"I can reboot some of his software to stay on the safe side, and maybe try to repair some surface damage, but..."**


[12/9/2024 8:24 PM] Paige
**"I've given him an IV to keep his fluids in check."** Paige detailed. **"Medical professional is not a card I would be considering  who we are, and finding blood off the streets is not something I am very confident in administering. I've seen people lose more blood and still be fine in the long-run... Most of the time."**


[12/9/2024 8:29 PM] Paige
She'd snap her finger, **"Kode might be able to help us."**


[12/9/2024 8:32 PM] Paige
Without missing a beat, Paige went to call him. The corner of her right eye illuminating yellow for a brief moment before flashing red. Her eyes widened and her brows furrowed incredulously... Everyone knew what such a sequence meant... Destination Unreachable.


[12/9/2024 8:40 PM] Paige
There are myriad of reason this is could be. Most of them weren't good. Now was not the time for that... Squeezing her eyes shut for a moment and shaking her head, she reopened her eyes with a steady breath. **"He's not available... So, we are on our own for now. I hate to ask Digit for more favors; I still have to return his wheels."**


[12/9/2024 8:52 PM] Cat Bayes
*Cat was busy patching up any software that might've been damaged in his tussle with the CCR, but hearing that from Paige was a bit...concerning.* **"Kode...that guy was one of your old pals, right? The ripperdoc?"** *Shit, if something happened to him, then...*

*No, don't think about that right now Cat, focus on the task at hand. Looking back towards the boyfriend, she continued to work away on his cybernetics.* **"Well, don't worry bout Digit, I think I managed to make a good enough impression to sweet talk him into helping us."**


[12/9/2024 9:00 PM] Paige
**"Let's wait until the morning... I'll check on him every once in and while."** She opened the door and stepped out of the room.


[12/9/2024 9:10 PM] Cat Bayes
*Cat watched as her friend left the room, arm draped over the back of the chair. She didn't enjoy seeing her look like this, but there was also that whole 'genocide' thing she discovered...*

*She turned to look at the sleeping bounty hunter, huffing a deep sigh as she took in the silence left in Paige's absence.* **"Y'know boyfriend, the whole situation is fucked..."**


[12/9/2024 9:16 PM] Cat Bayes
**"I'm gonna keep supporting Paige, for sure...but I'd really like to know what happened back then."** *She conversed with the man as if he were actually awake to respond.* **"And it'd suck if you died on our watch too, so uh...don't do that."**


[12/9/2024 9:21 PM] Cat Bayes
**"..."** *Not much of a conversationalist, was he?* **"Soooo, do anything for fun? Anyone you got a crush on?"**

*...Nope, nothing.*


[12/9/2024 9:27 PM] Cat Bayes
**"Welp, since you're not gonna say anything-"** *It wouldn't do them any good if he got fucked up again and they didn't know where he was at, nor would it help if he suddenly felt a little less charitable and decided to rat them out. Swiping her fingers to the side, she nonchalantly typed up a few lines of code and started installing it deep within his software.*

*It wasn't anything dangerous really, just a harmless little tracker so she'd be able to keep eyes on him. Was that creepy? Sure, but in this city, you can't be too safe.*


[12/9/2024 10:09 PM] Cat Bayes
**"Welp, good talk boyfriend!"** *Pat pat! The netrunner gently pat him a couple times on the shoulder, before she stood up and walked out of the room. Maybe now was the best time to talk to Paige, speaking of which, where was she?*


[12/9/2024 10:12 PM] Paige
She was in the sitting room, wiping her hands with a towel. Her gaze was distant, staring beyond the concrete walls that enveloped the hideout's basement. **". . ."**


[12/9/2024 10:14 PM] Cat Bayes
*...Well, Mathias was nowhere to be found, and Paige seemed to have plenty on her mind as it was. Maybe it wasn't the best time to bring up what she found just yet.* 

**"Ahem."** *She lightly coughed, trying to get her attention.*


[12/9/2024 10:20 PM] Paige
Upon hearing the abrupt change in the ambient, she literally jumped a little more than usual. Looking over her shoulder, she finished drying her hands and tossed the towel on the faucet. **"Oh, sorry. Lost in thought again... We were suppose to talk about your findings?"**


[12/9/2024 10:21 PM] Cat Bayes
**"That...can wait for a bit."** *Cat walked into the room with her fingers interlocked behind her back, she seemed pretty concerned about her friend.* **"How are you doing, sis? Everything okay?"**


[12/9/2024 10:25 PM] Paige
**"..."** She looked down with her gaze, a deep frown etched across her face. **"I am not too sure I am ready to answer that truthfully."** With a roll of her head, Paige walked towards the table and pulled a chair out so that she could seat herself. **"So much has happened, past and present that I am sometimes finding hard to process it all."**


[12/9/2024 10:26 PM] Paige
**"Am I even doing the right thing?"** She asked absent-mindedly. Not expecting a true answer, if any.


[12/9/2024 10:37 PM] Cat Bayes
*...She didn't know a lot about Paige, that's something she just realized. For someone who she called sister, she figured she'd be able to confide in her, and have her do the same when the time came. Well, the time came alright, and here she was...woefully unprepared.*

*Cat followed her solemn friend to the table and pulled out the chair adjacent to hers. She sat there, staring for a moment or two in silence...and a few moments more, for good measure. It wasn't until she'd finally put together all her thoughts that she let out a sigh, and spoke.*


[12/9/2024 10:42 PM] Cat Bayes
**"You know...I wouldn't be here if it wasn't for you,"** *She started, moving her hand over Paige's to comfort her.* **"Even before this whole shitshow started, before my store was burnt down, it was always you who was there for me."**

**"I ran from my shitty family a long time ago, I didn't have anyone who I could rely on or even trust."** *A slight smile tugged at her lips as she recalled those nostalgic days, showing her friend all those stupid raunchy clips whenever she came into the store.* **"It was you, Pags, always you."**


[12/9/2024 10:45 PM] Cat Bayes
**"Things happened back then, fucked up things that you may or may not have had any control over."** *She was referring to her elusive past, and whatever transpired that led to the previous downfall of Horizon Grey.* **"Well, I don't think a bad person would take me in when I was alone, or saved 'Boyfriend' back there after he tried to attack you."**


[12/9/2024 10:46 PM] Cat Bayes
**"Sometimes...Sometimes this city just doesn't allow for 'the right thing,' you just gotta do what you can and roll with it."**


[12/9/2024 10:59 PM] Paige
It might have been all Cat needed to see when Paige looked up to her and gave a weak smile. In order to prevent any tears from being shed, she quickly swiped away at her eyes with her free hand.  **"I'm sorry,"** Paige apologized. **"There was a lot going on back then. There's a lot of action on now."**

In spite of how much she resented having to remember, Paige did. The presence of her best friend only heightened her shame. As she glanced at the ceiling, she laughed. Having a hard time coping with something...

**"Mathias even laid into me about my fucking secrets..."** Bringing both of her hands to her face, she pulled downwards, stretching her face to its limits. She lowered her head in exasperation, gazing at the table. **"The truth is, I have killed a lot of people. A...lot of people..."**


[12/9/2024 11:05 PM] Paige
**"...."** It was as if her body was shutting down. The words would never escape her mouth, no matter how hard she tried. Paige felt as though she was caught in a relentless storm, with guilt and remorse crashing over her like unforgiving waves. Each name and face haunted her conscience, a constant reminder of the irreversible choices she had made. She wrestled with the suffocating weight of her past actions, yearning for redemption yet fearing it was unattainable. 

She winced in pain. After that she grimaced, gritting her teeth and squinting her eyes in anticipation of the tears. Paige's hands trembled as they rested on the table, fingers twitching to maintain control. Her breathing became shallow and rapid, each inhale a struggle against chest tightness. She felt a burning sensation in her throat, suppressing the sobs that threatened to break free but failed. Paige's face scrunched up and tears streamed down her cheeks. She immediately put her head down onto the table and began to sob. Her body shook with the force of her sobs, her breathing ragged and her heart pounding in her chest. She was lost in her own world of pain and sorrow, feeling completely and utterly alone with the pain despite her support being right there.


[12/9/2024 11:19 PM] Cat Bayes
**"..."** *In the midst of her tears, she felt Cat's hand slip away from hers. So that's how she truly felt, huh? Was the truth so bad that not even she could-*

*Warmth, a familiar warmth gently wrapped itself around the sobbing girl. It was Cat, her eyes closed and her arms pulling her friend into her comforting embrace. Her hand slowly rubbed up and her back, occasionally giving her a pat or two.* **"It's alright, you don't have to tell me the whole thing right away...I'm just glad you told me that."**

**"Just let it out, don't stop...keep going until all that doubt and fear and stress is gone."**

[12/9/2024 11:33 PM] Paige
It took Paige a while to finally stop crying, but eventually she did, her head resting on her best friend's shoulder all the while until she was entirely done. When she finished, Paige sat back up and rubbed at her face. **"Thank you,"** she said in a weak voice, **"that was...long overdue."**

**"I... We...No.. Those people were innocent. Through and through, innocent to a fault. Had I know that they were the target, I would have never went to that facility... I would have warned them. I would have done anything to protect them. But I could do nothing."**


[12/9/2024 11:43 PM] Paige
She ripped off her choker, horizontally across her entire neck appeared to be a cybernetic of some sort. It pulsed with a faint blue hue. Her eyes never meeting Cat's. **"I'm a key... Vespera have ballistic missile facilities dotting around 'The Haze'. Each facility has a target. Hard coded targets and they don't change. They never change..."**

**"Brillion.. A faction mirroring Vespera killed my best friend and a lot of good people prior to this...incident. A lot of us wanted revenge and all the facilities that we knew of targeted Brillion facilities. How we found out that I was the key is when we went to one of these facilities and the moment I interacted with a terminal, they went off."**

**"... Done this a few times so I thought nothing of it. Seize the facility, interact with the terminals, launch the missiles... Get our revenge and... all is well...."**

There was a long pause, her eyes peering millions of miles away. 

**"District 11.... It's a wasteland now."** She looked to the side, feeling sick just replaying the situation in her head.


[12/9/2024 11:54 PM] Cat Bayes
**"Oh god...Paige..."** *She whispered faintly, trying her best to process this information. Still - she hadn't let go - she was still holding onto her friend, and now that she's heard the whole story...it was like a wave of relief had washed over her. Now she had to do the same for her friend.*

**"There's...no way you could've known, not in that moment."** *She shook her head, remembering the anger she felt when that shitbag burned down her store and killed those innocent people...people __she__ got killed.* **"Paige, you're not a monster, you...are another victim of circumstance, of this fucking city..."**


[12/10/2024 12:01 AM] Paige
**"This city is just a mere speck. It's hard to comprehend until you see the bigger picture, Cat... Everyone that once loved me now hates me and they would be thankful to see me dead because I am a __threat__. I..honestly feel that Horizon Grey wasn't undone by Vespera, but our own... The same family I swore to weld together and keep alive, turned on me and what we strove for and... and the only people who truly understood that Mathias and Kode... I don't even think Kode is alive, because of me..."**


[12/10/2024 9:19 AM] Cat Bayes
**”Well, I can tell you that you’re wrong about one, maybe two or three things.”** *Cat said with an endearing smile, pulling away from her friend so that she could look her in the eyes.* **”You’ve still got your little sis in your corner, and she loves ya to death.”** 

*She pointed at herself with her thumb, giving her friend a playful wink.* **”And to prove that, I’m gonna help you find Kode, cause I bet’cha a million credits that guy’s still kicking.”**

[12/11/2024 7:54 PM] Cole Mercer
*Cole Mercer—that was his name. He found himself lying on an unfamiliar bed, his upper body bare and his lower half clothed. __**His mask was gone,**__ and he couldn't feel his handguns nearby. His chest bore multiple scars, none of them recent, and his left arm was completely bandaged. The bed wasn't large enough to accommodate his entire frame, but it was better than anything he’d had in a while.*
# WHERE AM I?
*That was his first thought. He didn't sit up; instead, he moved his eyes left and right, absorbing as many details as he could. Making noise was out of the question—not until he had a good grasp of his surroundings. Even while asleep and vulnerable, he remained methodical. What did his eyes manage to catch?*

[12/11/2024 8:11 PM] Narration
His mask was resting at the side of the bed. The rest of the clothing articles were beneath the mask, folded. Once his deck registered he was awake, he was prompted with a message, the sender: Paige Underwood.


[12/11/2024 8:15 PM] Cole Mercer
*He noticed his equipment nearby. To think this is what would happen as soon as he lost consciousness. Cole hadn't expected to come this far—he had genuinely believed his end would come in that warehouse.*
-# "A message? From Paige?" **he thought.** 
*Let's hear it then.*


[12/11/2024 8:36 PM] Paige
`I bailed you out in Kapea. If you awake while I am gone, then thats a good thing. Means I won't have to shell money for a doc. You're safe at our temporary hide-out. A friend of mine will be looking after you, try to play nice? I won't be out long.`  This was the message.


[12/11/2024 8:46 PM] Cole Mercer
*A friend of hers would be looking after him. It meant nothing to him. He had fought through Kapea alone, driven by sheer adrenaline until it ran dry and he blacked out.*

*Cole methodically sat up, shifting his legs so his feet touched the cold ground. He put on his shoes and the rest of his garments, __but left the mask for now.__ The bandages were a clear sign—proceed with caution.*

*He scanned his surroundings. Ahead, a door led to a short hallway connected to another room.*
-# "Need to assess the area... and retrieve my weapons. Uncharted territory still remains a threat." **He thought.**


[12/11/2024 9:30 PM] Narration
Cole entered the hallway. Which way did he look towards first?


[12/11/2024 9:30 PM] Cole Mercer
*He looked to his left first.*


[12/11/2024 9:31 PM] Narration
The hallway ended rather shortly. He had the room all the way to the end of the hall it would seem.... The very end had a stack of boxes with no sense of organization to them...


[12/11/2024 9:33 PM] Cole Mercer
*The boxes piqued his curiosity. What's inside them? He wondered. But before investigating, he turned to his right. What would he see?*

https://cdn.tupperbox.app/pfp/159490756506157056/full/NqVBZ7tArSwkIN6E.png **"..."** Good old' Mathias with his usual demeanor. He was observing Cole from the comfort of the middle room table.

[12/11/2024 9:52 PM] Cole Mercer
*Cole locked eyes with Mathias from across the room. His curiosity shifted, suspecting this man was the friend Paige mentioned. They were strangers to each other.*

*His first thought was the obvious red flag: his missing handguns. He assumed they were in Mathias’ possession. Nevertheless, Cole approached, his eyes narrow and sharp.*

*To Mathias, it was probably apparent that Cole's large frame and black tactical suit made him a suspicious figure.*


[12/11/2024 10:23 PM] Mathias
Mathias shifted subtly before raising his arm that was beneath the table. It was cole's handgun that was passively gripped within the palm of his hand. **"You're awake."** Stating the obvious. Perhaps in an attempt to coax Cole to say something...Anything.


[12/11/2024 10:36 PM] Cole Mercer
*Cole continued his measured steps, closing the distance. His expression remained unchanged, his gaze unwavering—until it landed on the handgun in Mathias's grip. His **own** handgun. His eyes shifted back to Mathias, narrowing slightly as a flicker of realization crossed his mind.* 
# *This man wasn’t ordinary. It had been a while since Cole encountered someone like him.*
*His hands stayed tucked in his pockets, his movements deliberate. Now just a meter and a half away, he stopped. The silence hung heavy in the air. He didn’t speak. **He didn’t need to.***


[12/11/2024 10:37 PM] Mathias
He rose the gun to eye level, inspecting it for a moment... Then, his eyes *slllloooooowly* rose to Cole's eyes. Turning the barrel of the gun towards Cole.


[12/11/2024 10:44 PM] Cole Mercer
*Despite Mathias’ deliberate motion, Cole remained perfectly still, his eyes locked onto Mathias’ with an eerie intensity. No words were exchanged, yet the answer was already written in Cole’s gaze. **He understood.*** 

*His hands stayed buried in his pockets, his stance unshaken, as he continued to meet Mathias’ stare without flinching.*

[12/11/2024 11:25 PM] Cole Mercer
*Cole's gaze softened slightly, an unsettling calm settling over his demeanor. Without a word, he shifted to the wall behind him, leaning against it. The silence lingered briefly before he finally spoke, his voice low and edged with a chilling certainty.*  

**"The chamber was cleared,"** *he said, his tone deliberate, almost instructive.* **"Magazine's missing. You'd have better luck throwing it than firing."**


[12/11/2024 11:39 PM] Mathias
Without taking his eyes off of Cole. Mathias lowered the gun on the table and withdrew its magazine from his pocket and loaded it. **"Trained, unlike some glitch-heads that play pretend merc."** He then slide it to the other end of the table.


[12/11/2024 11:42 PM] Mathias
**"Paige filled me in on everything that is going on. We got problems and you could care less..."** He went to stand up. **"Unless it directly affects you. Which is does."** There was a pause. 
**"The CCR is going to be at our doorsteps in a week's time. We need to relocate soon. Question is, are you up to what is required of you?"**


[12/11/2024 11:48 PM] Cole Mercer
*Before answering Mathias' question, Cole stepped forward and picked up his handgun. His movements were deliberate as he inspected it, running his eyes over every detail. Satisfied, he holstered it with a smooth motion.*

*He briefly recalled leaving his mask in the other room—a thought he dismissed for now. He'd grab it when it **mattered.** Turning back to Mathias, his tone was calm but laced with an edge.* **“I’m still breathing. That’s __all__ you need to know.”**


[12/11/2024 11:52 PM] Mathias
**"Dusk, you're going to help me vet some locations. Somewhere the CCR already searched."** He stated.


[12/11/2024 11:53 PM] Mathias
**"Lucky for us I know how they methodically conduct searches."**


[12/12/2024 12:04 AM] Cole Mercer
*Cole gave a slow nod, his expression unchanged.*


[12/12/2024 12:05 AM] Mathias
**"Go ahead and familiarize yourself with this location. Worse case scenario, we'll be having a standoff."**


[12/12/2024 12:07 AM] Cole Mercer
*Cole moved, his footsteps steady and deliberate. Before leaving the room, his gaze lingered on the boxes in the other room. He was going to check them out, but decided it was better to get the answer from the old man.* **"What's in those boxes?"**


[12/12/2024 12:08 AM] Mathias
**"On the surface, junk. Ammunition."**


[12/12/2024 12:10 AM] Cole Mercer
*Cole's eyes narrowed slightly as he processed the brief answer. His voice remained flat, cold as ever.* **"I'm heading back to grab my mask."**


[12/12/2024 12:11 AM] Mathias
**"Sure."**

[1/5/2025 11:52 PM] Kode
`"I'm conscious; why am I conscious?"` He thought to himself as he roused. However, externally, he remained as still as possible. `"Air pressure is different, the temperature is cooler, ambient more chaotic... Old air conditioner?"`No longer was he in that jail. With that confirmed, he slowly opened his eyes just before sitting up. A low groan escaped the confines of his muzzle, a clear sign that he wasn’t getting any younger. He still wore the clothing the inmate had given to him when he was incarcerated. The dingy, dusty rose tint did not suit him well in his own mind.


[1/5/2025 11:58 PM] Cat Bayes
**”Mmh?”** *A young, Asian girl with short blue hair was sitting at a desk away from the bed, leaned back in a chair with a lax posture. Her eyes were flickering a vibrant orange with lines of code subtly dancing within her irises, indicating that she was looking at something on the NET.*

*Noticing that Kode was stirring, the girl’s gaze focused on him as the orange glow faded from her eyes, showing their true sapphire color.* **”Well well, rise and shine sleeping beauty!”**


[1/6/2025 12:05 AM] Kode
Kode glanced at the Asian woman for a brief moment. What situation had he gotten himself into this time? **"Sleeping Beauty feels like a distant fairy tale for someone in my boots... Was I thrown over the walls, and are you here to harvest my organs now?"** He half-joked, pulling his feet from the stiff bed to touch the ground as he faced the woman.


[1/6/2025 12:07 AM] Kode
He'd blink his eyes a few times... Some of those times were one at a time as his optical eyes began a calibration process.


[1/6/2025 12:08 AM] Cat Bayes
**”Yes, I’ve kidnapped you from a highly secure detention facility because I’m a zazzed out chrome scav who thought you looked like a tasty meal.”** *…She paused for a moment.* **”Or a vampire, in which case I’m gonna suck your blood now that you’re awake.”**


[1/6/2025 12:18 AM] Kode
Cat succeeded in coaxing a smile from Kode, transforming the corners of his mouth into a fleeting curve of amusement. **"Heh... I could ask a less engaging question.  Got a name? The purpose for kidnapping an old man?"**


[1/6/2025 12:21 AM] Cat Bayes
*Spotting the smile, she broke out into a chuckle before turning the chair to face him in full.* **”I’m Cat, and for why “we” *kidnapped* you, well…call it a personal favor from an old friend.”** *She folded her legs up to her chest, chin resting over her knees.* **”Feeling alright? No broken bones or weird glitches?”**


[1/6/2025 12:28 AM] Kode
**"No, they didn't touch me. Aside from the increasing long boot times, I am unscathed."** His eyes went down to the floor, then back up towards Cat after a moment of thought. **"You know her, Paige... She put you up to this, Didn't she?"**


[1/6/2025 12:30 AM] Cat Bayes
**”Yeah, she did.”** *Cat said with no hesitation, putting her feet back down on the floor as she stood up.* **”She was worried about you, the moment she felt something was off.”**


[1/6/2025 12:34 AM] Kode
He would roll his head to the side, exasperated, all in one motion. **"Ah, fuck..."** He uttered. **"That is the last thing I wanted to happen. I told her to get out."** It was evident that Kode was not happy with this news. However, why was he upset about being freed?


[1/6/2025 12:37 AM] Cat Bayes
**”Hm?”** *She raised an eyebrow to that. Evidently, he was upset about something or another relating to Paige, but she couldn’t understand why.* **”Are you talking about Paige? Get out of where, District 9?”** *Huh, this girl was pretty rapid fire with the questions, wasn’t she?*


[1/6/2025 12:43 AM] Kode
**"Yes... and —yes."** It was a good thing they preserved his glasses. His hand brushed up against the frame, which prompted him to grab it and put it on. **"Though, it doesn't surprise that she enlisted more people into these antics."**


[1/6/2025 12:48 AM] Cat Bayes
**”Well, mine’s a bit of a special case - but I’ll tell you bout that later if you wanna hear it.”** *Cat placed a hand on her hip, resting the other one on the desk as she pivoted her head to the side, eyes flashing orange once more…was she contacting someone?* **”Yo, choomba’s awake, wanna come give him some hugs and kisses?”**

*Turning away from the call, she gave Kode a look, before poking the side of her temple.* **”She saved my life, I owe her for that.”**


[1/6/2025 1:00 AM] Kode
**"..."** All Cat received from him was a slow exhale through his nostrils.


[1/6/2025 1:00 AM] Paige
The door swung open, and Paige hurried into the room. Her eyes were wide with recognition and concern. As soon as she spotted Kode before he could speak, Paige buried her face in his chest and hugged him tightly.


[1/6/2025 1:00 AM] Kode
**"!"** His expression softened when she collided with him. He couldn't help but remember when she was just a child. Slowly, he brought one arm over her shoulder and gave her a squeeze bag. **"Hey, kiddo... Sorry to make you worry."**


[1/6/2025 1:02 AM] Cat Bayes
*Cat was about to make a joke about the hug being checked off the list, but figured it’d probably be best to let them have this moment. For now, she remained quiet.*


[1/6/2025 1:33 AM] Paige
**"I'm just relieved you're alright..."** Paige pulled away from the embrace.


[1/6/2025 1:33 AM] Kode
He gave her a slight smile before it defaulted. **"Made new friends, I see."** Referring to Cat indirectly.


[1/6/2025 1:33 AM] Paige
She stood back up and backed away a couple of steps before turning back towards Cat for a brief moment. **"Yeah, Cat is like my sister. She has been there for me when no one else was."**


[1/6/2025 1:38 AM] Cat Bayes
**”Ch’yo.”** *Cat greeted with a friend wave, smiling at Paige for a moment. She was relieved at how happy her big sis seemed in that moment.*


[1/6/2025 1:45 AM] Kode
**"Yes, I was fortunate to meet just moments ago."** He glances neutrally at Cat before allowing them to return to Paige.

**"However, I'm afraid this reunion isn't ideal. I wish you had left the district. The CCR is coming after everyone, including Danny and the Dawson family. You need to get out while there’s still a chance."**


[1/6/2025 1:55 AM] Paige
**"What about helping them out too? We can all get out, especially with Fred's help."**


[1/6/2025 2:00 AM] Kode
Kode shifted in his seat, a hint of unease flickering across his face. He leaned closer, lowering his voice as if sharing a secret. **"Listen, Kiddo... they’re not your family anymore. That bond has faded."** His gaze softened with concern, urging,**"You need to concentrate on what’s bound to happen to your group right now..."**


[1/6/2025 2:02 AM] Kode
**"We have avoided extinction once... Next time we won't be so lucky.."**


[1/6/2025 2:04 AM] Paige
**"..."** Her eyes cast to the floor. **"They are upset about District 11. Aren't they?"**


[1/6/2025 2:11 AM] Kode
**"We all are... Nothing good will come out of trying to extend your hand to them. Believe me when I say I tried. But who knows, desperate people will resort to desperate measures."**


[1/6/2025 2:11 AM] Kode
**"I for one, would not count on it..."**


[1/6/2025 2:15 AM] Paige
She nodded, taking Kode's warning to heart. He and Mathias were the men in her life to whom she could entrust herself.

**"We have an issue we would need your expertise to handle. We've captured a CCR affiliate and we need to remove the cyber deck from her. Could you do it?"**


[1/9/2025 9:40 PM] Kode
**"I can do just about anything that involves the body."** He'd sigh, rubbing the back of his neck. Man, he slept like a rock, didn't he? His hands were not of the flesh, consisting of highly sophisticated servos and many different configurations lying underneath the shell. With a few twitches of his digits, he would move from his spot, gesturing towards the door. **"After you."**


[1/9/2025 9:40 PM] Paige
With a content smile, she nodded towards her best friend. Time to get the show on the road!


[1/10/2025 1:14 AM] Cat Bayes
*Returning the nod, Cat followed the two out of the room. Time to see what this Netrunner kid is hiding!*


[1/10/2025 9:02 PM] Narration
The trio entered a room at the end of the basement hall. It was barred from the outside to prevent any nonsense from occurring. Despite all the trouble, they went through to bring her here. She was still a potential threat that could jeopardize their entire resurgence. The sounds of whimpering could be heard through the hull. It would appear that someone was awake and __not__ having a great time. Right on cue, for the three.


[1/10/2025 9:02 PM] Paige
**"Deck it... This is making me feel worse and worse. Had it been anyone else, I would relish in the idea of them suffering."** Paige was exasperated as she began undoing the door restraints.


[1/10/2025 9:02 PM] Kode
Kode was taking in his surroundings as he stopped just before the door. Basement space was actually quite liveable, but the space was now a commodity that was becoming very finite. **"Who did you catch, anyways?"** Finally turning his attention to the women he was in company of.


[1/10/2025 9:16 PM] Cat Bayes
**"A kid who shouldn't have been there."** *Cat interjected with a sigh, rubbing her temple. She doesn't like recalling the argument she had with Ghost leading up to her capture, but all in all...at least she was still breathing.* **"She said she was doing this to provide for her family...but still, to think the CCR would hire someone so young."**


[1/10/2025 9:41 PM] Paige
**"It's what they do. Indoctrinate them young."** She would finally get the door open and would enter. Steeling herself for what was to come next.


[1/10/2025 9:41 PM] Dylan Hackett
Dylan was tied to a chair, her hands bounded behind the back of the seat and her legs tethered to the front leg posts. Her face had an extensive history of shedded tears and exhaustion. When the door opened, she was towards the tail end of her sniffling. Her head slowly raising to see the faces of her captors. 
**"You're not going to kill me now, are you?"** Her voice was hoarse. Having spent it on crying.


[1/10/2025 9:41 PM] Paige
**"That isn't even a thought..."** She stepped off to the side, leaning against the table in the corner. **"Unfortuantely, we are going to have to bug your privacy for a minute."**


[1/10/2025 9:52 PM] Cat Bayes
*Yeesh, that girl was in a bad state, Cat couldn't help but pity her.* **"Sorry for the way we treated you, but with the situation as...*delicate* as it is, we had to take some precautions."** *She explained, although it didn't really help the dryness in her throat from the guilt. This is the only way, the alternative for her is death.* **"I know this is gonna seem like a dumb question, but you holdin' up okay?"**


[1/10/2025 10:04 PM] Dylan Hackett
**"I want to go home.."** Is all she said at the time.


[1/10/2025 10:04 PM] Kode
Kode would approach the girl from her front. Looking down towards her. His cybernetic hand was outreached, seemingly coressing her jaw. But, in reality, he was getting his hand underneath her hair and pulling it back to reveal where neural port.


[1/10/2025 10:04 PM] Dylan Hackett
At first, Dylan did not know what he was doing until she felt the chill of the room kiss just behind her ear. **"W-what are you doing?"**


[1/10/2025 10:04 PM] Kode
**"Figuring out if we'll need to put you out."** He'd state matter-of-factly as he tilted her head in the direction he needed to get ample light on it.


[1/10/2025 10:04 PM] Dylan Hackett
**"I didn't call anyone!"** She'd exclaim. **"I wasn't going too!"**


[1/10/2025 10:04 PM] Kode
**"Yet."** With a few presses against her neck and skull. He pressed something that caused her eyes to go wide. Then, her head slumped forward. **"There we go."**


[1/10/2025 10:05 PM] Cat Bayes
*Cat gave Paige a look as if she were asking "Can he do that to me?"*

[1/10/2025 10:07 PM] Paige
She gave Cat a side eye. `"What the hell do you mean by that?"`


[1/10/2025 10:10 PM] Kode
**"Her deck is one of those annoying ones to deal with."** He comment as he grabbed the top of her head and brought it back towards him. **"Got to eject it by pressing on the Spinal accessory nerve."** His fingers elongated and narrowed, going inside of the neural port as his other hand continued to press on the nerve while holding her head upright.


[1/10/2025 10:12 PM] Cat Bayes
**"A-Ah, right..."** *Cat rubbed the back of her neck, feeling at the neural port that hid behind her blue hair. She was good with tech, sure, but she never knew you could just...turn a person off like that. Euugh.*


[1/10/2025 10:14 PM] Kode
He looked up at the ceiling as he continued to feel around. Then, he would pull and the port came out. Leaving a hole in the side of her head. Then, Kode released her head, allowing it to roll back foward.  **"Got any static bags?"** He'd ask, looking up with the port in his hands.


[1/10/2025 10:15 PM] Paige
**"Sorry, just ran out of those."**  She'd say sarcastically.


[1/10/2025 10:19 PM] Kode
**"Well, I suppose you don't care for infections."** He then find a plastic bag and wrap it. **"Dealt with your problem. Where is the other old man at? I got some catching up to do."** He'd direct his question towards Paige.


[1/10/2025 10:19 PM] Paige
**"Where we came from, down the hall to the right. Can't miss him."**


[1/10/2025 10:19 PM] Kode
**"Excellent."** He would casually walk past the two.


[1/10/2025 10:21 PM] Cat Bayes
**"Well, all's well end's well, huh?"** *Cat remarked, smirking over towards Paige.*


[1/10/2025 10:24 PM] Paige
**"Not exactly what I would consider a good ending. But I'll upvote this over alternatives anyday."**
Her attention went back towards Dylan. **"Don't know what we are going to do with her exactly... Can't keep her hostage forever."**


[1/10/2025 10:29 PM] Cat Bayes
**"Yeah, I'm not sure what we're gonna do either, she's kind of a ticking timebomb even though she's "defused"."** *Cat followed Paige's gaze, looking at the unconscious Dylan.*
*Standing in awkward silence for a few moments, Cat breathed out a sigh and rubbed the back of her head.* **"Sorry, this is kinda my fault, huh?"**


[1/10/2025 10:30 PM] Paige
**"Huh?"** Clarification girlfrand!


[1/10/2025 10:36 PM] Cat Bayes
**"I put us at risk letting her live, I know that."** *It's like Ghost said: when dealing with the CCR, you don't have time for emotions.* **"But..."**


[1/10/2025 10:39 PM] Cat Bayes
**"I dunno, it just didn't sit right with me."**


[1/10/2025 10:42 PM] Paige
Paige exhaled through her nose. Thinking everything over. **"I am picking up where you're coming from... She needed you, and you did what you thought was right. I personally can't fault you for that..."**


[1/10/2025 10:42 PM] Paige
**"We'll figure it out, like we always do."**

 *Although the doubt still lingered, Cat did feel a lot better hearing that from Paige. Straightening her shoulders, she let out a chuckle before bumping her shoulder against Paige's.* **"Yeah, like we always do."** *She recited back to her sister with closed eyes and a grin.*


[1/10/2025 10:56 PM] Paige
She allowed the silence to carry them for a while before, **"Come on, lets see what the others are getting themselves into."**


[1/10/2025 10:59 PM] Cat Bayes
**"Mmh."** *She nodded, before she turned and left the room.*


[1/10/2025 11:08 PM] Narration
Cat and Paige spilled out into the main room in the basement where Kode had found himself seated across Mathias. Cole was leaning against the wall on the far corner...


[1/10/2025 11:10 PM] Kode
**"Figured they wouldn't want to stay in the room with the girl for too long."** Kode remarked as he looked over his shoulder towards them. **"Have a seat, Mathias was just going over some things. Might want to be in attendance."**


[1/10/2025 11:10 PM] Cole Mercer
*His mask was off, his demeanor blank. He stared down at the ground in silence, almost as if he weren’t even in the room.*


[1/10/2025 11:15 PM] Cat Bayes
*Entering the room, Cat seemed to be avoiding looking at Cole for the time being, still disturbed from their last mission. Instead, she gave Kode an affirmative nod before moving over to find a seat.* **"Good, cause I've got something I need to share as well - from my last gig."**

**"I'll wait after Mathias, though."**


[1/10/2025 11:20 PM] Mathias
He gave a sublte nod. **"We are outgrowing this place. On top of that, the CCR will be ramping up their hunt for us."** He glanced towards Cole. **"Cole and I scouted some locations and found one that would allow us to remain off longer. But how long is still questionable. I say we move by tomorrow, no later."**


[1/10/2025 11:20 PM] Paige
**"We have a lot of shit to move."** Paige interjected, she would point her thumb in the general direction where she stashed the Ion Enforcers. **"I went ahead and scrambled the trackers on the trucks. Could use them to avoid suspicion. But, still, there is a mountain of things."**


[1/10/2025 11:24 PM] Cole Mercer
*Cole glanced at Mathias, then returned his gaze to where it had been fixed originally.*


[1/10/2025 11:30 PM] Kode
**"No rest for the wicked, I suppose. You'd be carrying dead weight."** Referring to Dylan. **"Should just leave her here and let her people find her. She won't be going anywhere anytime soon."**


[1/10/2025 11:30 PM] Paige
**"...We can transport her. It will be fine."** Paige spoke up.


[1/10/2025 11:31 PM] Cat Bayes
**"CCR's gonna think she's an accomplice either way, so either she's dead or she's dead."** *She eyed Cole for a moment before focusing on the group once more.* **"If push comes to shove, then I'll take responsibility for it."**

*Cole __**chuckled**__, a sound that felt entirely out of place, almost unnatural for him in the moment.*


[1/10/2025 11:34 PM] Mathias
He crossed his arms and lean back. There was no way he was going to get involved in this.


[1/10/2025 11:35 PM] Cat Bayes
*She winced, hearing that sound from where the Ghost was sitting, it __did__ sound unnatural.* **"My emotions got us caught up in this mess, and it's the reason she wasn't zeroed, so..."** *Cat sighed for a moment, eyes glued to the floor.* **"...Guess I'm just counting my ones, now."**


[1/10/2025 11:39 PM] Cole Mercer
*Cole remained silent; there was nothing more to say. He had made himself __perfectly clear__ earlier.*


[1/10/2025 11:41 PM] Cat Bayes
**"..."** *Every so often, Cat would glance up at the killer with the slight hint of anticipation in her eyes. She hated this silence from him, especially when- * **"Why didn't you kill her?"**


[1/10/2025 11:45 PM] Cole Mercer
*Cole looked up, finally making eye contact with Cat. He stopped leaning against the wall and stepped forward, getting a little bit closer to the group, albeit taking his distance. He did **not** break his eye contact.*

**"Dead bodies don’t talk, but fear? Fear does the work for you."**

**"It was Slade's specialty back in the day."** Murmuring to himself.


[1/10/2025 11:49 PM] Cat Bayes
**"You'd be surprised how much they actually do talk."** *Cat shot back, a little cryptic but I supposed that should be expected from a netrunner. Regardless, she shrugged and continued the conversation.* **"So, at the last minute you decided to change your mind and let the girl live a little longer? You seemed pretty dead set on killin' her on the comms."**


[1/10/2025 11:55 PM] Cole Mercer
*Cole stepped back, **not** out of pressure, but because he preferred the steady reassurance of a wall at his back. It brought him a sense of comfort, a habit ingrained from years of staying vigilant.*

*Crossing his arms, he responded coldly,* **"Plans change. You always have to be ready to adapt, especially when __someone__ can’t hold onto their word."** *His words were directed at Cat, not out of pettiness, but with the sharp edge of someone who knew just how high the stakes had been.*


[1/11/2025 12:10 AM] Cat Bayes
**"I kept my __word__ just fucking fine."** *Now Cat was starting to get a little pissed it seems, her grip tightening ever so slightly against the chair.* **"The mission was over, you killed a bunch of CCR patrolman and Kode was secure - that should've been it."** *Unlike Cole, she couldn't meet his eyes with the same determination as him - instead, there was something else there...guilt, mayhaps?*

**"Then I had to open my big fat mouth and send you off like some god damned blood hound to kill a fucking kid - and shit, you were *eager* to do it, too!"** *Uh...Cat?* **"Fuck the mission, am I right? As long as you got to satisfy your fucking murder boner or whatever!"**

 **"Yeah? What matters to you, then?"** *Cat asked, before she directed her gaze to the floor, the anger subsiding in her eyes as she sat back down.* **"...Sorry, don't let me hijack the meeting."** *She mentioned quietly, before going silent once more.*


[1/13/2025 12:50 PM] Cole Mercer
*Cole disregarded the question entirely and refocused on the original topic.* **"The two locations we scouted are viable for now,"** *he stated, his tone sharp and to the point.* **"An abandoned bank and a factory. Only one of them have potential."**  

*He locked eyes with Mathias and gave a curt nod, signalling him to take over the specifics.*


[1/13/2025 6:15 PM] Mathias
**"The factory has a sophisticated tunnel system. Connecting what I believe to be most of Kapea's drainage system. What's more is that Cole encountered a Purafish."**


[1/13/2025 6:15 PM] Narration
Both Paige and Kode's eyebrows rose at the mentioning of the creature. Everyone in the room aside from Cole (not anymore) and Cat were more than familiar in this case...


[1/13/2025 6:15 PM] Mathias
**"Plenty of space for everyone. Has a loading dock with a ramp; perfect for vehicles. Large underground network system to pop up almost anywhere in Kapea and northern Littleton. Reduces surface foot traffic and makes it harder for anyone to track the location. The bank is a heap of garbage, not worth our time."**


[1/13/2025 6:18 PM] Paige
**"A run-in with a Purafish means there is an access point from District 9... This is __HUGE__."** She emphasised the last word with her hands.


[1/13/2025 6:18 PM] Kode
**"If there is one Purafish, there are certainly at least two more... If you want to garner any benefit of those networks, you'll need to clear them out before any meaningful ops could be ran using them..."**


[1/13/2025 6:19 PM] Cat Bayes
**"I'm sorry, a little bit lost here...Purafish?"** *Cat raised an eyebrow as well at the mention of the unfamiliar creature, but not for the same reason as Kode and Paige.*


[1/13/2025 6:23 PM] Kode
**"Ugly bastards, if there is one way I can describe them. It's ugly, slimely and nasty. Mutated water-based creatures that grown tenticle like legs and are about the size of a full-size van."** He'd explain, looking over his shoulder towards the blue hair asain.


[1/13/2025 6:24 PM] Cat Bayes
**"Huh, think I've seen BD bout one of those before, never knew that's what it was called."** *...What?* **"Actually, might've been something else now that I think about it."**


[1/13/2025 6:26 PM] Kode
**"uuuh..."**


[1/13/2025 6:26 PM] Paige
**"Cat used to run a BD store. Don't think too hard about it, Kode."** She'd come to Cat's rescue.

**"Okay..."**

**"Hey, money's not that hard to come by in Haven Heights if you know the right alleys."** *Cat shrugged, remaining casual about that little bombshell.*


[1/13/2025 6:27 PM] Mathias
He would rub his face wearily as he addressed Cat. **"You had something to insert?"**


[1/13/2025 6:34 PM] Cat Bayes
**"A few things, actually."** *She straightened her posture, the usual fun-loving facade on her face being replaced with a serious grimace.* **"Wanted to wait until we were all here, talking bout it over the net seemed like a bad idea at the time...no idea who could be listening."**

*Looking around, she nodded before continuing.* **"In the last gig I ran, I came across some real fucked up data from BioTek: research logs and supply manifestos, even a budget plan for a project involving some kind of...Super Soldier project. Super Soldiers they can *clone.*"**

Seems like the Horizon Grey members were quite well versed in this. Interesting, she could ask more questions on this or continue...


[1/13/2025 6:49 PM] Cat Bayes
*Ah, so they know about it. Kinda disappointing that she couldn't have her big reveal, but whatever! Makes things easier.* **"Well, it looks like they're working on in, full steam ahead...in fact, hey Paige?"** *She looked over towards her friend.* **"You remember the BD I showed you? The one that...well, you know which one."**


[1/13/2025 6:50 PM] Paige
**"Yeah... Come to think about.."** She looked distant as she tried to remember the details.

**"Why else would he show up?"** *The gears were turning in her head.* **"What if...he was actually the guy in charge of the project?"**


[1/13/2025 6:53 PM] Paige
Paige gave Cat a look. **"...I think we might have found our guy in that case..."**


[1/13/2025 6:59 PM] Cat Bayes
**"..."** *Her hands clenched into the chair, the memories of that man's face flashing clear in her mind. She's had enough distractions since coming to Horizon Grey to keep her from going after the bastard, but now...it might finally be time to look into him.*

**"Mmh...I'll dive into the Net and start looking for names once we're settled at the new hideout."** *She said quietly, the anger just barely concealed in her voice, before looking back up to the group.* **"Aside from that, does the name London ring any bells to you?"**


[1/13/2025 7:06 PM] Paige
**"London? As the city of London?"**

**"Well...Yes, London is not far from this District... By vehicle... Give or take, an hour from the Monita border; In Ruins..."**


[1/13/2025 7:06 PM] Mathias
**"Before the fallout, London was one of the world's largest cities. Now, it is one of the world's largest ruins... There is nothing there but rotware and 'meat'."**


[1/13/2025 7:08 PM] Cole Mercer
*Cole paused, his gaze dropping to the floor in thought. His **mask** sat on the plastic table beside him, untouched. Without a word, he reached over, picking it up with a smooth motion. In one fluid gesture, he slid it back on, concealing his face once more...*

[1/13/2025 7:08 PM] Ghost
*With his thoughts now focused, he recalled seeing something like that once or twice in his life. The memories were faint, buried beneath years of experience. But in the end, __it didn’t matter.__*

**“Doesn’t ring a bell.”** *he said flatly, his tone devoid of hesitation or sentiment.*

[1/13/2025 7:15 PM] Cat Bayes
**"The...fallout?"** *Cat looked in confusion to the group. It didn't seem like they were talking about District 11, but from the way they were putting it, it was just as bad.* **"And...meat, like the monsters in the wasteland you mentioned before, Mathias?"**


[1/13/2025 7:21 PM] Mathias
**"What I am referring to is the world war that involved the destruction of most if not all the nations that existed prior. People bombing people indiscrimintately in assured mutual destruction. Nations fell and in their fall rose new ones. Vespera and Brillion are the two largest ones standing currently."**

He would reach forward and take within his hands a metal cup. **"Meat is a term for people __without__ a single implant or cybernetics."**


[1/13/2025 7:21 PM] Paige
**"There are also monsters... Plenty of those as well.."**


[1/13/2025 7:23 PM] Ghost
**"Like one of those Purafish I took out?"** *he stated, his tone analytical as he tried to piece together what other threats might be lurking.*


[1/13/2025 7:26 PM] Mathias
**"Exactly."** With a sip, he continued. **"A grey haze perminates the land for a better portion of the day. Allows for a lot of things to get the jump on you."**


[1/13/2025 7:27 PM] Paige
**"That is why it's important we get you familiar with firearms and weapons in general."** Referring to Cat. **"Netrunning won't work on anyone on the outside that isn't decked out paramilitary or the two heavy weights."**


[1/13/2025 7:29 PM] Ghost
*Ghost raised his right hand, his gaze fixed on his open palm. Something __weighed heavily__ on his mind.*


[1/13/2025 7:30 PM] Paige
She noticed Ghost's hand and addressed it. **"What is it?"**

{Reactions}
yk 🐐

[1/13/2025 7:31 PM] Ghost
*Ghost didn’t hesitate, his voice cold and direct.* 

**"Upgrades. I need them, __plenty.__"**


[1/13/2025 7:35 PM] Paige
**"I agree. I've earned some micros while workin with Digit, but not enough to really spec up any time soon."**


[1/13/2025 7:40 PM] Cat Bayes
**"I'll need some upgrades too, it's been a while since I've done a deep dive."** *Ah right, that reminded Cat.* **"Oh, Paige, I think I mentioned this after the hit on the communications tower, but I saw something a little troubling."**

**"Someone decrypted Kode's location before us, meaning we weren't the only ones zeroing in on em."** *She turned her attention to Kode, now.* **"Is there anyone you know who'd be searching for you, another member from Horizon Grey maybe?"**


[1/13/2025 7:52 PM] Kode🍰
**"...."** He rested his head in the palm of his hand. Thinking on it, who in their mind would want to get his location? Was it Cole? His gaze went towards the now masked man. `"No, he isn't capable of that. Plus, it was too short of notice."`


[1/13/2025 7:52 PM] Mathias
Mathias was thoughtful as well, closing his eyes and leaning further back into his chair.


[1/13/2025 7:52 PM] Narration
Moments passed, silence overtook the room before the two flatly said, **"Slade."**


[1/13/2025 7:52 PM] Paige
**"Slade is still running around, huh?"** She would rest her arm against her sister's shoulder.


[1/13/2025 7:52 PM] Paige
**"District 9 of all places too."** She murmured.


[1/13/2025 7:53 PM] Cat Bayes
*Cat was now Paige's armrest, confirmed! Didn't help with her confusion once more.* **"Slade?"** *She asked, completely unfazed with Paige.*


[1/13/2025 7:55 PM] Ghost
*Ghost tilted his head slightly, his ears catching the name. It didn’t ring any bells.*


[1/13/2025 7:56 PM] Kode🍰
**"That unhinged nutjob has been hellbent. Persistent on finding any reminents of Horizon Grey. Be it members, tech, or the core idelogies that the group was founded on."**


[1/13/2025 7:56 PM] Mathias
**"He __was__ my best friend. He was level-headed and cool at first. But the cause led him to develop some sort of radical ideology far beyond the original vision."**


[1/13/2025 7:58 PM] Mathias
**"The price you pay for having too many leaders and not enough followers."** He sounded reminiscent with that last statement.


[1/13/2025 7:59 PM] Paige
**"How would Slade be able to locate you anyways? Last I knew, he wasn't some netrunning guru."**


[1/13/2025 7:59 PM] Ghost
**"Probably knows someone who can get it done."** *he said, his arms remaining firmly crossed.*


[1/13/2025 8:00 PM] Kode🍰
Pointing towards Ghost while maintaining eye contact with Paige. **"Took the words right out of my mouth."**


[1/13/2025 8:03 PM] Cat Bayes
**"So what if I locate him first?"** *Cat piped up, her eyes flashing orange as she activated her cyberdeck.* **"Whoever he hired to find Kode was good, but their pullout game sucked ass."** *Should probably use a different phrase for that-* **"They left a footprint for me to trace, managed to get their identification key and everything."**


[1/13/2025 8:06 PM] Kode🍰
**"I don't think that would be a good idea."** He would interject. **"Slade is not exactly the most accomendating individual by far. Seeking him out would bring along his baggage."**


[1/13/2025 8:07 PM] Paige
**"... I would have to agree, but if things were to go south fast, we could use his expertise."**


[1/13/2025 8:07 PM] Kode🍰
**"Careful what you wish for."**


[1/13/2025 8:09 PM] Paige
**"Then, lets settle down the middle. When we get the time, we keep an eye out on him and the others, Danny and Freddie-o. That way, we keep our options open encase we get desperate."**


[1/13/2025 8:11 PM] Kode🍰
**"Much better than mindlessly jumpin recruitin everyone."** Kode would stand up. **"You guys saved my old ass and it is not like I can go back to my cushion gig... I say we get started on getting our new base squared. Then we can start talking upgrades for you junkies, eh?"**


[1/13/2025 8:11 PM] Mathias
He'd grunt.


[1/13/2025 8:12 PM] Ghost
*He nodded.*


[1/13/2025 8:13 PM] Cat Bayes
**"I like upgrades! Sounds like a plan to me."** *Seems like Cat was finished with her report, her own arm wrapping around Paige's as she too used her as an armrest! Geez, they really did look like sisters, huh.*


[1/13/2025 8:16 PM] Ghost
*Cole's head shifted towards Cat, his eyes locking onto her for a moment. It was unclear to anyone what he was thinking beneath the mask...*


[1/13/2025 8:16 PM] Cat Bayes
*Cat met his gaze for a moment, before she looked away...*

[1/22/2025 8:18 PM] Narration
As the days slipped by for the Horizon Grey team, their relocation efforts unfolded seamlessly, but an air of anticipation hung heavy in the night. Tonight marked their final evening in this 'abandoned house.' The hour was late, and the typical aura of Haven Heights gossiped unknown through the slums of The Stacks—outlying sirens lingered just beyond reach. At the same time, gunshots punctuated the darkness, articulating in a language known only to those who called this place home. The night was alive with a sense of prognostication as if the very walls were watching their every move. 

It was Mathias and Paige finishing up the remaining of the work required to finally call Kapea home.


[1/22/2025 8:18 PM] Mathias
Coming out the back door that spilled out into the alleyway, Mathias was the first one out, both hands at his side, carrying large crates as if they were grocery bags. The Ion Enforcer they nabbed almost a week prior was parked underneath a underpass not too far from here.


[1/22/2025 8:18 PM] Paige
Paige, having a much smaller frame than Mathias could only handle one. Carry it with both her hands and her back. Once out onto the alley, she placed it down with a thud, exhasperating due to the exertion it caused her. **"Phew... These things weight like a truck."** She muttered, pulling the handle so that she could drag it in a position she could optimally pick it back up.


[1/22/2025 8:18 PM] Mathias
Mathias came to a stop and looked back towards Paige. **"You could make two trips."** He stated lowly, his eyes moving from her form to the street behind her.


[1/22/2025 8:18 PM] Paige
Taking a few deep breaths to steady herself, she grasped the heavy object and heaved it up to her knees, feeling the strain in her arms. With a determined waddle, she shuffled a few steps toward him, her legs slightly bent under the weight. **"It's getting late, and I’m really tired of dragging these up the ladder from the dark, cramped basement,"** she complained, her voice reflecting a mix of frustration and fatigue.

With a frustrated sigh, she finally dropped the load to the floor, grateful for the brief moment of relief. She decided to take a little break, plopping down on top of the lid as she caught her breath. After a moment, she looked up at him with a weary expression, though what she wanted to talk about was serious. **"I need to ask you something,"** she said, placing her hands on her legs as she leaned forward.


[1/22/2025 8:31 PM] Mathias
Mathias, being the way he is remained silent as he waited for Paige to get on with her question. Not putting down the crates in his hands.


[1/22/2025 8:31 PM] Paige
**"You've been more involved with what we are doing... I have seen it. We all have seen it. Just a couple weeks ago, we had an argument and you made it clear you wanted nothing to do with leading. But, that is not the case, is it?"**


[1/22/2025 8:31 PM] Mathias
He didn't say anything, as his gaze focused on her intently, his eyebrows furrowing slightly.


[1/22/2025 8:31 PM] Paige
**"What changed?"** Paige asked, her voice carrying a soft but curious tone.


[1/22/2025 8:31 PM] Mathias
**"Am I really that invested?"** Mathias inquired, his voice remaning steady as he maintained her gaze.


[1/22/2025 8:31 PM] Paige
**"To be frank, yes. You are,"** she replied. She paused briefly before continuing. **"Ever since we brought in Cole, when we broke Kode out of that shit-hole, I have seen it. You're always in the front seat, like the old days. Leading the charge... You're the one calling the shots, telling us what to do."** Her expression softened even more as she added, **"Don't get me wrong, I only say this with good intention, I appreciate what you're doing... I know I can't lead no matter how good I think I am. When it matters the most, I cannot take a step back, survey what is before us and make good judgement calls."**


[1/22/2025 8:51 PM] Mathias
His silence lingered in the air for a moment. He inhaled deeply before responding. **"You're right, I'm more involved in this than I should be."** His tone was filled with a blend of resignation and certainty. **"I won't deny that,"** he added, his voice carrying a sense of finality.


[1/22/2025 8:51 PM] Paige
Paige nodded slowly, her expression a mix of understanding and gratitude. She acknowledged the sincerity in his words, recognizing the shift in his approach over the past two weeks. **"Why, though? What's driving this change in you? Is it me?"**


[1/22/2025 8:51 PM] Mathias
**"It's because you need a leader. And that isn't you..."** Mathias stated a slight twinge of harshness in his voice. His gaze held firm as he added, **"And frankly, it isn't anyone else on this 'team' either."** He would continue, **"Cat isn't experienced enough to lead. She has __NO__ idea what she is getting herself into, even with how much maturing she has had in these stressful situations. Kode knows how to lead but cannot maintain accountability when the going gets tough. Cole is a cold-blooded murderer, yes, but cannot empathize and connect with the rest of us. And as for you,"** he paused, his tone softening as he continued, **"You're too soft, and as you have said, you're too afraid to make decisions, even when it's necessary. You're driven by emotion and that right there has led you to almost getting killed countless times."**


[1/22/2025 8:52 PM] Paige
Paige winced slightly at his words, the blunt assessment stinging despite its accuracy. She knew he wasn't entirely wrong; her emotional nature had put her and her comrades in precarious situations (more times than not), and her inability to take decisive action had cost them opportunities and put them all in danger. However, she couldn't deny that his words struck a chord deep within her. **"So, that's it, then? I know I am not fit to lead. And I don't have any hard feelings about that; I can't blame you for thinking that. It is true, after all. But what does that have anything to do with you being so heavily involved? Why are you so motivated to make this work?"**


[1/22/2025 8:52 PM] Mathias
**"It's because of you and your friend's conviction to make something out of this mess."** He stated. **"I have seen how you two are struggling, and it pains me to see it. I cannot sit and watch you destroy yourselves. You're good kids. I __need__ to ensure I see you both on your way to great things... So pay more attention and keep your 'sister's well-being at the forefront of your thoughts. Can't have another Felicity incident."**


[1/22/2025 8:52 PM] Paige
A momentary silence fell between them as his words resonated in the night air. Paige's face was a mix of emotions, her gaze fixed on him as she processed his words. She let out a deep breath, her shoulders relaxing as she leaned forward slightly, resting her arms on her knees. **"Thank you,"** she finally said; ** "I won't let you down again."**


[1/22/2025 9:12 PM] Mathias
A slight smirk graced his face for just a moment before the boom of the sound barrier breaking above their heads. The ground shook with the force of a large explosion. Mathias instinctively grabbed Paige, pulling her close to shield her from any potential debris.


[1/22/2025 9:12 PM] Narration
The night sky, usually dimly illuminated by the slums and the distant city lights, was momentarily engulfed in an eerie blue glow that pierced through the darkness. The sound was deafening, reverberating across the desolate streets of the district. Above them was the ever imposing Steel Titan; The destroyer flagship of Vespera.


[1/22/2025 9:12 PM] Paige
Paige's eyes widened in disbelief as the massive ship sliced through the sky, its sheer size overwhelming her. Her heart thundered in her chest, a wild fusion of fear and exhilaration as she absorbed the imposing sight of the Titan. **"What the hell is the Titan doing here?!" **she shouted, her voice straining against the relentless roar of the engines. The thunderous roar engulfed her, vibrating through the air and drowning out all other sounds, creating an atmosphere charged with tension and uncertainty.


[1/22/2025 9:12 PM] Mathias
**"MOVE!"** Mathias bellowed, his voice cutting through the chaos like a siren. Panic surged from beneath Mathias' frame as the ground beneath them trembled violently, sending shockwaves through their bodies. With adrenaline fueling his every movement, Mathias seized Paige’s arm, his grip firm as he yanked her towards the narrow refuge of the underpass just beyond the alley. Each step reverberated in their bones, the earth convulsing beneath their feet, as if it were trying to swallow them whole.


[1/22/2025 9:12 PM] Paige
Paige stumbled, her legs quaking almost to the point of collapse, but Mathias pulled her onward, forcing her to focus. They could only run, heartbeats syncing with the frantic rhythm of the chaos around them, desperately seeking safety amid the unraveling turmoil.


[1/22/2025 9:12 PM] Narration
The massive Steel Titan towered ominously overhead, its metallic form casting a long shadow over the landscape. Beneath its armored exterior, a colossal cannon began to thrum with an eerie energy, the sound reverberating like the heartbeat of a monstrous beast. Sparks danced along its underbelly as it calibrated, each pulse of power sending a shiver through the air. With a deafening roar, the cannon charged, light crackling around its barrel as it locked onto the precise coordinates of their secret hideout. Time seemed to slow, the tension hanging thick as the impending force prepared to unleash its wrath.

Then, a laser fired at the roof of the building with the diameter of a coin. Instantaneously burning a hole through each layer like butter. Then, without warning it erupted, expanding with lightning like plasma scattering and obilteraing everything. Mathias and Paige were sent flying from the concussion, Mathias tumbled down the alleyway, hitting a large trash container and sheering through it like wet paper. Paige tumbled down the alleyway, out into the street, and underneath the underpass where she vanished into the darkness where the plasma couldn't shine. 

Light blinding anything... and everything....
