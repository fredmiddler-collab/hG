[6/3/2023 8:30 PM] Narration
Ghost made his way to the Metro. Which was nothing short from bustling. Here a lot of shady people resided, socializing and hanging out around makeshift pubs and store fronts. Observing the Metro, it seemed like honest business is being dealt. Though, only being there for a few moments, Ghostgaze has already seen merchants taking clients out back to check out the premium wares.


[6/3/2023 8:40 PM] Ghostgaze
*Ghostgaze navigated through the crowded Metro, his gaze __alert__ and his __senses__ heightened. The atmosphere was thick with a mix of anticipation and tension, as shady figures conducted their business discreetly. As he passed by the makeshift pubs and store fronts, he __noticed__ the subtle exchange of goods and hushed conversations, signaling the presence of __illicit transactions.__ Ghostgaze's trained eye caught glimpses of merchants discreetly leading clients to secluded areas, likely to showcase their exclusive merchandise away from prying eyes. With each passing moment, Ghostgaze absorbed the dynamics of the Metro, __mentally mapping__ potential contacts and assessing the risk versus reward of each interaction. He remained focused, his objective clear: __to establish reliable connections with suppliers who could provide him with the essential resources he needed.__*


[6/3/2023 9:07 PM] Narration
There was one person who was selling 'Self-Defense' weapons in a stall up ahead. Business was slowing down a bit, the owner finding pause within the enegeric waves of people moving to and from.


[6/3/2023 9:07 PM] Narration
Of course, these weapons were fashioned so that would not break any mandates.


[6/3/2023 9:15 PM] Ghostgaze
*Ghost approached the stall with caution, weaving through the crowd with a deliberate and purposeful stride. He kept his guard up, scanning the surroundings for any signs of trouble. As he reached the self-defense weapon stall, he observed the assortment of items on display.*


[6/3/2023 9:51 PM] Narration
There was an whole assortment of weapons that he could see. Machetes, sharpened pipes, short blades, weapons that resembled swords, bats, knuckle dusters and switch blades. The guy had it all.


[6/3/2023 9:51 PM] Hector "Hect"
**"Aren't you a funny lookin one."** The owner of the shop would remark. He was a young individual with shades that obscured his eyes. Elbows pressed against the counter, he would make sure Ghost understand that his attention was directed to him.

[6/3/2023 9:57 PM] Ghostgaze
*Ghost met the gaze of the shop owner, his expression remaining neutral and impassive. He didn't bother responding to the comment, instead __focusing on the available weapons.__ His eyes narrowed as he assessed the assortment, searching for items that would suit his needs. He didn't have time for small talk or unnecessary banter. Ghost's attention remained fixed on the weapons, his hand __instinctively__ hovering near his Midnight Edge handgun, __ready to defend himself if necessary.__ The shop owner wouldn't be able to see this since Ghostgaze's cloak is concealing it.*


[6/3/2023 10:09 PM] Hector "Hect"
**"Alright then, more of a browser than a smoocher."**


[6/3/2023 10:16 PM] Ghostgaze
*Ghost glanced at the shop owner, unamused by his remark. After a moment of silent contemplation, he got straight to the point.* **"I'm looking for heavier firepower. Where do you keep the bigger guns?"** *His voice was low and devoid of any unnecessary pleasantries. Ghost didn't have time for __idle chatter;__ he had a specific objective in mind, and he wanted to cut through the small talk and get to the __business at hand.__*


[6/3/2023 10:18 PM] Hector "Hect"
**"Bigger...guns?"** His eyebrows raising above his frames. **"Listen choom, I don't deal with __bigger guns__. iight, second off. Do I know you from somewhere?"**


[6/3/2023 10:21 PM] Ghostgaze
*Ghost's expression remained unchanged, his gaze steady as he listened to the shop owner's response. __Without uttering a word,__ he turned and walked away, not bothering to entertain further conversation. The shop owner's question about recognizing him went __unanswered.__ Ghost had no interest in engaging in idle banter or revealing more about himself than necessary.*


[6/3/2023 10:24 PM] Hector "Hect"
**"You know, I have always been good at recongizing faces and of course the get-ups of very popular people."** He would say towards him.


[6/3/2023 10:24 PM] Hector "Hect"
**"Part of the biz. Got to know who may be your next customer."**


[6/3/2023 10:29 PM] Ghostgaze
*Ghost paused in his tracks, his body tensing slightly as he turned his head back towards the shop owner. His voice, __low and deep,__ carried a stern tone as he spoke,* **"I'm not interested in idle gossip or prying into anyone's business. My focus is on acquiring __what I need,__ nothing more."** *His eyes remained fixed on the shop owner, a silent warning that any further intrusion into his affairs would __not be tolerated.__*


[6/3/2023 10:34 PM] Hector "Hect"
**"Straight laced, though that kind of mentality can get you killed faster than you think."**
He tilted his head to the side, a sly look in his eye. **"You told me too much asking for bigger shit. If I was a narc then you'd been fucked. You in the Metro choom; read the room."** He would stand up straight, **"Whatcha need?"**


[6/3/2023 10:35 PM] Hector "Hect"
**"If I don't got it, I know everyone who got it."**


[6/3/2023 10:38 PM] Ghostgaze
*Ghost listened to the shop owner's words, acknowledging the potential danger of being too open about his intentions. He kept his guard up, realizing the importance of being discreet in such an environment. After a moment of consideration, he leaned slightly closer to the shop owner and asked in a hushed tone,* **”Impact grenades. Where can I acquire them?”** *His gaze locked onto the shop owner's eyes, waiting for his response.*


[6/3/2023 10:48 PM] Hector "Hect"
**"You can acquire the finest knifes at this fine establishment. Let me show you my overstock."** He would gesture for Ghost to follow him from behind the counter. Opening the metal door that led into the building portion of the stall with a passcode.


[6/3/2023 10:50 PM] Ghostgaze
*Ghost followed the shop owner, keeping a vigilant eye on their surroundings as they entered the building portion of the stall. He remained cautious, prepared for any unexpected turns of events. His focus was solely on acquiring the information and resources he needed to further his goals.*


[6/4/2023 1:27 PM] Narration
Ghost would follow the shop owner to the back. The storehouse connected to his stall was the treasure trove of the man's operations. The distinct smell of machine oil and gunpower would assault Ghost's nostrils. On each wall except for the back wall racks of rifles occupied the space. The far wall had more, interesting pieces of equipment. Explosives, grenades, bombs. Name it, he probably had it.


[6/4/2023 1:27 PM] Hector "Hect"
He was already filtering through the drawers and shelves on the far wall. Each item was labelled and were in mint condition aside from a few things as if they came straight from the manufactures. **"How many?"** He would turn halfway towards Ghostgaze.


[6/4/2023 1:50 PM] Ghostgaze
*Ghostgaze's eyes scanned the impressive array of weapons and explosives in the storehouse. The meticulous organisation and pristine condition of the items indicated the shop owner's expertise and attention to detail. Ghostgaze's focus remained unwavering as he replied in his deep, steady voice,* **"I need a small box of impact grenades, as discreet as possible. Around ten."** *He stood with a composed demeanour, awaiting the shop owner's response.*


[6/4/2023 7:33 PM] Hector "Hect"
**"250 ₥R a unit. So for 10? 2,500 ₥R."**


[6/4/2023 7:41 PM] Ghostgaze
*Ghostgaze considered the price for the impact grenades, assessing its worth for his operations. After a brief pause, he nodded in agreement.* **"Deal,"** *he replied calmly.* **"Now, do you have any smoke grenades available as well?"** *Ghostgaze recognized the value of smoke grenades in creating distractions and obscuring visibility during his missions.*


[6/4/2023 7:49 PM] Hector "Hect"
**"My dear client, I had RGO grenades. How would I not have smoke grenades?"** He was in the process of boxing up his impacts in an unlabeled box. He would look up from his current task, reaching onto one of the shelves and showing up the smoke grenade from where he stood. **"50 ₥R a piece."**


[6/4/2023 7:51 PM] Ghostgaze
*Ghostgaze nodded at the shop owner's response.* **"I'll take ten smoke grenades as well,"** *he requested, maintaining his composed demeanor. He watched as the shop owner retrieved the smoke grenades from the shelf and prepared them for purchase. Ghostgaze was determined to ensure he had the necessary tools to navigate with efficiency and precision.*


[6/4/2023 7:54 PM] Hector "Hect"
**"Hope you have fun carrying these around."** He would box them up as well.


[6/4/2023 8:02 PM] Ghostgaze
*Ghostgaze accepted the boxed impact grenades and smoke grenades, carefully taking them from the shop owner. He maintained his stoic expression as he spoke, his voice low and firm.* **"I appreciate your assistance. If I ever need to resupply, I will come to you,"** *he stated firmly, acknowledging the shop owner's reliability. He then added,* **"By any chance, do you happen to have an __ice pick?__"**

[6/4/2023 8:16 PM] Hector "Hect"
**"An Ice pick? Don't got one in stock. Know where I can get one though. I'd say, give me a day or two and you'll have your pick."**


[6/4/2023 8:18 PM] Ghostgaze
*Ghostgaze nodded in response to the shop owner's words.* **"Very well, take your time. I'll await your update on the ice pick,"** *he said with his usual stoic demeanor.*

*As Ghostgaze prepared to take his leave, he turned to the shop owner and asked,* **"Before I go, what should I call you?"**


[6/4/2023 8:21 PM] Hector "Hect"
**"Hect."**


[6/4/2023 8:28 PM] Ghostgaze
*Ghostgaze acknowledged the name with a nod.* **"I'll be in touch, Hect."** *he said, his tone remaining neutral and professional. With that, Ghostgaze turned and exited the storehouse, ready to proceed with his plans, now equipped with the necessary supplies.*


[6/4/2023 8:46 PM] Ghostgaze
*Ghostgaze made his way back to the hideout, his mind focused on the task ahead. He navigated through the bustling streets, blending in with the crowds as he moved with purpose. __The weight of the supplies__ he had acquired pressed against his side, a reminder of the tools at his disposal.*

[1/4/2025 5:54 PM] Narration
Kaedues descends down the staircase for a short duration until he is spit out into an underground market. The narrowed, curved space feels alive with pulsing energy. The crowd is a mix of hardened regulars, their faces etched with caution and weariness, and a few adventurous newcomers whose eyes dart nervously at every shadow. Scattered across the market, stalls and vendors display an array of gear for sale—racks of weapons gleam under the neon lights, from sleek energy rifles to brutal, handmade melee tools. Armor pieces, tactical rigs, and other combat gear hang like trophies alongside tables stacked with cybernetic enhancements, rare data chips, and untraceable tech.

It’s a place that feels both lawless and strangely organized, as if it operates by an unspoken code that everyone instinctively understands. Despite the chaotic atmosphere, there’s a sense of unwritten rules and respect, born out of necessity in this underground haven.


[1/4/2025 5:54 PM] Hector "Hect"
**"Hey."** A guy from a large stall neighboring the door Kaedues came out of called out to him. **"Was told you needed something appraised."**

[1/4/2025 5:59 PM] Narration
Leaning against the bar of the stall was a man who had two guns holstered on thigh holsters and a distinct set of attire.


[1/4/2025 5:59 PM] Luke
**"This that new guy?"** Luke inquired to Hect.

[1/4/2025 5:59 PM] Hector "Hect"
**"Yeah."** He muttered back to Luke before turning his body to face the direction Kaedues was.


[1/4/2025 6:29 PM] Kaedues Staub
*Kaedues gives the area a scan with his eyes. The way the people look at him, strangely enough, gives Kaedues a sense of comfort. In their situation, he would do the same, and that is grounding.*

*First, he looks at Hector. Then, Luke.. and finally, Hector again. He nods.* **"I do need something appraised. What do you charge?"**


[1/4/2025 6:35 PM] Hector "Hect"
**"Friend paid forward upstairs. What you got?"**


[1/4/2025 6:38 PM] Kaedues Staub
*Kaedues raises his cybernetic hand.*
**"I do not know where I got it,"** *Kaedues says.* **"Wish I could tell you more. I know that it's expensive. Give or take.. 15,000 micros? Somewhere in that range. I just want to know what kind of manufacturer could make this."**


[1/4/2025 6:39 PM] Hector "Hect"
Hector leans in a bit before extending both his hands towards him. **"May I?"**


[1/4/2025 6:45 PM] Kaedues Staub
**"I do not know how to remove it. I only started moving give or take half an hour ago."**
*He extends his hand, allowing for Hector to take a look at the hardware.*


[1/4/2025 6:47 PM] Hector "Hect"
He would flip his dominate hand palm up and brought it beneath Kaedues' cybernetic hand. With his thumb and index finger, he pressed the large circular disks where the start of his palm would be. Immediately, underneath his fingers. The led went from blue to yellow, soft illumination through his flesh. With a clock-wise twist relative to Kaedues the hand came off seamlessly. Every blue emitted light on the hand went into a pulsing yellow. 

All was left was the base which looked extremely intricate. If Kaedues attempted to wiggle his fingers, he could still do so with it detached!

**"This is an Argent Nexus V3. State of the art cybernetic. Versatile and has limited detached locomotion capability. Flex your fingers as if it was still there."**

[1/4/2025 6:52 PM] Kaedues Staub
*Kaedues closes his fist, and his eyebrows raise when he sees the fingers of the mechanical haand actually close.*
**"Thanks. Argent, you said? Heard of a BioTek project here and there that worked with them. Do you know where they operate?"** *Kaedues moves on to ask.*


[1/4/2025 7:00 PM] Hector "Hect"
**"Not from the top of my dome."** He would set the closed fist hand on the counter and moved away from the counter. Kaedues could see him go to one of his shelfs, indexing through them before. **"What makes this even more nova is that it has __multiple__ addons. Here is an addon that you can connect in it's place. Syncs directly to your wrist dock."** He would come out with weird looking device with a tri-prong hook; A grappling hook?!

**"15,000 Micros is a low-ball. We're well above 50,000 micros."**

[1/4/2025 7:04 PM] Kaedues Staub
**"..I could use something like that,"** *Kaedues comments out loud.* **"How much weight does that support?"**


[1/4/2025 7:12 PM] Hector "Hect"
**"The hook holds 200 pounds confidently. Exceed 250 and you have issues waiting to happen. Could snap the cable or worst, rip your wrist dock clean off of your forearm and that is to be avoided."**


[1/4/2025 7:14 PM] Kaedues Staub
**"Well, I'm in the market? Are you selling-- or know anyone who is?"** *Kaedues asks. If these guys wanted to mug him, they could have done so a while ago.*


[1/4/2025 7:17 PM] Hector "Hect"
**"Price for this addon is steep. The hand you got alone is 46,000 micros. This grapple is 32,000. This hand syncs with most smart weapons seamlessly."**


[1/4/2025 7:17 PM] Luke
**"Trust me when I say smart weapon integration is unlike kinetic weapon junk."*** He would shift his weight from one leg to the other.


[1/4/2025 7:32 PM] Kaedues Staub
**"...I can't lie, that is a lot of micros. I have never had that much."**
*Kaedues closes his eyes and thinks. Something tells him he ought to get this kind of technology.*

**"Is there any kind of work I could do for you to knock down the price some amount?"** *Kaedues asks.*


[1/4/2025 7:37 PM] Hector "Hect"
**"Got no work I need done... Luke?"**

[1/4/2025 7:39 PM] Luke
**"You don't strike me as the bounty huntin' type. No offense. If there is work, its going to be dirty work if that."** He'd reach into his jacket and pull out what looks to be a cigar.


[1/4/2025 7:44 PM] Kaedues Staub
**"Mm,"** *Kaedues acknowledges the guy.* **"Bounty hunting. Never met one, personally. --well."** *He says, correcting himself without even mentioning it. He makes eye contact with Luke now.* **"You mind a question, the personal kind?"**


[1/4/2025 7:47 PM] Luke
He'd take his cybernetic hand and snap against the tip of his cigar, causing a spark and igniting his tobacco. Smoke began to lazily drift. **"Shoot for the stars."**

*As Kaedues asks, he steps toward his hand and picks it up.*


[1/4/2025 7:51 PM] Luke
**"None... Bounties aren't there to be 'mindful' of one's feelings. If they are paying, I am shootin'  It's how the game is played. Don't like the rules, don't play the game."**


[1/4/2025 7:56 PM] Kaedues Staub
*Now Kaedues rolls his eyes. Even he knows what a bounty is.* **"Right."** *Kaedues intuitively repeats the process Hector took to remove Kaedues' hand in reverse order. The hand returns to his wrist socket.*

**"One last thing. If you two don't have work, do you know anyone that does?"**


[1/4/2025 8:02 PM] Luke
**"You're in the Metro, plenty of work to be done. But if you're looking for honest work, take your ass back to the surface, kid."** He'd push off from the counter. **"I'll be back for my ammo in the morning."**


[1/4/2025 8:03 PM] Hector "Hect"
**"Alright."** His head would follow Luke as he sauntered off.


[1/4/2025 8:09 PM] Kaedues Staub

*He moves further into the metro, then. At least, he will if Hector won't stop him.*

[1/5/2025 11:56 PM] Narration
**"Hey you, red-headed choom!"** A woman sitting on a nearby bench called out to him, her voice rising above the ambient sounds of the 'Metro'. With a playful wave, she tried to catch his eye, hoping to draw him into a moment of conversation.


[1/6/2025 12:10 AM] Kaedues Staub
*Kaedues looks over to her. He does walk over, and attempts to get a read on her if possible. Outfit, and especially facial expression.*

*He waits for her to continue. He'd initiate conversation if she didn't before the moment got awkward though.*


[1/6/2025 12:16 AM] Narration
The woman's outfit was mostly hidden by her overcoat, covering her thighs and up up. She wore a fitted, non-brimmed hat with an elastic quality, with her raven hair pulled back into a tight ponytail. Below her thighs, she had on latex bottoms paired with shin-high boots. She was in her early to mid-twenties but didn't look 'rough' like everyone else he had seen down here so far.

**"I heard you chattin' with that vendor over there. Since you’re fresh to the Metro, I could use someone like you... One-time thing... I-I'll pay."** She went on to clarify.

**"A friend of min-."** She'd close her eyes and press her lips into a thin, forceful line. She had rehearsed this line repeatedly, but when it came down to it, she couldn't stand lying. She reset herself and opened her eyes. ** "My husband has been hiding something from me; I know it... Or, at least, I have a good reason to suspect that he is. Whenever I get close, he plays it off so smoothly... He has me geo-chipped, so I can't get close!"**

**"It's a bit dumb, I know. Everyone I asked always gave me the same static, but they weren't willing to dive into the actual trail. Could you, maybe, check it and find out if he’s for real doing something unfaithful? All I’m really looking for is some solid closure. Please?"**


[1/6/2025 12:29 AM] Kaedues Staub
**"... This is work I can do. I need more details, though."** *Kaedues lets that sit in the air for a bit.*
*He answers rather quickly. The way she speaks, and the way she dresses, concealed as she may be, make sense enough.*


[1/6/2025 12:51 AM] Narration
**"He works at Reloaded Fusion, which is a few pathways down. He has short brown hair and a cybernetic eye that is purple. His name is Xavier."** She would share random details as if she never expected to converse this far with anyone regarding the situation.


[1/6/2025 12:54 AM] Kaedues Staub
**"..... When did your relationship begin?"** *He moves on to ask.* **"How long ago did you first suspect him?"**


[1/6/2025 1:15 AM] Narration
**"We've known each other since childhood and started dating three years ago, getting married last year. Lately, he's been acting strangely. A month or so now."**


[1/6/2025 1:19 AM] Kaedues Staub
**"Are you decent beneath that coat?"** *Kaedues asks. The follow up question need not even be spoken. He points at her disguise, his facial expression perfectly portraying his indifference.*


[1/6/2025 1:34 AM] Narration
**"I'm sorry?"** She asked incredulously. Not knowing what he could possibly mean by that question.


[1/6/2025 1:37 AM] Kaedues Staub
*Kaedues gives a nod to the woman.*
**"You're disguised. Believe it or not, there is a lot to tell about a person based on the clothes they wear. Unless there's nothing under, I want a look."**

*If this guy is a street pervert, he isn't very good at it. Or maybe he is, if it gets her to open the coat.*


[1/6/2025 1:38 AM] Kaedues Staub
**"You don't need to take it off. Just show me your shirt."**


[1/6/2025 1:52 AM] Narration
The woman was cautious of Kaedues. His reasoning was unusual, but she was desperate for help. She carefully undid the drawstring on her overcoat and pulled the sides away from her body.

Underneath, she wore a loose sweater with a slightly wide neck. Barely visible spaghetti straps appeared and disappeared around her shoulders, likely her bra straps.

The sweater was solid green and had a thick black stripe vertically down her right side.

The sweater went down and past her rear. It is relatively modest for women these days.


[1/6/2025 12:09 PM] Kaedues Staub
*Kaedues makes a choice not to allow his gaze to linger. After just a brief moment, he nods.* **"You're good. Cover up."**

*He closes one eye, making an attempt to visualize the woman's situation. He crosses his arms, and rests his chin on his left hand.*
*--Actually, the coldness threatens to take Kaedues out of his flowstate. He switches hands.*
*(She looks like someone from __Littleton__. Unless she is a psychopath, the natural tics she has been letting off during this conversation lead me to believe she is being honest.)*

*Living in Littleton is a different kind of struggle. One some would argue is easier, but to Kaedues it is marginal. She may have better clothes and the opportunity to marry, but she will always live in poverty like he does.*
*(I am stressing her out. I need as much information as I can get, but lingering too long or asking the wrong questions will lead to her disengaging from my service.)*

**"You mentioned you had reason for suspecting him. Is this something you can prove to me, or is it a feeling you got from something he said or did?"**


[1/9/2025 9:45 PM] Narration
**"He's been getting home late, which isn't like him. He tries to pin it on the lockdown, but I doubt that—this started well before. His stories don't make sense when he lies."** She informed Kaedues.


[1/9/2025 9:48 PM] Kaedues Staub
**"..How much later? Hours?"** *Kaedues asks. His eyes still appear indifferent but bore themselves into the woman's eyes anyway.*


[1/9/2025 9:50 PM] Narration
**"Hours."** She didn't seem bothered by the indifference in his gaze. **"Often, he is combative when I bring my concerns to his attention."**


[1/9/2025 9:58 PM] Kaedues Staub
**"Okay. Let's talk pricing."** *Kaedues pockets his hands.* **"Considering the way I will be approaching this.. I'll accept 1,000 micros to complete the job."**
*(Is this job dangerous enough to warrant a down payment? I'm not sure.)*


[1/9/2025 10:39 PM] Narration
She considered it. At first, there was a wince at the steep pricing. Especially for someone from Littleton, 1,000 micros was more than rent... Twice over in some locations. But was it worth it? If they had a shared account, maybe she'll pull it from there? **"...Can I trust you?"** She asked.


[1/9/2025 10:52 PM] Kaedues Staub
*Kaedues notices her hesitation.*
*`("You can trust that I need the money.")` The reply appears in his head... and he dismisses it. The reason why slips his mind.*
**"..I think it is fair to say.. that I need you to trust me,"** *Kaedues says. He breaks eye contact for a fleeting moment. His mouth opens, then closes, as if he were about to say something.*


[1/9/2025 10:57 PM] Narration
These words were sufficient. After a few more moments of thought. Kaedues saw 1,000 micros wire into his account. **"..."** She deflated a bit, knowing that what she did would have massive repercussions. But in her eyes, this was a necessary evil.


[1/9/2025 11:11 PM] Kaedues Staub
*500 of the micros are transferred back. He did it before he figured out how to explain himself.*

*....*

**"Pay me the rest later."** *Kaedues says after the pause.* **"I won't shark you... but don't make me regret that."**
*Without another moment, he looks further into the metro. She said it was a few pathways down.. so it shouldn't be too long of a walk.*


[1/10/2025 12:25 AM] Narration
The Metro upon further inspection was filled with motion. Not many food vendors resided in these tunnels, but a bite to eat was available if so chosen.

Many stores were selling weapons of many variations, sizes, and makes. From kinetic weapons to the occasional plasma rifle that has been smuggled in. 

The constant rain that batters the surface had worked its way to the ceiling of the tunnels. Frequent leaks could be seen.

In the direction, Kaedues was looking off too was a set of vendors selling shards and another trying to convince people to install jail broken cybernetics. In addition, it split into two separate tunnels. Both symmetrical in design and content... Left of Right?


[1/10/2025 12:34 AM] Kaedues Staub
*Kaedues happened to be travelling on the left side, so he continues left. On his way, he does notice the stores. If he wanted to get his hands on a weapon, he could come back here later. Or sooner.. hopefully later.*

*His footsteps are drowned out by the hustle and bustle.*


[1/10/2025 12:46 AM] Narration
**"These Vesperian Legionnaires, who the deck are they anyway? I thought the CCR was the top dog around here."**

**"I guess not. I've seen fewer and fewer CCR patrols replaced with these monsters. Have you seen the large suits they pilot? Those things are weapons of war."**

**"With the way Haven Heights is, I'd consider it a warzone."**
This was idle chatter that Kaedues walked past.

**"Those thugs hung a girl last night... First, it was gang violence and theft. Now, innocent children are targets."**

**"This District is going to shit. It's impossible to save enough micros to afford a ride to District 10 or 8. It's like they don't want us to leave with these fares."**

Another conversation came up.


[1/10/2025 12:54 AM] Kaedues Staub
*Kaedues' pace slows as he hears some of the conversations.....*


[1/10/2025 12:54 AM] Kaedues Staub឵
*`The people affected are outside the scope of people I would let employ me.`*


[1/10/2025 12:54 AM] Kaedues Staub
*(..No, that's not it. I just don't have a reason to butt into those peoples' business.)*

*Kaedues continues to walk. Something they said occupies Kaedues as he walks. He thinks they said something out of place.. but can't point a finger at exactly what. Did they not just say it? Why not speak?*


[1/10/2025 12:59 AM] Narration
**"The Steel Titan has been making rounds in Haven Heights... Did you see that blast last night? Whoever they zeroed are no longer existent, I can tell you that."**

**"Matters not to me, as long as I get paid. Anyone can get vaporized for all that I care for."**

Kaedues was on the right path as a large store with the name the woman mentioned was just up ahead...


[1/10/2025 1:03 AM] Kaedues Staub
*`If I waste my time listening to all of them, I'll never get the job done.`*


[1/10/2025 1:03 AM] Kaedues Staub឵
*(That's.. true.)*
*Kaedues quickens his pace and ignores that conversation. He continues towards the store. If he enters it, he'd be seen.. but that's fine. Kaedues can figure it out.*

*Before he gets too close, he takes a look at the shop's exterior.*


[1/10/2025 1:26 AM] Narration
The store was built into the side of the tunnel. Display in the front glass shown refurbished components that take Fusion Cores.

Fusion Cores were extremely valuable items that powered the most modern vehicles. They vary in size and compatibility. Providing the ability for vehicles to run without 'fuel' for more than 1000 miles.


[1/10/2025 10:38 AM] Kaedues Staub
*(My plan is to follow this person, since I have no other ways to effectively track him. First, I need to locate the man.)*

*Now he approaches the exterior, close enough for people exiting to bump into him if they weren't looking where they walked.*
*(Making an alibi that has me moving around would be a good idea.)*

*Without any further wait, he tries the door.*


[1/10/2025 9:34 PM] Narration
It was not long before someone carrying a case did just that. The guy was around the same size of frame as Kaedues which led to the man stumbling a bit. The case latches flung open and two cores toppled out and began rolling out in different directions. **"Ah, damn it... Hey, you. Haven't you gotten out of the way before?!"** He was irrate, but his question was... nonsensiscal? He began moving to catch the first one. The second one will have to come afterwards!


[1/10/2025 9:37 PM] Kaedues Staub
**"You're asking me a loaded question,"** *Kaedues says. He makes one large step towards the lone rolling core, and picks it up with one hand. He holds the device up and gives it a quick check for any visible damage.*


[1/10/2025 9:40 PM] Narration
The hull was scuffed on one end, showing where it had struck the hardened floor beneath them. The siliver like coating now revealed a dull metal texture; The damage was negligable at best. **"Yeah? Well, maybe you shouldn't be standing so damn close to the door."** He'd retort as he scooped one up and began looking for the second one. Unbeknowst to him, Kaedues had it in his hands.


[1/10/2025 9:42 PM] Kaedues Staub
**"You're looking for this?"** *He holds the core forward.*


[1/10/2025 9:43 PM] Narration
**"Yes."** He would step forward and go to grab it.


[1/10/2025 9:47 PM] Kaedues Staub
*He doesn't get in the guy's way, at least no more than he already has.*
*(It's clearly an overreaction. The stress levels of the people down here.. no, in Haven Heights, is worsening. Did so much really happen while I `was in Monita`?)*

*He shakes the thought off.*


[1/10/2025 9:49 PM] Narration
He would take the Fusion core back and do his own inspection. **"Ugh, you have no idea how hard it is to get your hands on these things nowadays. Greedy bastards..."** From there, he moved towards his case and started replacing them.


[1/10/2025 9:50 PM] Kaedues Staub
**"They make them here?"** *He'd ask.* **"Or is this spot just the cash grab?"**


[1/10/2025 9:54 PM] Narration
The guy's entire rant shifted them. **"Eh? No, they aren't 'made' here. The materials that make up the internal circuits come from  District 5. These CCR clowns get zaps on these things and whatever. This place just breaks down the components and refurbishes them."** Clicking the latches on the case. Safety first this time around.


[1/10/2025 9:55 PM] Narration
**"You're not from around here are you?"** The guy asked, now realising that these lines of questions would have came from someone who wasn't familiar with these underground streets.


[1/10/2025 9:56 PM] Kaedues Staub
**"No."** *He says plainly. Someone might expect him to become defensive, but Kaedues' tone remains neutral as ever.*


[1/10/2025 9:59 PM] Narration
**"Thought as much."** He said off-handedly. **"These things are powerhouses."** Patting the width of the case. **"Need a AV powered up? Power a district block? Deck your wheels to the point any vehicle chase results in you getting your sorry ass out alive? Go with a Fusion Core."**

**"There are a thousand other things I would rather spend money on,"** *Kaedues says. He looks past the man and lets out an exhasperated sigh. Can this thick fuck move?*


[1/10/2025 10:21 PM] Narration
**"Fuck you."** He'd get offended and push his way past Kaedues. Clearly this kid has no idea what a true masterpiece is.


[1/10/2025 10:24 PM] Kaedues Staub
*Kaedues sees the man step forward and holds himself especially sturdy. The guy should bounce off of Kaedues again, not the other way around.*

*He gives the man a hard, brief look before going to step into the store again.*

[1/10/2025 10:33 PM] Narration
The man bounced like a hockey puck on the side of the ring. **"Tsk."** He'd flip Kaedues' off before slipping into the crowd. Upon entering the store, it smelled like metal shavings, oils, and synethic fluids. Chains on cranes and acting as decoration. Engine parts, tubes, and other products lined shelves and there were a decent amount of people on the inside browsing. As Kaedues crossed the threshold, there was a armed man leaning against the inside wall. Iron strapped to his hip. No doubt security for the store.


[1/10/2025 10:39 PM] Kaedues Staub
*Kaedues skims the room with his eyes and approaches any nearby counter he can find. He notices the security guard.*
*(I need to appear ordinary...) Kaedues thinks to himself.*

*He goes over memory of the peoples he saw in the Metro. How they walked, how they talked, what their concerns were. It might not be __pressing__, but if Kaedues wants to blend in and track this Xavier guy he's going to have to `build himself a narrative`.*

*The gait of the people here isn't too much different than his own. Their way of speech, though, is different. These people speak their mind, and mind their business.*


[1/10/2025 10:45 PM] Narration
At the counter, there was a guy with his legs propped up on the top. Reclined in his seat as he watched the news. When Kaedues approached the counter, he looked up towards the man. **"Can I help you, choom?"**


[1/10/2025 10:54 PM] Kaedues Staub
**"Yeah, I think you can. I'm low on micros, choomba. Was hoping to score some work."** *Kaedues avoids eye contact and puts on an insecure expression.* **"Just enough money to buy something from westside, man."** *He grimaces at even the thought.* **"There's got to be something I can do."**


[1/10/2025 11:00 PM] Narration
The guy would hum thoughtfully, picking his nose with his pinkie finger. **"I ain't the head-hancho around here."** He stated. Then, pulling his legs off the counter, the man sat up and push himself in. **"Lookin' for work down here isn't an application process either like you'd find on the surface. Got to know people."**


[1/10/2025 11:05 PM] Kaedues Staub
**"Surface won't take me for shit, choom. Having a dry spell. You think you could at least do me the service of letting your boss turn me down?"** *He asks, and sounds sincere.*


[1/10/2025 11:24 PM] Narration
The guy rose his eyebrow, seemingly unimpressed with Kaedues' plea. Then, his attention shifted towards someone behind him? **"Oi, X, can you hurry the fuck up with the stocking? Trying to take my break here."** With that out of the way, he returned his gaze towards Kaedues. **"No can do... Now you can either browse and buy or scram."** 

The guard at the door shifting his head from one side to the other. Watching the two converse.


[1/11/2025 2:28 PM] Kaedues Staub
*(X? That could be shorthand for Xavier. Looking around and familiarizing myself with the store's inventory might be useful later.)*

*With that, Kaedues looks around the shelves. Does this store have a particular demographic?*


[1/12/2025 10:27 PM] Narration
The store's shoppers were primarily men between 20 and 50. They were a mixed bunch of folks from various walks of life (within the confines of wealth in Haven Heights, of course). As for the shelves' contents, the store offers a wide range of fasteners and tubing sections used in various automobile and aircraft configurations and models, particularly near Kaedues. A dark-skinned man knelt at one of these shelves, speaking with someone who could have been a co-worker at the store. The kneeling man's back was turned to Kaedues, but the one standing could be seen clear as day. The two were joking from the inflection in their laughter. Smoke lazily drifted around the lower man. One thing was Certain, and the one standing was __, not__, his target.


[1/12/2025 10:39 PM] Kaedues Staub
*Kaedues rubs his chin and takes a look at some of the tubing they have for sale.*

**"The van could do good with a swap out.."** *he thinks out loud. He takes note of the kneeling person. Does he have hair?*


[1/12/2025 10:42 PM] Narration
The man had short brown hair on his head.  Not a single strand of hair would be able to reach the nape of his neck as to how short it was.


[1/12/2025 10:50 PM] Kaedues Staub
*Kaedues thinks to himself for a sec, trying to come up with something reasonable to say. After a pause..*

*.. He approaches the couple guys. He doesn't wave, but he does relax his brow and jaw to look confused, maybe lost.*

**"Hey. Do either of you know if this shop sells spark plugs?"** *He asks. Kaedues hadn't seen any yet, but that's fine. All he needs is an answer.*


[1/13/2025 6:20 PM] Narration
The guy standing shifted his attention from his partner towards Kaedues. **"Uh.."** The man kneeling finally turned a quarter of the ways towards Kaedues, a purple ring around his iris illuminated and pulsed as he regarded him. **"Aisle 3."**

[1/13/2025 6:48 PM] Kaedues Staub
*Kaedues nods.* **"Thank fuck."** *Kaedues moves away from the couple of guys and walks down the third aisle. He does look for the spark plugs, but doesn't find the particular make of plug for his van.* **"Ugh.."**

*Now, he just moves to leave the store. No spark plugs, no reason to buy them. Internally, he is relieved to not be wasting any money.*


[1/13/2025 7:00 PM] Narration
The two men went back to their regular scheduled program. Now oblivious of what Kaedues may be or do while the security guard was nowhere to be seen. Must have stepped out for the time being or something.


[1/13/2025 7:18 PM] Kaedues Staub
*Kaedues leaves the store and notes the absence of the security guard. When he returns to the overtly large labyrinthine tunnels, he takes a brief look at the shop's surroundings again.*

*He's looking for hiding spots now. Particularly, one of two ideal locations come to mind...*
- *A hiding spot that is difficult to see, like the space behind a support pillar or some such would be useful. If no one sees him, then he has nothing to worry about. However, hiding in places like this is suspicious.*
- *A hiding spot that is blatant, but inconspicuous, like a bench could also be useful. Being seen by Xavier on his way out could be touchy. However, being seen would no longer appear suspicious.. __especially__ since the people here seem to mind their business.*


[1/13/2025 7:24 PM] Narration
Two of those things were actually available. Not even 10 meters away was a pillar supporting a more larger commons area. Almost like a food court, with only a few select options. Beyond the pillar was a table with no one seated at it. Perfect for someone who wants to isolate themselves...


[1/13/2025 7:35 PM] Kaedues Staub
*Kaedues had preferred the latter option after thinking about it. Since the people of the Metro mind their business, it is at least __less likely__ that he'd be stopped at the table.*

*Kaedues approaches the empty table and sits at it. If possible, he chooses a seat with an indirect sightline of the shop. Once he is situated, Kaedues places his elbows on the table and crosses his fingers. He rests his chin upon his hands, fingers laced together, and allows his eyes to unfocus just slightly.*

*Now... he waits. In a position like this, Kaedues could wait for hours without expending energy. Movements of passersby will stir him from the trance, and of course, he is keeping his attention focused on that shop. If Xavier leaves, Kaedues will see it.*


[1/13/2025 8:18 PM] Ghost
*The metro. A place Ghost knew all too well. Over the course of his career, it had become his hidden gem—his go-to spot. Anything he needed, he could get here. Weapons, gadgets, cybernetics, you name it.*

*He moved through the station, his steps slow and deliberate, taking in his surroundings. His gaze swept left and right as he made his way to his destination. But then, he came to an **abrupt stop.** His instincts kicked in. He paused, waiting just a beat longer than usual. His trusty handgun rested in its holster on his right, and the other—acquired from Paige during the raid—hung on his opposite side.*

*The hum of the metro filled the air as people passed by, some brushing past him, others lost in their own world. Ghost remained still, scanning. __He shifted his focus__, first to his left, then **right**, then a bit further **right**—until his eyes locked on someone.*

***A figure with red hair.***

*Initially, that figure makes no reaction to Ghost's presence. It does not move, does not flinch, and perhaps does not even think. There is an especially cold silence coming from it. Is it thoughtless? Or is it just oblivious to the armed gunman that approached?*

*To say it did not move would actually appear to be even more accurate as a lasting moment passes. There is __absolutely no movement at all__ from this person. His weathered jumpsuit appears particularly out of place for Haven Heights-- this isn't casual or comfort wear, and especially not brand-name clothing.*
*His red hair also could stand out. The particular pigment of red this figure possesses is __not__ any kind Ghostgaze could have come across in all of his years as a bounty hunter. The dim overhead lights crash against his head of hair, and it produces a bronze shine unlike natural oils.*

*After even longer, just before the bounty hunter's attention could wear away, that figure's eyes-- and solely its eyes-- peel toward him. Before he even realized it, they were looking at one another. It could have happened while Ghost blinked.*

[1/13/2025 8:46 PM] Ghost
*Ghost noted the exchange. He had a feeling that he knew this person, but it was just a feeling at the end of the day. He then slowly turned his head forward, **almost deliberately.***


[1/13/2025 8:56 PM] Kaedues Staub
*This was one of the aforementioned moments where his trance would break. The idea that it could mean something one way or another is completely withheld from the man. He watches the masked stranger's head turn away from him, and he decides to move forward from there.*

*His eyes roll back into neutral position, and he continues to wait. It would take him a few minutes to retrance himself.*


[1/13/2025 8:58 PM] Luke
**"Well if it isn't my old time pal..."** It was Luke, strutting up through the throng of patrons and guests alike. His thumbs jammed between his trousers and belt. An amused expression upon his features. **"What brings your sorry ass all the way down here?"** He was approaching Ghost.


[1/13/2025 9:03 PM] Ghost
*He recognized that voice instantly. It was none other than Luke **Fucking** Nasty Lonestar, a fellow bounty hunter Ghost had crossed paths with some time ago. And not in the __best__ of situations either.*

`. . .`

*Ghost moved past him, his shoulder brushing against Luke with force—though not intentionally, given the large crowd surrounding them. He had __no interest__ in small talk.*

[1/13/2025 9:06 PM] Luke
**"He he he he he."** He'd chuckle as Ghost brushed past him. **"That ain't no way to treat a friend, __Cole Mercer__."** His tone flattened with his name now mentioned outloud.


[1/13/2025 9:08 PM] Ghost
*He came to a sudden stop, slowly turning around. His large frame loomed closer and closer to Luke, until he was close enough to look down on him. It seemed Luke had finally found a way to get his attention.*

**What was his next move?**


[1/13/2025 9:11 PM] Luke
Luke looked up towards Ghost without a single moment of hesitation. Got him, right where he wanted him in fact... **"That's right... Look at me when I talk to you, Cole."** The serious gaze broke after a second, that same amused grin resurfaced. **"You're a wanted man..."** He'd hand him a shard for him to slot.


[1/13/2025 9:14 PM] Ghost
*Ghost exhaled sharply, his breath heavy with focus. His hands clenched into fists, muscles taut, but he held his ground—**no room for rash moves, not here.***

*His eyes never left Luke's, a cold intensity cutting through the air. **Without** a word, **without** breaking that stare, he jammed the shard into the slot, the motion swift, controlled, and __**final**__.*


[1/13/2025 9:19 PM] Narration
Cole's wanted profile populated his eyes. 603,000 Micros was the bounty on his head. Wanted **DEAD**.


[1/13/2025 9:19 PM] Luke
**"An awful alot of micros if you ask me... Know what they say, it's easier to kill a target than to drag'em alive and kick.."** Luke rolled his tongue in his mouth a few times, his jaw shifting left and right before closing.


[1/13/2025 9:19 PM] Luke
**"Lucky day for you that I found you in the Metro and not out there..."**


[1/13/2025 9:21 PM] Luke
**"Can't cause a scene and bite the hand that feeds you. Lucky lucky..."** 
-#  "mercer..."


[1/13/2025 9:22 PM] Luke
**"Heh... Take care of yourself now."** He'd pat Cole on the shoulder before continuing on his way like they were best of friends. Not once did Luke look back towards him.


[1/13/2025 9:27 PM] Ghost
*He knew better than to react to Luke’s antics. Cole processed the information, his mind working in silence before he muttered, coldly,* 
-# **"Sleep well while you still can, Luke."**

*He turned and began making his way to his destination.*


[1/13/2025 9:28 PM] Kaedues Staub
*Kaedues takes a mental note of that exchange.*


[1/13/2025 9:35 PM] Narration
Just when the two seperated, the 'X' Guy emerged from the store he worked at with his friend still in tow...


[1/13/2025 9:39 PM] Narration
With Luke now out of the way, Ghost was now well on his way to Hector's shop. All he had to do is approach!


[1/13/2025 9:41 PM] Kaedues Staub
*Kaedues keeps his neutral face and watches the man he presumes to be Xavier. That's good timing.*


[1/21/2025 8:25 PM] Narration
From Kaedues' point of view, he could clearly see the two men stop at the front of the store. The guy with Xavier seemed like he was gearing up to leave, while Xavier was exchanging last words with him. 

The occasional passerby would obscure Kaedues' direct line of sight, creating a shutter-like movement between the two. Then, right when the immediate cluster of people have passed, he could see the tail end of what appeared to be Xavier giving his friend a kiss. But now, they were going their seperate ways...


[1/21/2025 8:33 PM] Narration
Xavier returned inside the store while his little lover-friend was going in the general direction Kaedues was positioned.


[1/21/2025 8:40 PM] Kaedues Staub
*For a fleeting moment, Kaedues closes his eyes and thinks. A direct approach is both suspicious and ineffective. To get confirmation, he'd have to try the indirect approach. He stands up and jogs toward Xavier's lover! His hand raises up as a gesture that he's trying to flag the guy down.*

**"Hey, hang a sec would ya?"** *He asks, his voice risen but not shouting. In the meantime, he begins to record his surroundings' audio.*


[1/21/2025 8:53 PM] Narration
The man didn't realize Kaedues was speaking with him initially until he looked around and saw that the red-haired man in question was moving towards him. **"Didn't I see you a few bleeps ago?"** He inquired, his hands deep within his jacket pockets.


[1/21/2025 8:59 PM] Kaedues Staub
**"Yeah, that was me,"** *Kaedues says. He approaches his target, but never intends to get particularly close-- just far enough away to reliably record the thing. His walking slows down as he reaches a distance of around 12 feet.*

*(There are a few __social engineering__ questions I could ask if I want him to spill the beans. I need to make sure to be indirect.)*

**"..Please don't get the wrong idea,"** *Kaedues pivots his head due left a bit and down. His eyes sparsely flicker to and away from the man, and his shoulders loosen.* **"but I saw you when you came out just now. Need some advice, that's all."** *By adding a hitch in his voice, he portrays someone who is nervous or anxious.*


[1/21/2025 9:04 PM] Narration
**"Eh?"** The guy straightened his posture and tilted his head up. **"I'm not much for advice, choom. What kind of advice are you after anyway?"**


[1/21/2025 9:12 PM] Kaedues Staub
*(For 'me', the idea of approaching a stranger and asking for advice is a last resort. 'I' am unfamiliar with 'my' own feelings, and need a second opinion.)*

*Kaedues hesitates to speak for a lingering moment, but does pipe up.* **"Look.. I got a friend I want to.. well, I like him."** *Kaedues' eyebrows scrunch together in an attempt to tell the man he did not like admitting that.*
**"I think I need to ask him, you 'load? Don't know how..."** *He exhales very slowly.* **"Not asking for a coach or mentor, choom. Just want to know how.. the two of you started off."** *He drags his eyes to meet this man again.*


[1/21/2025 9:21 PM] Narration
He was uncomfortable. Shifting his balance around as he glanced around with a sigh.**"It wasn't much, really. We are co-workers, so we just got talking and one thing led to another is all..."**


[1/21/2025 9:38 PM] Kaedues Staub
*(He's looking for a way out of the conversation. If I had to guess, he is talking only out of principle. He would feel guilty to leave.)*

*Kaedues thinks about his options moving forward. A part of him feels like this could be easier, somehow..*
*(To ask him another question wil make him feel like he is being interrogated. I should say something simple, and try prompting him to respond.)*

**"It's a good thing, choomba. A lucky break for someone around here."** *He breathes out.* **"Don't want to keep you. I hope things between you and.."** *Kaedues turns his head to look at the store Xavier works at. His mouth hangs ajar, and his eyebrows furrow just a little.*


[1/21/2025 10:01 PM] Narration
**"Xavier."** He'd finish for him! Seeing as this was a natural thing for him to respond to!


[1/21/2025 10:03 PM] Kaedues Staub
**"--Xavier,"** *He says, turning back to the man.* **"Thanks. For your time, too."**

*Kaedues takes a step backwards, pauses, and then turns to leave the man on his lonesome. He stops the audio recording and, if not interrupted, will walk back to the woman he saw near Metro's entrance.*


[1/21/2025 10:38 PM] Narration
Kaedues moved back to where the woman sat uninterrupted. On his approach, he could see the young lady look around expectingly. Nervous to receive the resolution she had been seeking for what felt like eons. Or expecting that Kaedues would flake on her, running off with the money she entrusted in him. She held her jacket closed physically with her hands, a coping mechanism to provide herself comfort...


[1/21/2025 10:47 PM] Kaedues Staub
*Kaedues approaches the woman. His boots clammer against the solid ground but the sound is lost to the crowds behind. His eyes glue to her.*
**"I have answers."**


[1/21/2025 10:56 PM] Narration
His voice pulled her attention. The woman's head turned quickly, and there was a flash of a smile before it dropped. She remembered that she should be anxious about him returning, whether it was good news or not. **"A-answers? What did you find?"** She asked, scooting closer to the edge of the seat she occupied.


[1/21/2025 11:03 PM] Kaedues Staub
**"That your suspicions are true. Your husband is involved with someone else. A coworker, male."**
*Kaedues' posture has returned to its healthy, ordinary state it is usually in. He stands tall. Something about the way he answered her just now though.. it irks him.*

*(Shouldn't I be careful when talking about matters like this? This is sensitive.)*
**"I saw him kiss the man on his way out. I flagged that person down and recorded a brief conversation that more or less confirms this to be true."**


[1/21/2025 11:08 PM] Narration
The woman's brows pinched together tightly, her face showing obvious distress. There's a few tears, a few sniffles, and a lot of heartbreak in the look she gives Kaedues. **"Can you... play the recording? I need to hear it for myself."** She asked, wiping the tears from her face.


[1/21/2025 11:14 PM] Kaedues Staub
*Kaedues blinks. A panging sensation urging him to move echoes through his head. It's not necessary.. but..*


[1/21/2025 11:14 PM] Kaedues Staub឵
**`"..Yeah."`**
*`Kaedues opts to sit down next to her instead of standing over her. He presses two fingers to his temple and looks over at the woman, beaming the audio recording to her.`*

*`He cannot actually bring himself to look her in the eye while the recording plays. Despite the hustle and bustle of the surrounding area, Kaedues finds that there's an amount of quiet he isn't comfortable with.`*


[1/21/2025 11:21 PM] Narration
The woman is silent throughout the recording. When the recording finishes, and the two of them are just there. Not a word, not a muscle twiched... She looks down at Kaedues' feet, unmoving...


[1/21/2025 11:33 PM] Kaedues Staub
*`The silence reaches further out to Kaedues. It summons something unfamiliar, something... something intrusive, like the stone dropped into a bowl full of water that causes it to spill over.`*

*`The man's lips open, and then close.. and open again. He stutters, hesitates to begin speaking. From somewhere that feels like his stomach, or maybe his chest.. he feels a compelling. To act, to talk? To what?`*

**`"What is your name?"`** *` he hears himself ask. As the words come out of his mouth, Kaedues finds himself wondering why he asked at all.`*


[1/21/2025 11:37 PM] Narration
**"Noelle.."** She said, after a few moments. **"It's Noelle."** Her voice sounded so sad, so fragile.


[1/21/2025 11:51 PM] Kaedues Staub
*`The red-haired man pauses for a while. It is not his intention to linger, to wait so long, but there is no order to his actions now. No predetermined response to check off the list.`*

*`He stands up slowly and turns to face Noelle, holding the same standing position he had earlier.`*
**`"Call this number if rent money falls through."`** *`Kaedues' number is sent over to her.`*

-# *`"Bounties aren't there to be 'mindful' of one's feelings."`*
*`The memory happens across Kaedues as he turns to leave the Metro where he came in from.`*


[1/22/2025 12:01 AM] Narration
She watched he leaves her heart aching as her own world crumbles to dust around her. The one person who had been her world for years was the one who broke her. The number that Kaedues left her with was his own. He went out of his way to say all of that? It was so sweet of him. She looked over the number, a pained smile as she stared at it in her vision, before she put it into her contacts under the name *"Red."*

One hand rested upon her stomach, which was not exactly showing her pregnancy yet... But she knew she needed to do something. With this new found knowledge, she could take measures ahead of time.


[1/22/2025 9:24 PM] Narration
Kaedues continuing @ https://discord.com/channels/1106367747727835206/1107821899649646717/1331734332087341077


[1/22/2025 9:30 PM] Narration
Ghostgaze reached Hector's shop without further interruptions. At the counter, Hector was lazily browsing a digital catalog on his datapad. Oblivious to Ghost's appearance until he neared.


[1/22/2025 9:30 PM] Hector "Hect"
**"I wondered if you got zeroed out there. But word gets around down here."** He remarked as he regarding Ghost with his full undivided attention.


[1/22/2025 9:33 PM] Ghost
*Although it had been a while since his last order, Ghost didn’t care. He had already paid for what he needed. Without wasting a second, he cut straight to the point.* 

**“Where is it?”**


[1/22/2025 9:36 PM] Hector "Hect"
**"In with the unclaimed merchandise in the back."** He took two steps back before moving towards the back of the shop.


[1/22/2025 9:37 PM] Ghost
*Ghost waited idly, unbothered despite the earlier threat. Patience was second nature to him.*


[1/22/2025 9:38 PM] Cat Bayes
**"Yo!"** *A familiar voice piped up from behind Ghostgaze. In comes the annoyance that plagued his existence, Cat.* **"You about wrapped up here? Kode was checkin' in on us earlier."**


[1/22/2025 9:39 PM] Ghost
*Ghost briefly turned his head toward Cat, then back in the direction Hector had disappeared. He didn’t say a word... **just stood there**, waiting in silence.*


[1/22/2025 9:43 PM] Cat Bayes
**"...Mmh."** *Yeah, that's about what she expected from the psychopath. Clicking her tongue, she made her way beside him as she held her hands behind her back, leaning back and forth on her feet.* **"Sooo, what'cha buy?"**


[1/22/2025 9:46 PM] Ghost
*Ghost remained silent, not out of spite, but simply because talking wasn’t his way, **especially not here**, in the Metro. Instead, he let out a low grunt, dismissive. To him, the question wasn’t significant enough to answer.*


[1/22/2025 9:49 PM] Hector "Hect"
He returned with the items Ghost had ordered, laying it all out on the table. **"Ten grenades, ten smoke grenades and an ice pick."**


[1/22/2025 9:49 PM] Narration
The grenades came in boxes, just as he ordered!


[1/22/2025 9:50 PM] Cat Bayes
**"You bought a-"** *Her eyes widened for a moment, glancing down at the ice pick for a moment. She remembered that deadly piece of climbing equipment from the brawl he and Paige had atop the car that one time. She gave him a side eye.* **"You really didn't like losing that thing, huh."**


[1/22/2025 9:54 PM] Ghost
*Ghost ignored Cat, focusing instead on the items before him. After a brief scan, he nodded in satisfaction. He then turned his gaze to Hector, asking bluntly,* **"Do you have a duffle bag?"**


[1/22/2025 9:55 PM] Hector "Hect"
He kept his eyes on Ghost. He leaned down and pulled a duffle bag from underneath the counter.


[1/22/2025 9:56 PM] Hector "Hect"
**"20."** He'd state the price...


[1/22/2025 10:01 PM] Ghost
*Ghost transferred the funds without delay, then began packing his items into the duffle bag. As he reached for the ice pick, he took a moment to inspect it closely. His fingers traced the sharp edges with precision, a small, calculated motion. Satisfied, he holstered it securely. After zipping up the bag and slinging it over his shoulder, he paused, his gaze shifting back to Hector.*

*Before turning to leave, he asked one last thing...*

**"Any idea where I can find something like my old mask?"**

**"If you can persuade him to pay back... I don't know, 4% of what he owes. Then I'll have him do you a solid and make you one."**


[1/22/2025 10:12 PM] Ghost
*Hector was right, but adjusting to this new life wasn’t easy. Ghost was taking small steps, but with a bounty on his head, every move was more complicated.*

*He briefly glanced down at the counter, lost in thought, his mind processing Hector's words. The message was clear.*

*Without hesitation, Ghost looked up and said,* **"His location."**


[1/22/2025 10:16 PM] Hector "Hect"
**"Hard to get to if you don't got a way in. Fairview, Yuston Apartments. Room 51. Across the street from a company storefront for UrbanFlex. Name is Freddie Dawson. Owes the __metro__ a LOT of micros."** He tapped his fingers on the counter. **"I know a way into Fairview from the Metro, if you take this small errand, of course."**

[1/22/2025 10:18 PM] Cat Bayes
*Freddie __Dawson__? That name sounded familiar to Cat...wait. Didn't Kode and Paige mention the Dawsons when they were talking about the old Horizon Grey members? He couldn't be talking about __that__ Freddie, could he?*


[1/22/2025 10:23 PM] Ghost
*Ghost processed the information, his mind running through the details. Paige had mentioned that name before, though he hadn’t been there to catch it. Getting to Fairview now presented new challenges, but backing down was never his style—especially with the stakes so high. A bounty on his head meant he needed **all** the resources he could gather.*

**“Proceed.”** *he said, his voice steady, offering no hint of hesitation.*


[1/22/2025 10:28 PM] Hector "Hect"
**"There is an abandoned tunnel on the Northwest side of the Metro. It will take you to a stream where outbound waste-water heading for Monita goes. Bypasses Kapea completely."** Ghost's deck would update. **"See if he's home, if he is, great, ask him nicely about the payment. You can scare him easily, I am sure. Demand that mask and he'll fold. Getting that 4% payment would set me and you square and I'll give you a discount on all my tech."**


[1/22/2025 10:32 PM] Ghost
*Ghost took in the information, processing it carefully. His face remained stoic behind the mask, not a hint of emotion betraying his thoughts. The deal was laid out clearly, but he knew well that nothing came without a cost, and he had no qualms about paying what was required for a solid lead.*

**"Understood."** *His voice was low, cold, and matter-of-fact, just like his approach to everything.*


[1/22/2025 10:33 PM] Ghost
*He turned around, finally facing Cat. His gaze lingered on her for a brief moment, the silence hanging in the air, almost __uncomfortable__. Was he about to say something? It was unclear. Without a word, he moved past her and left the store, heading back to the new hideout.*


[1/22/2025 10:34 PM] Cat Bayes
**"Uh..."** *Cat looked like she was about to say something to get Ghost's attention, but was cut off by him rudely walking past her instead. Directing her attention back to Hector, she coughed and gave the man an awkward wave before sloooowwwwly making her way to the exit.* **"Thanks for the helllppppp."** *Smooth, Cat.*


[1/22/2025 10:37 PM] Hector "Hect"
He just watched Cat as she left before going about his own devices. **"Hmph. Not bad."**


[1/22/2025 10:39 PM] Ghost
*As Ghost made his way to the maintenance tunnels, his steps **quickened.** It seemed he was in a... hurry?*


[1/22/2025 10:40 PM] Cat Bayes
**"Hey, wait up!"** *Cat had to break out into a light jog to catch up to Ghost, finally meeting his pace and looking his way once she did.* **"What's got you in such a hurry?"**

Cat and Cole on their way back


[1/22/2025 10:42 PM] Ghost
*Ghost glanced left and right, scanning for any signs of being followed. His tone was cold and blunt as he spoke.*

**"Bounty on my head. __Stay out of the way.__"**


[1/22/2025 10:46 PM] Cat Bayes
**"Well technically, I'm to the side, so-"** *Nope, Cat, stop that sentence right there. This isn't Paige you're talking to, stop being a wise ass.*

**"Look, wouldn't it be faster if I at least helped?"** *Maybe she could get to know the man a little better if they went on a mission together? In all honesty, she kinda just wanted him to stop staring daggers at her everytime she came into his vicinity.*


[1/22/2025 10:47 PM] Cat Bayes
**"I could drive you there!"**


[1/22/2025 10:50 PM] Ghost
*Ghost paused for a moment, the offer running through his mind. He shook his head, dismissing it as quickly as it came. Drive him there? **Was she trying to get him killed?** He exhaled sharply, hastening his pace without a word. Silence enveloped him as he focused on reaching the tunnels, his mind set on the task.*


[1/22/2025 10:52 PM] Cat Bayes
*You know that saying: Silence speaks volumes? Yeah, he was wearing that fucking phrase like a god damned mascot.*

*Softly groaning, she once again broke into a jog and followed him back, sharing in the quietness.*

[2/10/2025 11:09 PM] Narration
Kaedues entered the metro from the same staircase. Not much has changed down here. In fact, the only change that could be fathomed was the different people. 

Hector was off to Kaedues once he stepped into the repurposed subway network. He was busy stocking his front row items. Waiting for a customer to come.


[2/11/2025 12:59 AM] Kaedues Staub
*Kaedues walks up to Hector as he stocks his items. He clears his throat and speaks up:*
**"Hey. Mind if I flash you a question?"** *he asks plainly. Kaedues' eyes scan Hector's face, and especially his sunglasses.. but he can't see through them.*


[2/11/2025 10:33 PM] Hector "Hect"
The young man was crouched down towards the bottom of the display when Kaedues inquired if he could ask his question, which prompted Hector to turn his head in the direction of Kaedues. **"I thought that was a familiar voice."** He remarked before placing his hands on his knees, standing upright, and then making his way towards the counter. 

Hector smiled slightly, showing complacent in receiving Kaedues' company, although it may be brief. Once at the counter, he placed his palms on the cool steel-like surface before shifting his posture where he was most comfortable. **"Flash away."**


[2/11/2025 10:42 PM] Kaedues Staub
**"You know anyone who's been around down here? Need to find a certain kind of person. Anyone who's familiar with the layout."**
*Kaedues pushes his elbows out in a stretch. After a brief moment of that, he returns to his plain-suited posture.*


[2/11/2025 10:56 PM] Hector "Hect"
**"Lots of chooms 'been around,' but getting anyone to give you a tour is another gig."**Tapping his fingers against the surface. **"Got me wonderin' why you itchin' to get the lay of the network."**


[2/11/2025 11:03 PM] Kaedues Staub
**"You seen the borders around here, choom?"** *Kaedues asks plainly.*
*(Hope he doesn't make this difficult for me,) Kaedues finds himself thinking.*


[2/11/2025 11:14 PM] Hector "Hect"
**"You mean the one that separates our community and __theirs__?"** He inquired for context.


[2/11/2025 11:23 PM] Kaedues Staub
*Kaedues nods his head.* **"Yeah,"** *he responds, and then adds,* **"one of them."**


[2/11/2025 11:33 PM] Hector "Hect"
**"Then yes, yes I have. These so-called Vesperian Legionnaires have been disruptive to biz this last week. Made the CCR their plaything and took over all internal security operations."**

He'd walk to one end of the counter and take a seat in a stool.

**"Eventually if all this keeps escalating, they shut the metro down. Which means for you, they'll shut down when our networks are leading into the other community's front door."**


[2/11/2025 11:34 PM] Hector "Hect"
**"If you want to get stranded on the other side, be my guest. I'll fork over the route you need to take to get there."**


[2/11/2025 11:40 PM] Kaedues Staub
**"I assumed they were the Regency's bots.."** *Kaedues pauses to consider that. Hector's talking about a route to Fairview. The redhead himself was thinking of a route to Jansville and back, but if it's really one-way, then..*

**"What's it cost?"** *He asks after a sec.*


[2/12/2025 8:42 PM] Hector "Hect"
**"You expect me to demand compensation for my services? Heh, not an unfounded assumption."** Kaedues would receive a file across his deck as Hector tapped his temple. **"Consider it an act of goodwill, choom."**


[2/12/2025 9:00 PM] Kaedues Staub
**"...I will be honest. My first impressions of you were sketchy. I like acts of goodwill. I'll see to it that I repay the favor somehow."** *Kaedues takes a look at the file before he would decide to leave or proceed.*


[2/12/2025 9:09 PM] Narration
The Metro layout seemed authentic; the file appeared to only be three months old and provided instructions on how to enter a service tunnel that was 'sealed' a long time ago, this was the service tunnel used by smugglers. Especially dealing with smugglers, there is no telling what kind of conduct they abided by since technically they are outside the metro.


[2/12/2025 9:21 PM] Kaedues Staub
*(I won't know if this is a safe path by any stretch of the imagination unless I check for myself.)*

*Kaedues begins to walk toward the place Hector sent him. In the meantime, he finds himself combing through his head for pass times, little actions he can do to pass the time before any real down-time comes his way.*

*But.. why? Why look for it?*

[2/12/2025 9:37 PM] Kaedues Staub
*This thought is especially pervasive, and it feels.. similar to something else familiar he can't quite put his finger on.*
*(I keep having this feeling. Ever since...)*

*...Ever since what? Thinking back, there's __nothing__ that could have incited him feeling this way.*
*(But there it is again..) That feeling spins to life like a screw that had been spun by an impact wrench. Before Kaedues could grasp it, why he thought it or even when, it was already there.*

*For a moment, for just a moment and not a second more, Kaedues stops to rest on an unoccupied wall. He looks at his hand, for a reason he doesn't even know.*
*(Why... did I get this, again?)*

*Kaedues was the type of person to never use cybernetics. He didn't hate them or anything, but he never thought that something like this could be necessary. So why did he have the hand installed?*
*(It doesn't... That.. It doesn't.. It's not..) Kaedues stutters to himself in the confines of his own head.*


[2/12/2025 9:37 PM] Kaedues Staub
*A chill, and then a warmth, rolls up Kaedues' back and across his arms. The conclusion to this feeling feels an arm's reach away-- no, a hand. A finger..*

*(What isn't.. it? Ugh..) Kaedues brings himself to his feet and continues walking to the destination Hector sent him. On his way, he finds himself calling Carlos, like he feels he should.*


[2/12/2025 9:44 PM] Narration
It was only a moment before Carlos came to. He was utilizing the video call feature, allowing his upper body to be tracked.


[2/12/2025 9:44 PM] Carlos
`"Hey, man. Called at a good time. Just finished a gig, ya sabes. (you know)"` He adjusted glasses and wore a thin grin.


[2/12/2025 10:08 PM] Kaedues Staub
*Kaedues' video call was automatically turned on when the call started. Kaedues doesn't make direct eye contact, or punctually respond to Carlos' opener, but after a moment he corrects himself in an almost hurried way.*
**"Hey."** *Kaedues pauses for a moment. His eyes scan the area around him on their own. That moment in time lingers a little longer, and just before Carlos is afforded any opportunity to follow up.. Kaedues winds up speaking after all. His voice is a little hoarse.*
**"..Wanted to ask if your living situation is fine. Something like that."** *He clears his throat, and his voice sounds better.* **"I was away for a few days. When I came back, there was a big site. Like a bomb had gone off."**


[2/12/2025 10:12 PM] Carlos
Carlos' slight smile faltered for a brief moment before returning. `"Yeah, everything on my end is good. Work is steady... About the bomb going off, I saw it. This huge nave aérea (airship) came out of nowhere and zapeó (zapped) one of the buildings into the next generation."`


[2/12/2025 10:15 PM] Kaedues Staub
**"..I'm sorry?"** *His expression sours.* **"..How high up was it?"**


[2/12/2025 10:18 PM] Carlos
`"The nave aérea (airship)? It was low, low enough to take out a large building in Littleton if it wanted to."`


[2/12/2025 10:24 PM] Kaedues Staub
**"..I didn't hear about that.."** *Kaedues trails off.*


[2/12/2025 10:26 PM] Kaedues Staub
**"I.. didn't check the news?"** *He says it like it's a question..*


[2/12/2025 10:43 PM] Carlos
`"I don't know how you didn't, hermano (brother). I heard that those on the far side of Kapea y Jansville (Kapea and Jansville) felt the ground move. Whoever they were after, they wanted them muerto (dead). Must've been related to that ataque terrorista (terrorist attack) in Fairview a couple days ago. Really pissed off the 5-0."`


[2/12/2025 10:45 PM] Kaedues Staub
*Kaedues slowly raises a hand to his forehead. He says nothing, but his somewhat surprised expression could give away that he didn't know about the Fairview terrorist attack either.*

*(That's..)*


[2/12/2025 10:46 PM] Carlos
`"Estás bien, hombre? (You alright, man?)"` Carlos's posture shifted and his right eyebrow rose slightly. Questioning why Kaedues was reactin' in such a way.


[2/12/2025 10:50 PM] Kaedues Staub
**"--No. Nothing you just said makes sense. I don't remember any of this. What time, an estimate? When did that laser fire?"**


[2/12/2025 10:54 PM] Carlos
`"Uh... mierda (shit), when was it? Two days ago? It wasn't that long ago. Had to be yesterday or the day before that. Was all over the news nets like no one's business."`


[2/12/2025 10:54 PM] Kaedues Staub
**"Was the sun out?"**


[2/12/2025 10:55 PM] Carlos
`"No, it happened during the night."`


[2/12/2025 10:57 PM] Kaedues Staub
*(Was I sleeping?)*
*`(Don't be stupid. Apparently, the ground shook.) The thought rings out in his head.`*

**"..That.. doesn't work. That doesn't work."** *Kaedues mutters to himself loud enough to be understood over the call. He crouches down and his eyebrows furrow, clearly thinking about much.*


[2/12/2025 11:02 PM] Carlos
`"...Erm, I should stop talking, huh?"` He said awkwardly, scratching behind his ear, just underneath his cap.


[2/12/2025 11:06 PM] Kaedues Staub
**"...Hold on. Sorry to take your time, but I need you on-call for a sec."**
*While the call continues, Kaedues accesses the internet and searches for news reports from around two days ago, trying to double check Carlos' claims.*

[2/12/2025 11:15 PM] Narration
Despite the CCR's best efforts to suppress most of the information online, this specific situation was too big to cover up. Numerous articles, outlets, and videos surfaced online with Kaedues' query. After reviewing one of the videos, Kaedues watched a vlog from a residence in Haven Heights that happened to be nearby, talking about their shitty life until **the ship** came into view behind him. The vlogger spun around and said a few choice words before the laser strike struck down a few blocks away. The concussion was visible, and it went as far as tearing off siding and roofs off their foundations. Windows shattered, and loose objects flew up and out in all directions. The vlogger ducked, and the video cuts off.

Another video was a CCTV camera they managed to procure and put on their property. It viewed down the alleyway partially where the ship struck. Kaeudes could see **Two** individuals emerge from the back of a building. One large male and a younger female in tow carrying boxes. They had a conversation until the ship came over them... The footage couldn't see the ship since the camera was facing down the alley. But the blast nearly was too quick for the camera to register before it went black. The other videos were primarily reruns of those most popular ones, while others were accounts and aftermath footage of the place. **It did happen.**


[2/12/2025 11:44 PM] Kaedues Staub
-# **"what.."**
*Kaedues' eyes are glued to the outlets he found online. He seems less present now.* **"Thanks, Carlos.. I will call you back. I still need to ask you something later."** *He thinks about hanging up. He has to will himself to actually go through with it.*

*(My windows were blown out. There are news outlets proving this to be true. I.. saw the wreckage myself. That's not right. It can't be right, it doesn't fit the narrative.)*
*His eyebrows raise as he thinks of it like that. The word, 'narrative' rings out.*

*(Fitting the narrative..) A lot of things come to mind when he thinks about this phrase.*
*The idea that Danny was abducted fits the narrative told by the order his family went missing at.*
*The character he put on to snoop on that Xavier person fit the narrative of what he knew to be someone from the Metro.*
*But then.. there are other concepts. Vaguely defined thoughts that were cast aside.*


[2/12/2025 11:44 PM] Kaedues Staub
-# *(Monita looks just like haven heights.)*                     *(Grace is afraid of heights.)*
-# *(I repaired Gavyn's van with that money, too.)*                                                      *(I ordered my own prosthetic using the money I was paid during those five days.)*

*Thinking twice about it.. those things feel to Kaedues like they are as important as the earth-shaking laser he just saw.. and that makes no sense at all. Just like this whole situation.*
*(Actually.. a few of these things __break the narrative__, I think. If I were.. present for those things, then I should have been present to hear about or feel the laser strike. Something is wrong there.)*


[2/13/2025 12:06 AM] Carlos
`"See you.."` Carlos disconnected the call.

[2/14/2025 1:25 PM] Kaedues Staub
*(There's no way to actually know.) The thought alone makes his hairs stand on end. (I have to know. I have to know what is making this happen.)*
*His dark voids narrow in on a bug crawling on the ground. (Gavyn's phone call.. and that dream last night..)*

*Kaedues' one roughened hand raises to gently grasp his forehead. (I'm losing it..)*
*(What is the point of that? The details appear in my head when I need them.) His eyebrows furrow together in frustration. (I didn't choose that.. but that is obvious. Whatever is wrong with me, I don't think I know enough to find out.)*

*Kaedues pinches his index finger and thumb together hard enough for his knuckles to pinch back. It hurts.*
*That sharpened feeling helps to ground his perspective. Right now, what matters is getting to where he needs to be, and that's going to have to be enough.*
*The redhead rises to his feet and sets out to finish the walk toward the location Hector gave him.*


[2/14/2025 2:13 PM] Narration
Kaedues followed the map with ease, his route through the tunnels familiar for a good portion of the journey. The air buzzed with the voices of vendors calling out their latest deals and customers bartering for better prices. But as he pressed on, the surroundings became increasingly unfamiliar. The deeper he ventured into Metro, the more the landscape shifted.

The tunnel eventually widened into a vast terminal-like space. An elevated platform loomed overhead, remnants of a collapsed ceiling now repurposed into makeshift shops by determined vendors. Four tunnels branched off from the area—two on each side—while a service hall lingered on the outskirts, its entrance shrouded in dim light and suspicion. The hall reeked of desperation, a haven for drug addicts and those who thrived in society’s shadows.

And that was exactly where the map led him. Kaedues needed to find the men's bathroom. It was his next step of the map and instructions.


[2/14/2025 2:47 PM] Kaedues Staub
*Kaedues does his best to memorize the route and the area. He had assumed this place would be secured somehow. Best not to drop that assumption just yet, though.*

*Despite the atmosphere, Kaedues decides to venture toward the service hall. He might find a bathroom there..*


[2/16/2025 1:09 PM] Narration
Kaedues entered the service hall and immediately noticed how many people were loitering around the area. The Metro had a reputation for being a hotbed of shady characters, but this was on a completely different level. Kaedues stood out like a sore thumb to everyone in the hall, as he was clearly an outsider. Many individuals under the influence didn't pay much attention, but those who were alert and present stopped whatever they were doing to observe him closely.

The bathroom—where exactly was this bathroom? Kaedues passed several doors, none of which indicated anything related to a bathroom. Then, up ahead were two doors, one for each sex. Perfect.


[2/16/2025 1:18 PM] Kaedues Staub
*Kaedues stops at the end of the hall to survey it, to take a look at the people inside. His gut tells him that he won't be treated like a friend, but that's fine. They don't know him, after all.*

*He begins to approach the men's bathroom. If he isn't stopped, he'd walk right in and take a look around.*


[2/16/2025 1:31 PM] Narration
As Kaedues entered the bathroom without being intercepted, the dilapidated state of the facility reminded him of the rest of Haven Heights... It was obvious that maintenance had been neglected for quite some time. Half of the urinals were not operational, clogged, or completely destroyed, while the others seemed to be in a precarious balance, threatening to collapse at any moment. Only one sink had running water, and soap wasn't an option. The mirrors were cracked, the tiles on the walls were chipped and missing, and the stench of urine was overwhelming.

There were four stalls. Two were occupied, while the third door was slightly ajar, indicating that someone was not inside. However, the fourth stall looked like it had no door.

Despite the poor conditions, the bathroom was still in use, and Kaedues could hear muffled sounds coming from behind the occupied stalls. There was a guy at one of the sinks with the best mirror injecting himself with a syringe and getting giddy as whatever it was he was injecting began working its way through his system.


[2/16/2025 1:37 PM] Kaedues Staub
*Kaedues runs his fingers through his hair, shaking his palm around to loosen the strands and let his scalp breathe.. then again, who'd want to breathe at all right now what with the stench?*

*When Kaedues inhales, he almost regrets it completely. Only by committing to ignore all of the red flags here does he muster the motivation to take a look around. His source says the entrance to this service tunnel is here..*
*To get the easy options out of the way, Kaedues approaches the third stall, the one with the open door. He grabs hold of it and pulls, looking inside the place.*


[2/16/2025 1:43 PM] Narration
Kaedues would be greeted with a stall filled with vandalism on the stall walls, the back wall, and the toilet itself. It also goes without saying that the floor also received some love with artistic expression...If you ignore the caked urine, give the art a polished look. Nothing of interest here unless he wants to find out if the last user was kind enough to flush... if they could.

[2/16/2025 1:46 PM] Kaedues Staub
*(Not here.)*
*Kaedues steps back, shut the door, and approaches the stall that has no door at all. He blinks hard. The smell makes his eyes sting, which invites a plethora of unsavory ideas in his head. He presses on, though.*


[2/16/2025 1:49 PM] Narration
Aside from the plumbing tubes that jutted from the floor, the toilet was missing entirely. There was a vent cover on the wall where the toilet should've been.


[2/16/2025 1:55 PM] Kaedues Staub
*Kaedues approaches the vent cover and takes a look at what he's working with here. He didn't consider that it would be a vent, so he didn't bring any tools. __He makes a mental note of that__.*


[2/16/2025 2:05 PM] Narration
Immediately upon coming close to the vent cover, Kaedues could feel a consistent draft coming from the vent. Usually, vents would draw air out of an area, but this one was doing the exact opposite. There was subtle lighting between the horizontal bars, but there was not enough visual real estate to make out any details beyond. Finally, the vent seemed to be partially recessed in the wall with no screws or bolts to hold it in place... He could pull it out if his fingers were between the bars.


[2/16/2025 2:09 PM] Kaedues Staub
*One set of rough fingers reaches forward and grabs the vent by the bars. He intends to pull it off of the wall now.*
*(It's blowing the other way. Why?) It's not like it sucks out oxygen. Kaedues wonders whether this detail matters if this would be used as a travel route.*


[2/16/2025 2:19 PM] Narration
The vent gave way and popped out of the wall, revealing a sizeable hole large enough to fit a person through. Just beyond the hole was a tunnel that went to the left somewhere. Lights were fixed upon the top of this small tunnel, allowing safe passage.


[2/16/2025 2:26 PM] Kaedues Staub
*Kaedues takes a breath in. He pauses for a moment before exhaling to consider whether or not committing to this would actually be worth it..*
*Unfortunately, he feels that he does not have much choice. He climbs into the hole in the wall and is relieved to find out that it's more of a tunnel than a vent at all. He returns the vent cover to where it had been before and walks down the tunnel now..*

*Thankfully, has he continues forward Kaedues finds that this place no longer reeks. Thank fuck.*


[2/16/2025 4:48 PM] Narration
Kaedues wasn't aware of it, but the tweaker shooting up moments earlier stared at the hole as soon as the vent cover was returned. **"..."**


[2/16/2025 5:07 PM] Narration
The tunnel was well-lit and seemed to stretch for a while—more than a mile, for sure. Large electrical conduit ran haphazardly throughout the space, and actual ventilation ducts were high and low. This is the smuggling route Hector was speaking about...


[2/16/2025 9:22 PM] Kaedues Staub
*Kaedues does his best to commit the entire stretch to memory. He commits to making it to the other end, for now.*
*(Feeling like I'm overdue for a catch. My hairs are standing on end.)*


[2/18/2025 6:36 PM] Narration
Kaedues navigated skillfully through the hazardous maze. Bounding in and out, left and right of the obstacles. The tunnel became easier the further Kaedues went, and soon after, he could walk comfortably without running into anything. Occasionally, people would walk the path: Going in the opposite direction has him. Most of which obscured their identities in one way or another. After all, if you live on the other side, you wouldn't want to be caught dead moving about illegally.

There were __NO__ incidents throughout the journey.

[3/2/2025 9:33 PM] Narration
Kaedues arrived at the Metro, and the activity didn't seem to be any much different than during the later times of the day; Guess the place never sleeps.

Hector was not in this early, so his immediate contact that he made in the Metro was unavailable for the time being.


[3/2/2025 10:43 PM] Kaedues Staub
*Kaedues takes note of Hector's absence. He nods.*
*(There ought to be a second person, anyway. It would be good for me.)*

*Kaedues opts to just walk into the metro, He keeps his head on a slow swivel, not ashamed to appear as though he is looking for something. He is of course looking for work, for anyone who looks like they need a hand with something. More than that, he's looking for anyone who is doing what he is doing; fixers. He's not very well versed with the Metro's area, but regardless he looks for anywhere that might appear to be a hangout spot or commune for people who are looking for work.*


[3/2/2025 10:58 PM] Narration
Kaedues did not have to look for long as he came across an establishment named the *'The Salty Glitch'*. A neon sign was mounted above the door. The G and the L were burnt out, which could give anyone the impression that it said *'The Salty Bitch'.* Either way, it was a favorite spot considering how busy it was this early in the morning.


[3/2/2025 11:01 PM] Kaedues Staub
*Kaedues takes a good, long look at the establishment before moving to walk on in.*

The Salty Glitch hums with a low tension, a neon haze casting shadows deep constrasting shadows across the cracked concrete walls. It smells of booze (cheap liquor), burnt circuitry that failed at least a dozen inspections, and the faint musk smoke from various smoking products.

A man at the counter nurses his drink in silence... The bartender, a weary specter of the district's underbelly, moves with a slow but controlled efficiency of someone who has seen too much and cares too little. 

Conversations here are quiet , murmered exchanges of hushed deals. Beyond the archway, the deeper part of the establishment appears to have some dealing going on. Figures drifting across the ground like ghosts, their faces by hoods and the sharp contrasts of the colors present. A bouncer seemed to be positioned between the bar and whatever was going on back there.

[3/2/2025 11:40 PM] Kaedues Staub
*Kaedues isn't necessarily __unfamiliar__ with this kind of behavior, but even he feels out of place when the patrons lay it on so thick. So an extent, one might feel like a waste of space by taking up one of the seats two others would use to discuss a deal of theirs.*

*After looking around at the people in the bar, Kaedues approaches one of the stools and sits down.*
*(Ordering a drink is par for the course in a place like this.. but I almost don't feel comfortable drinking here.)*
*For the immediate future, Kaedues makes a point of waiting. Maybe he hears something, maybe he doesn't. Listening to the way these people talk is valuable enough, at least.*


[3/2/2025 11:49 PM] Narration
The conversations that were going on between patrons were broken and unorderly. If one conversation was being had, another soon followed, creating a mesh of whispers preventing Kaedues from picking up anything tangable for his use case. Talk about the Vesperian Legionaries, this mandatory firmware that the governing body is forcing everyone to get and other topics which Kaedues had already heard once before.

The man that was nursing his drink side-eyed Kaedues. Why was he just sitting there and not getting anything? This would be on the man's mind, but nothing he would voice openly to the newcomer.

[3/3/2025 12:10 AM] Kaedues Staub
*The side-eye is enough of a signal for Kaedues to raise a hand and softly call out to the bartender. He spots a QR code denoting the menu on the counter nearby and scans it before continuing with his call.*

**"A glass of Wesley's on the rocks. Thanks in advance."** *Is all he says.*


[3/3/2025 12:25 AM] Narration
The bartender fails to acknowledge Kaedues in any way other than preparing his drink immediately. Word nor eye contact were necessary within the biz here in the Metro. After a short amount of time, the bartender dropped Kaedues' drink off before him and continued what he was doing.

**"Hey there, pal."** A voice piped behind Kaedues, but it wasn't for him. That bouncer and two other of his boys approached a patron who was seated with a friend of his. Placing his hands on the patron's shoulders and...rubbing them?

**"The Boss wants to see you,"** he says before gripping the man's jacket and pulling him out of the chair.  **"Now."**

**"H-hey! Woah now! What did I do? Is it about that loan? I said I was going to pay it tomorrow!"** The patron questioned, clearly shaken by the sudden events. However, the question went unanswered as he was literally dragged into the back rooms.

*Kaedues sends the funds for the drink to the register. He turns his head to look at the unfolding situation and takes a long sip of his glass of beer.*

*For a brief moment, it tastes funny. But only for a moment.*


[3/3/2025 12:35 AM] Kaedues Staub
*He makes good on downing the rest of the glass. One of those won't cook him for the day. Actually, it might be good to loosen up a little, even if the thought of such a thing brings stress in of itself.*

*Now, Kaedues stands up and moves to leave the bar entirely. Not like sitting around is gonna help him find anyone else, and even Kaedues can tell that asking around is against ettiquette here in the Metro.*


[3/3/2025 5:33 PM] Narration
Kaedues stepped out of the dimly lit bar, the cool tunnel air brushing against his skin. Suddenly, he felt a sharp tug as someone yanked the hood of his sweatshirt, pulling him sharply to the left. This would prompt him to backpedal...

In that fleeting moment of disorientation, a moped roared to life, careening past Kaedues. The rider, a shadowy silhouette against the overhead lights, struggled to steer as he clutched overflowing duffle bags. With each sharp turn, the bags gaped open, spilling a chaotic assortment of shards, tools, and loose weapons scattered across the ground. The echo of the moped's engine reverberated through the tunnel, creating a sense of chaotic urgency.

**"Stop that guy!"** Someone shouted from where the moped came from. But the moped did not take long to b-line it into a group of people. The crowd instinctively surged to the sides, narrowly avoiding disaster. In that pivotal moment, the moped driver, fueled by adrenaline and panic, failed to notice the formidable concrete post looming ominously in the center of the dimly lit tunnel. In a heart-stopping instant, the moped crashed into the post with a sickening thud, sending the driver soaring through the air like a ragdoll. He tumbled to the ground, his contraband scattering around him in a chaotic flurry, resembling confetti in a storm. Dazed and disoriented, the driver struggled to regain his senses as his pursuers—now emboldened by the spectacle—moved in with determined haste, pouncing on the man.

The scattered contraband that slipped from the grasp of the frustrated robber was swiftly seized by passersby, their eyes glinting with opportunistic excitement. Each item, from gleaming tech to designer clothing, was quickly scooped up as those fortunate enough to be in the right place at the right time began to assess their unexpected windfall. These people were quick to flee the area themselves.


[3/3/2025 5:39 PM] Kaedues Staub
*Kaedues is initially shocked or surprised by the feeling of being tugged, but the immediate ensuing scene leads him to believe he may have been saved. He stands there, watching the scene unfold for a moment.*
*(A moped.. If you had to drive something down here, that's what. It's a shitty idea in the first place though.)*

*After the surprise of witnessing such a thing though, Kaedues steps to his right and turns around. He gets a look at who grabbed him, first and foremost, and also pats himself down. Now would be a particularly good time to pickpocket someone.*


[3/3/2025 5:51 PM] Nico
**"Ty v poryadke... You alright, man?"** The man who rescued Kaedues was exasperated, taking a deep breath as he almost witnessed the guy get smoked by a moped. **"That moped almost took you out."** The man was wearing a beanie and a trench coat. Both of his hands were 100% cybernetic, and with the shifting of his sleeve, his right arm was of the same manufacturer.  He then looked off towards the carnage.


[3/3/2025 6:05 PM] Kaedues Staub
*Kaedues' colorless eyes snake around Nico's features and commit much of him to memory, especially his expression given the circumstances. Unexpected moments like this are good defining moments for people's character.*

**"Yes. I am fine, thanks to you."** *Kaedues responds flatly. His gaze narrows just a little..*

**"Are you from around here?"**


[3/3/2025 6:10 PM] Nico
**"Me? Nah."** Nico pocketed his hands, briefly looking towards Kaedues, then back towards the ongoing entertainment.


[3/3/2025 6:13 PM] Kaedues Staub
*Kaedues nods to himself; he had assumed that. He directs his attention toward the unfortunate moped driver as well, and decides to continue with the conversation.*

**"I'm not, either. Hard to talk to anyone who wouldn't even think about reaching an arm out."**


[3/3/2025 6:27 PM] Nico
**It has been poteryano in this community; a loss. Been around when the Metro was just a small-time thing. Tight-knit as hell, but got too big and well... We are left with this. "** He'd nod in the direction of the scene before them. **"Things in District 9 sure are ran differently."** He muttered more to himself.


[3/3/2025 6:41 PM] Kaedues Staub
**"I'm sorry?"** *Kaedues hears Nico well enough but what he said does not make sense.*
*(He says he is not from around here, but also says he was around the Metro in an older time... What is this guy talking about?)*


[3/3/2025 6:46 PM] Nico
Nico glanced towards Kaedues. ** "The Metro, it isn't that old. The location is. The organized community down here is more recent. Desyat' let, merely a decade old."**


[3/3/2025 6:54 PM] Kaedues Staub
*This information resonates a little with Kaedues.*
**"I've never heard of something like that,"** *he states plainly.* **"But I haven't heard of much when it comes to this place."**

*Kaedues now turns his body around entirely to face Nico. He makes a point of looking into his eyes for a spell.*
**"You wouldn't happen to know anyone who needs something done, would you?"**


[3/3/2025 6:56 PM] Nico
Nico watches Kaedues curiously briefly before asking, **"You a Runner?"**


[3/3/2025 7:02 PM] Kaedues Staub
*Kaedues shakes his head.*
**"Not unless you mean on foot, I'm not."** *He responds punctually.* **"Never was in the right spot to learn that kind of thing."**

*Then, he pushes his hands into his pant pockets.*
**"It's actually just about the only thing I __don't__ do.."** *He admits, sounding.. defeated?*


[3/3/2025 7:05 PM] Nico
**"...mnn."** His eyebrow twitched once, his curiosity spiking briefly before proceeding. **"I have a person who fixes jobs. But, I will be the first to tell you that they aren't your typical job. Many of which are dangerous... But it's the danger that pays well."**


[3/3/2025 7:13 PM] Kaedues Staub
*Kaedues nods.* **"Danger I can handle."**
*He takes a deep breath in and out before proceeding. The air down here doesn't get the right kind of fill, but he'll have to deal with it.* **"Is there any price for knowing about this person?"** *He goes on to ask, straight to the point. He doesn't make anything of Nico's subtle movements.*


[3/3/2025 7:38 PM] Nico
Nico brought one of his hands from his pocket, grooming his beard. Quite the question! **"Got any intel on a guy that goes by the name 'Squeeps'?"**


[3/3/2025 7:40 PM] Kaedues Staub
**"Nope, never heard."** *He is quick to answer.* **"If he frequents this place, then that is probably why."** *Kaedues' eyes point up at the ceiling for a moment, and then fall back down to Nico.* **"Not saying I won't get you the info you need though."**


[3/3/2025 7:44 PM] Nico
**"Nah, don't worry about it... Been down here, lookin' for him for a while. He blends in, surprisingly."** Nico would flash Kaedues an address in Littleton. **"Name's Digit, the bar-restaurant on the second floor is where he frequents. Tell him what your talents are; he'll find you work, no doubt."**


[3/3/2025 7:44 PM] Nico
**"If he asks, drop the name 'Nico'."**


[3/3/2025 7:50 PM] Kaedues Staub
*Kaedues pauses for a spell and then nods.* **"I prefer to pay off favors sent my way,"** *He says and leans foward just a hair.* **"I could have been in a world of hurt had you not been here. If you need something done, let me know. If it's one-and-done, I'll do it on the house."**

*Now he leans back and taps his temple with his finger, shooting Nico his numbers.*


[3/3/2025 7:52 PM] Nico
**"I'll keep a tab on that. Take it easy."** He looked left and right. It was time for him to get back to finding that thing.


[3/3/2025 7:54 PM] Kaedues Staub
*Kaedues doesn't continue the discussion any further. A fixer is a big point to focus on, and Kaedues figures he should make good on that. Without missing a beat, Kaedues moves to exit the Metro entirely.*

*(Been heading to Littleton more than usual lately.) A foreign feeling washes over him when he thinks about it. Not bad, but unfortunately incomprehensible.*

[3/7/2025 8:28 PM] Hector "Hect"
Hector was watching the news on a holographic display on the counter of his store in the Metro. They were really starting to round people up in Fairview who were not adhering to the mandate regarding the firmware updates. **"mmn."** He'd hum to himself as the news anchor urged citizens to comply with the regulation and to find the nearest ripper doc clinic to get the work done.


[3/7/2025 8:42 PM] Ghost
*If Hector paid attention, he would hear footsteps approaching. It was none other than Ghost, alive and well, carrying the __duffle bag__ Hector had once provided him at a low cost. Cole moved slowly and deliberately toward the counter, the air thick with cold silence. For a brief moment, neither spoke. Who would be the one to break it, **Hector or Ghost?***


[3/7/2025 8:48 PM] Hector "Hect"
Hector was paying attention alright, but who could tell with him always wearing his sunglasses indoors. **"Fred hasn't paid up. A shame, but doesn't matter. I'll get my money one way or another."** The display would turn off and Hector would turn his head in Ghost's direction. **"What will it be?"**


[3/7/2025 8:58 PM] Ghost
*Cole dropped the duffle bag onto the counter with a rough thud. No hesitation. No wasted words.*

**"Something reliable. Silent. Portable. Make it quick."**  

*Whatever Freddie had said about Hector was irrelevant. The past didn’t matter. Only the next move did.*


[3/7/2025 9:06 PM] Hector "Hect"
He would get up from his chair, walking towards the back. **"Pistol, collaspable submachine gun?"**


[3/7/2025 9:07 PM] Ghost
*Ghost gave a slight nod before speaking, his tone flat and to the point.*

**"I’ll __buy__ what I need. After that, I have things to __offload.__"**


[3/7/2025 9:14 PM] Hector "Hect"
-# **"Playing roulette eh?"** 
He said from the back. A few moments later, he came walking back up to the front with a case and sat  it flat on the counter. Turning it so the locks faced him, he should be able to inspect the goods before bartering.


[3/7/2025 9:29 PM] Ghost
*[Ghost picked up the sleek, matte-black pistol, turning it over in his hand with a practiced eye.](https://youtu.be/FMyB3ykRGZU?si=GsophilVZHashDyf) The weight was solid but balanced, the grip textured just right for a firm hold. His gaze trailed along the illuminated red symbol on the side, __smart functionality__, no doubt. The suppressor, long and vented, promised clean, silent kills.*

*His thumb ran over the engraving.* **"TAC-45B1... Military edition."** *His tone remained flat, but there was a certain understanding behind it. He checked the mechanism, noting the real selling point, the **detonation rounds.** A weapon that could place shots and trigger them remotely. Tactical. Precise.* **"They call this Azrael’s Judgement for a reason."** *He glanced back up, his lifeless stare unwavering.* **"It doesn’t just kill. It decides when you die."**

[3/7/2025 9:38 PM] Ghost
*Ghost placed the pistol back in its original spot and spoke coldly.* **"How much? I want twenty magazines, ten __standard__, ten __detonation__."**


[3/7/2025 11:07 PM] Hector "Hect"
**"It wasn't easy getting my hands on the beauty. Hard to get smart weapons through Monita. The handgun is 4 grand, alone.  Twenty magazines with an even split? The detonation magazines will run your pockets dry. Total, we're looking at 8 grand flat."**


[3/7/2025 11:10 PM] Ghost
*Ghost remained unfazed, his red eyes locked onto Hector.* **“I’ll pay. Just get it done.”**

*Without hesitation, he wired the money, leaving his total balance at 9,000 micros.*

*But he wasn’t done yet.*


[3/7/2025 11:11 PM] Hector "Hect"
**"Anything else before I fetch the magazines?"**


[3/7/2025 11:12 PM] Ghost
**“SMGs aren’t my usual choice, but I need one.”** *His tone was precise.*


[3/7/2025 11:14 PM] Hector "Hect"
**"Similar specs?"**


[3/7/2025 11:20 PM] Ghost
**”Kinetic.”**


[3/7/2025 11:35 PM] Ghost
*Since Ghost had already paid, he reached out, firmly gripping the pistol before holstering it at his waist. His trench coat concealed it perfectly, making it nearly undetectable. Now, all that was left was to wait for the rest of his gear.*


[3/8/2025 12:05 AM] Hector "Hect"
He would return with a sub-machine gun without a case of its own. Additionally, he had a box full of magazines, filled to the brim with ammunition already stacked within the magazines.


[3/8/2025 12:05 AM] Ghost
**“How much.”**


[3/8/2025 12:06 AM] Hector "Hect"
**"Trying to get rid of this model fast so you'll get a discount. 800."**


[3/8/2025 12:08 AM] Ghost
*Ghost nodded slightly, his expression unchanged.* **“I’ll take it.”** *he said, his voice cold and direct. He wired the payment, now leaving him with 8,200 micros.*


[3/8/2025 12:11 AM] Hector "Hect"
**"These two weapons share the same caliber and are sporting 135 grain shells. If they aren't sportin tech or plates that are level II+ or greater, it'll go through a man like butter."**


[3/8/2025 12:20 AM] Ghost
*Ghost unzipped his duffle bag and stowed the SMG inside, along with its respective magazines. He then turned his attention to the pistol’s magazines, carefully organizing them. He placed each one in the rows of pouches on his tactical vest, splitting the 20 magazines, 10 with normal rounds and 10 with detonation rounds, across the two rows. Everything fit perfectly.*

**“I’m satisfied.”** *he stated flatly.*

*Then, with precision, Cole reached up with both hands to __[remove](https://youtu.be/f3FGMJpc39A?si=Grat27p1LYvltgrP)__ his mask. The motion was slow, deliberate, as he carefully took it off. He gazed at the interior for a moment, the pristine sophistication of it catching his attention. For a brief second, he lingered on the sight, his thoughts momentarily distant, before snapping back to reality.*

*He placed the mask gently on the counter, his eyes narrowing as he locked his gaze on Hector.*

**“How much would you buy it?”** *he asked, his voice firm.*

[3/8/2025 3:48 PM] Hector "Hect"
**"Hmph, depends on what it is spec'd with."** He would pick up the mask before walking down the length of the counter towards a device he had attached to the counter top. Hector pressed his index finger inside a recessed plate and once it was removed, the plate flipped open—exposed was a jack which he processed to pull on until the jack was long enough for him to plug it into the mask's port.

The screen on the front of the device (on hector's side) began populating the information and specs of the mask.


[3/8/2025 3:50 PM] ?
*Cole waited patiently, though time was ticking. He could have listed the specs himself, but it was better to let Hector confirm them. Truth be told, Cole had no idea how much it would be worth.*


[3/8/2025 3:52 PM] ?
*However, it had only been a day since he obtained this mask from Freddie. It should still be in great condition, hopefully...*


[3/8/2025 4:23 PM] Hector "Hect"
**"A nicely packaged mask you got here. How old is it?"** He asked while seemingly look at the monitor.


[3/8/2025 4:25 PM] ?
**"One day old. Hard earned."** *His tone was flat, giving no hint of attachment, just business. It was hard to tell how Cole truly felt about it, but giving it up this easily?*


[3/8/2025 5:04 PM] Hector "Hect"
**"9 bands... Considering these are manufactured anymore and has custom functions... Did you get this from a merchant or was it custom?"** He unplugged the mask from his device and held the mask up, inspecting it visually.


[3/8/2025 5:09 PM] ?
*Cole remained unfazed.* **"Custom. Retrieved it off someone... __special.__"** *His response was cold, clipped, and direct.*


[3/8/2025 5:20 PM] Hector "Hect"
**"Does that work for you?"**


[3/8/2025 5:42 PM] ?
*Cole responded without hesitation.* **"Not exactly."** *His tone was firm, leaving no room for debate. He let the silence linger for a few seconds before continuing.*  

**"I won't take anything less than __10,000__ micros. This wasn't just some easy pickup. It's one of a kind."**


[3/8/2025 5:55 PM] Hector "Hect"
**"I'll tell you what, I will give you 10 grand since you're starting to become a regular here."** He'd wire Cole 10 grand exact.


[3/8/2025 5:58 PM] ?
*Cole let out a low grunt, another one of his vague signs of approval. With the transaction complete, he received the money and was ready to move. He reached for his duffle bag, gripping it firmly before turning on his heel and heading out. Next stop, __**a ripperdoc.**__*


[3/8/2025 6:38 PM] Narration
Neon strips flickered erratically overhead, barely illuminating the clusters of vendor stalls lining the walls—each one a haven for those looking to buy, sell, or trade without corporate oversight. 

Cole walked through the metro and as he went, to his left, a vendor with cybernetic arms displayed an array of chipped-out augments on a ragged cloth, their once-polished chrome now dulled from repeated use. Across from him, a masked dealer whispered hurried negotiations with a buyer over a crate of unmarked stims.

At the far end of one of the tunnels, past a heavy steel door marked with faded hazard symbols, was his destination. The entrance was subtle—just a neon-red glyph painted onto the wall, its meaning known only to __those in the know__. 

There was a biometric scanner beside the door.


[3/8/2025 6:42 PM] ?
*Cole approached the scanner without hesitation, his expression as cold as ever. He raised his hand, letting the device run its verification process.*


[3/8/2025 6:51 PM] Narration
He pressed his hand against a biometric scanner beside the door, and after a moment of consideration, it hissed open.

Inside, the air shifted—cleaner but tinged with antiseptic and burnt circuits. The clinic was small, cluttered with old but functional machinery. A single surgical chair sat in the center, its synthetic leather cracked with age, while robotic arms hung from the ceiling like dormant spiders. A holo-display flickered to life, casting a blue hue over the room as a figure emerged from the back.

**"Didn’t think I’d be seeing you alive."** the ripperdoc said, wiping his hands on a stained cloth. His cybernetic eye was a telescoping eye that while fully extended could reach out as far as four inches from his eyelids. It whirred and adjusted its zoom as it calibrated, scanning Cole up and down. ***"Chrome not to your liking?"**


[3/8/2025 7:04 PM] ?
*Cole didn’t flinch as the ripperdoc’s eye scanned him, his expression as cold and detached as ever. He leaned against the nearest wall, arms crossed, eyes narrowing slightly.*

**“No,”** *Cole replied, his voice flat.* **“I need a full overhaul. And I’ll be looking into replacing a limb or two, depending on your pricing.”**


[3/9/2025 8:01 PM] Narration
**"Tsk tsk, Limb replacements aren't cheap."** The ripperdoc would remark, taking a seat in his signature rolling stool. **"We are talkin' 10 grand starting a piece on our lower-end models."**


[3/9/2025 8:13 PM] ?
*Cole didn’t waver, his gaze locked onto the ripperdoc.* **"Anything’s better than this,"** *he stated flatly. Stepping forward, he continued,* **"How much for a full cosmetic overhaul? I need to be __unrecognizable.__"**

[3/9/2025 9:06 PM] Narration
The ripperdoc placed his dominat hand on his knee and looking at Cole. **"How much you got?"**


[3/9/2025 9:11 PM] ?
*Cole responded without hesitation,* **"18,200 total. Running low lately."** *He exhaled lightly.*


[3/9/2025 9:16 PM] Narration
The ripperdoc would grumble, **"I can catch who you are cosemtically for 12 grand, but for upgraded specs, those aren't cheap and certainly outside of your budget. You'll have to come back with more micros for the upgrades."** 

Doc would then take a small flathead screwdriver to recalibrate a notch on his cybernetic hand. Guess Cole had a choice—coesmetics, or a single limb being upgraded to a basic package.


[3/9/2025 9:17 PM] ?
*Cole remained silent for a moment, his eyes locked onto the ripperdoc’s steady hands. Then, without wasting a moment, he made his decision.*

**“Cosmetics first.”** *His tone was absolute.* **“Upgrades can wait.”**


[3/9/2025 9:21 PM] Narration
**"Take a seat."** He'd then direct cole. He'd wheel his chair towards a console which controlled the spider like robotic arm. Firing it up for an potentially extensive procedure. **"Have you blacked out recently? Blunt force truama to the head?"** He'd inquiry as he continued interfacing with his systems.


[3/9/2025 9:25 PM] ?
*Cole stripped down methodically, starting with his trench coat, followed by his holster, tactical shirt, cargo pants, his underwear, and finally, his shoes.. His body bore the marks of past battles, scars and bullet wounds etched into his skin. He placed his belongings neatly in a secure, clean spot before walking over to take a seat.*  

*As the ripperdoc prepped, Cole answered.* **“Blacked out. Had a showdown with an old man.”** *His tone remained cold, detached.* **“He reverse engineered a tracker that was on me. __Remove it.__”**


[3/9/2025 9:36 PM] Narration
**"Mmn, hard to believe an old man had the ability to take __you__ down. Doesn't matter anyways, I'll remove it."** The robotic arm descended upon Cole slowly, stopping mere inches from his face. A lens within the palm of the robotic hand began scanning him. 

**"You have something in mind?"**


[3/9/2025 9:44 PM] ?
**"Change my face. Strong, chiselled jawline, high cheekbones, pronounced brow ridge. Keep the nose straight with a slightly prominent bridge, thin lips, and a downturned expression. Eyes deep set and intense, make them sharp. Long, slicked back hair, some loose strands, dark color. Keep the stubble, but no full beard. Make sure the scars are hidden, no trace left behind. Get it done clean."**


[3/9/2025 9:48 PM] Narration
The ripperdoc would jack Cole into the chair. **"Hope you don't got an date for a hours."**


[3/9/2025 9:49 PM] ?
*He scoffed at the thought, brushing it aside.* **"I’ve got time."**


[3/9/2025 9:50 PM] Narration
Data began to fill Cole's vision. Data decompiling his neural information and putting him to sleep in mere seconds. **"Good."**

Then blackness...


[3/9/2025 10:02 PM] Narration
Information compiled in Cole's head as his systems began to turn back on. Recompiling as parts of him has been reconstructed. This process took roughly 2 minutes and shortly after, Cole returned to the world of the living.

His eyes would open with the robotic arm retracting away from his face and returning to its idle position.


[3/9/2025 10:08 PM] ?
*Cole blinked a few times, his mind adjusting to the reconnection of his systems. Slowly, he reached his palm out, inspecting it for a brief moment before moving toward his discarded clothes. He first grabbed his underwear, putting them back on, then his black tactical shirt, pulling it over his head, ensuring each movement was deliberate. Next, he slipped into his black cargo pants, tightening the waistband slightly as he adjusted them comfortably around his waist. He grabbed his holster, strapping it to his side, securing it with practiced ease. Finally, he put on his long black trench coat, adjusting the collar and making sure it draped evenly. Once dressed, he wired the ripperdoc __12,000__ micros, his eyes scanning the room briefly before he stood up, ready to leave.*


[3/9/2025 10:11 PM] Narration
**"Great doing business with you."** The ripperdoc would give Cole a thumbs up.


[3/9/2025 10:13 PM] Cole Mercer
*Cole turned to face the mirror, his eyes scanning his new appearance. He stood there for a minute, assessing every detail, left, right, and then straight on. Once he was [satisfied](https://youtu.be/zncqa3CPX3A?si=_Byzae8rpzPzTaW7), he turned toward the exit. As he passed, he glanced back over his shoulder and spoke,* **"Your work is adequate. I'll return."**

[3/9/2025 10:20 PM] Cole Mercer
*A few minutes had passed since Cole removed the mask, and it was his first time in the metro without a disguise. Though, it wasn’t entirely accurate to say that, his current appearance was, in itself, a form of disguise. His left hand gripped the duffle bag as he made his way through the crowded streets, heading toward a place to eat. Returning to the hideout could wait, it had been a while since he’d afforded himself such a luxury.*


[3/9/2025 10:35 PM] Narration
Tucked away in a dimly lit corner of the underground metro market, The Hollow Den is one of the few places where both lurkers and misfits can enjoy a meal without watching their backs—too much, at least.

A converted train car serves as the main dining area, its interior gutted and refitted with a patched-up leather booths and tables bolted to the floor. The overhead lights flickered intermittenly, casting deep shadows, against the graffit-stained walls.

## The Hollow Den ##
Cole has been to place before, ran by some guy named Malik, a ex-corporate chef who was ran off by execs back in his day. Forfeiting a life of pesudo-luxury for a dented grill and a clienttele that pays stricly untaxed.

Today, the place was buzzing. patrons sit hunched over bowls and plates, low conversations occassionally punctuated by laughter or the click of a concealed weapon being adjusted under the table. 

A vacant booth near the back waits, the synth-lether torn at the edges. A perfect place to sit, eat, and listen—if he so chose to.


[3/9/2025 10:41 PM] Cole Mercer
*He moved through the crowd with his usual unhurried pace, his steps steady and controlled. The noise of the Hollow Den faded into the background as he made his way toward the vacant booth in the back. He noticed the torn edges of the synthetic leather but paid it no mind, it was just another imperfection in a place like this. He slid into the booth, dropping his duffle bag between his legs. His gaze scanned the room for a moment, taking in the familiar mix of faces, the quiet types, the ones trying to blend in, and the few who wore their weapons like a second skin. He leaned back, one arm resting on the edge of the table, the other loosely on his left thigh. Cole wasn’t here to socialise. He was here for the moment of solitude, the small luxury of sitting down without constantly being on edge. His eyes remained locked on the door, half-watching the patrons, while his mind drifted elsewhere.*


[3/9/2025 10:48 PM] Narration
A frame entered the edge of Cole's vision. Someone stood at the table he was seated at.


[3/9/2025 10:49 PM] Cole Mercer
*Cole’s eyes narrowed slightly, his body still and relaxed, yet his senses sharpened. The figure stood at the edge of his peripheral vision. Slowly, he turned his head, meeting the person’s gaze.*


[3/9/2025 10:55 PM] Narration
Ah, it was Rachel. Cole would recongize her as the waitress that has worked her for well.. A long time. **"What can I get you."** Her tone was unwelcoming, but damn was the food here good. Many of the regulars could get past her unapologetic personality.


[3/9/2025 10:58 PM] Cole Mercer
*Cole recognized her face. Right, Rachel. He responded curtly,* **"The usual."**


[3/9/2025 11:11 PM] Narration
Rachel gave him a sideways glance, **"The huh?"** Clearly she did not recongize Cole for who he was.


[3/9/2025 11:15 PM] Cole Mercer
*This confirmed that his disguise had worked far too well, catching Cole off guard for a brief moment. His mind quickly processed what had likely led to her reaction, and with a sigh, he replied,* **"It's Cole."**


[3/9/2025 11:23 PM] Narration
Rachel blinked once before nodding. **"It will be up in 10."** She would simply walk off, knowing what to tell Malik.


[3/9/2025 11:26 PM] Cole Mercer
*[Cole nodded, patiently waiting while continuing to survey the scene around him.](https://youtu.be/M-muSqqvFio?si=oXJF02Y1ycncuLua)*

[3/9/2025 11:30 PM] Narration
Similarly to before, the atmosphere was overall muted with a few punctuated elements. Though, there was an interesting individual who stood out among the rest... A woman wearing a corpo suit, enjoying a cup of...uhh, something while she surfed a datapad in her hand. 

What is a corpo doing down here?


[3/9/2025 11:33 PM] Cole Mercer
*His gaze lingered on the woman, his mind ticking with curiosity. The woman’s sharp attire stood in contrast to the gritty energy of the Hollow Den. She seemed completely at ease in an environment that most corpo types would never dare to step into. His instincts flagged her as an anomaly. Whether she was a lost executive, some kind of corporate scout, or just a rogue trying to blend in, he wasn’t sure yet, but he planned to keep an eye on her.*


[3/9/2025 11:36 PM] Narration
As if she read his gaze, the woman took a sip of her drink and just above the brim of the cup, her eyes immediately locked with Cole's.


[3/9/2025 11:39 PM] Cole Mercer
*Cole returned his gaze to his duffle bag before settling back into a quiet watch. The brief exchange had only sharpened his awareness, he wasn’t one to drop his guard. The subtle presence of the corporate woman had raised a flag in his mind, but for now, there was little he could do but wait. His thoughts remained focused, quiet, and patient, knowing that action would come when the time was right.*


[3/10/2025 12:36 AM] Narration
10 minutes went on by and Rachel returned to Cole with 'the usual'. **"Watch it, it's hot. Don't come crying to me if you burn your mouth on it."** She warned Cole with the twirl of her index finger.


[3/10/2025 12:39 AM] Cole Mercer
*Cole nodded silently as Rachel set the plate in front of him. He glanced at the food for a moment before meeting her gaze, his expression neutral.* **“Understood.”** *he replied flatly, then reached for the plate. After picking up his utensils, he adjusted his posture slightly, pausing for a minute or two before finally digging in.*


[3/10/2025 12:47 AM] Cole Mercer
*The meal was warm and satisfying, providing the nutrients Cole needed. Alongside it was a simple glass of water. Within ten minutes, he had finished everything. As expected, it didn’t disappoint, filling, reliable, and exactly what he needed. If Rachel returned, she’d find the plate wiped clean, not a single scrap left behind. Cole is not one to waste food, let alone resources.*


[3/10/2025 4:26 PM] Narration
Rachel was not known for returning to the table of a patron unless they wanted more to eat or had some sort of complain, which was generally met with hostility and perhaps iron pressed against their temple.

Payment for the food could be processed through the small little terminal that sat on the table (near the frame of the train). Rachel usually gets bitchy when they try to pay her directly. Some issue occured here where they paid her directly and Rachel and Malik got into it.


[3/10/2025 4:33 PM] Cole Mercer
*Cole knew better than to call Rachel back. He reached for the worn terminal near the train frame, tapping through the interface. Payment processed. **13,75 micros.** No complications. No unnecessary interaction. Just the way things should be.*  

*He leaned back slightly, taking a moment to settle before deciding his next move. He glanced at his duffle bag, his gaze lingering for nearly a full minute. Thoughts churned. Lately, he had spent a lot, investments, necessities, but only recouped his losses by selling the mask. Once all the complications settled, he'd need to focus on rebuilding his funds, his life.*

[3/10/2025 4:57 PM] Narration
Rachel's back was turned towards Cole just prior and during his depature. She was serving a plate to the woman Cole had made eye-contact with him earlier. Both of them temporarily engrossed in a low conversation.


[3/10/2025 5:00 PM] Cole Mercer
*He took note of this as he passed by, his gaze lingering for just a second before he stepped out. It was uncertain when he’d return to the Hollow Den, but for now, he made his way back to the hideout, taking his time. As he walked, he remained vigilant, periodically glancing left and right to ensure he wasn’t being followed.*

And followed he wasn’t. His cosmetic alterations seem to have worked considering even Rachel, the waitress at the Hollow Den didn’t ever recognize him.

**"I heard that one of those traffickers guys was found dead in one of their own tunnels. A single bullet to the head."** Gossiped a visitor to the Metro recalled.

**"No way, they are now killing in the Metro?"**

**"Yeah, what’s worst is…"** Cole walked out of range of the conversation.

*Cole registered just enough to confirm his disguise was holding. No unwanted attention, good.*

*His thoughts sharpened as he moved.* `"This place's on the edge, won’t be long before it breaks. I need to stay ahead of the fallout. But for now, the job comes first. Everything else can wait."`


[3/13/2025 1:40 PM] Narration
Cole emerged from the Metro tunnel out onto an alleyway that was nestled adjacent from a major roadway that sitched Kapea and Littleton together. At the mouth of the entrance, a number of people loitered about. A cluster off to his left was in the process of doing drugs. A few were injecting, while others were using inhalants to get their highs. To his right, a man was leaned up against the wall, flirting with a woman who caught his attention—chatting her up while paying no mind to Cole.

These activities were pretty routine. Though, one would recommend these hooligans keep their activities more discreet. With the Vesperian Legion lurking about, one would think that— 

The sound of body on body contact came from the direction of the street—the swiping of fabric as a man, bumping into a group of prostitutes was audiable. He bounced off of one of the girls and ran into the building's wall. Staying upright, he continued running in Cole's direction (The entrance of the Metro.) 

The look on the man's wits was one of panic, sheer terror etched upon his face. Additionally, he was nearly out of breath. Whatever he was running from, it must have been for quite some time. But as fate would have it, he was not afforded the time to breathe as the moment he passed Cole. A gunshot rang out and near instantly, the man's head lurched forward and he fell onto the ground, tumbling twice before settling on the cracked ashpalt. 

Panicked screams reverberated in the narrow alley. People along the entrance scurrying off or plunging down into the tunnel to avoid any stray bullets... Cole could see that the initial man that was fleeing from someone was dead, a bullet to the back of the head leaving a grotesque wound in it's wake. Brain matter chunks littered the ground ahead of him.

[3/13/2025 1:48 PM] Cole Mercer
*Cole remained still, his expression unreadable as he processed the scene. The kill was clean, **precise.** Someone professional. His eyes flicked to the direction of the shot, scanning for movement. The chaos around him was predictable, the civilians either ran or cowered, their survival instincts overriding any curiosity.* 

*__Whoever__ pulled the trigger hadn’t fired a second shot. Either they got what they wanted, or they didn’t care about witnesses. That meant Cole had a few seconds at best to make a decision...*

*He made the smarter choice, leaving. No rush, just his **usual** walking pace. To him, this was just another Tuesday. The dead man wasn’t his concern, and whoever pulled the trigger wasn’t his problem. No reason to pry.*


[3/13/2025 1:54 PM] Luke
**"Yep, you'll do just fine..."** It was Luke's voice that came from the direction of the fired bullet. Twirling his handgun by the trigger guard with his finger. With a exaggerated gait, Luke approached the dead man. Holstering his handgun. Then, he would take the heel of his boot and push the man over onto his back from the shoulder. **"Mnmm... Garrett Fletcher... Ain't my biggest prize, but 'til I catch that rascal, you'll hafta do."**

Taking his foot off the deceased, he would focus his eye on the man's face and blink. Taking a picture.


[3/13/2025 1:59 PM] Cole Mercer
*Cole kept moving, it was the right call. In Haven Heights, survival meant knowing when to mind your own business. This was one of those times. Getting involved was pointless, and he knew better. Without a second thought, he continued toward his destination.*


[3/13/2025 2:01 PM] Luke
Luke then looked down the Alleyway towards Cole who was now a descent distance from him. **"..?"** His gaze drilled in the back of Cole's head. That guy wasn't runnin' like the rest of them..

[4/24/2025 3:53 PM] Cole Mercer
*After what felt like five minutes of quiet driving, Cole pulled the car into a discreet spot near the Metro, tucked between a rusted fence and an abandoned service shed where no one would think to look. From there, it was the rest of the way on foot.*

*With his duffle bag slung over one shoulder and his silenced handgun concealed beneath his black overcoat, Cole moved with purpose. Every step was heavy, his eyes sweeping left and right, alert to sound and movement.*


[4/24/2025 4:09 PM] Cat Bayes
*Cat was soon to follow the mercenary as she slipped out of the passenger car door, her eyes focusing back from where they drove from as if checking to see if they were followed. Feeling the tablet in her pocket, she adjusted her hoodie and quickly moved to catch up with Cole.*

*He was taking point here, Cat would just have to follow along and try not to get in his way.*


[4/24/2025 4:14 PM] Cole Mercer
*Cole didn’t look back, he didn’t need to. His pace was steady, his direction unerring. He was taking point, and the silent message was unmistakable, stay close, stay quiet. Nothing more, nothing less.*

*The Metro was crowded, as always. Cole moved through the press of bodies, avoiding unnecessary eye contact, his expression unreadable. It was still a bit of a walk to the maintenance tunnel, but once they made it there, the tension could ease, at least, that was the hope.*


[4/24/2025 4:23 PM] Cat Bayes
*Man, this guy was a man on a mission! Cat was having a little trouble moving through the crowd to keep up with the determined Cole, but as long as she kept visual on him, she'd be fine. The thing that was burning in the back of her mind was losing the tablet, her hand gripping it's silhouette creasing her hoodie pocket.*


[4/24/2025 5:15 PM] Narration
The entrance to the Metro was unassuming, hidden among a maze of twists and turns. They passed through one building, then two, and eventually three, climbing through windows and navigating around other buildings until they finally found it. Before them stood what appeared to be a staircase leading down into darkness. At the end of that darkness, there was a small speck of light.


[4/24/2025 5:32 PM] Cole Mercer
*Cole gave a small, approving nod at the sight. Without a word, he took the first step down into the dark stairwell, his movements cautious but fluid. His hand hovered near his coat, ready if needed, and his eyes remained sharp, scanning every corner as he descended toward the pale glimmer ahead.*


[4/24/2025 7:05 PM] Narration
Cole and Cat have returned to the northern portion of the Metro, which neighbored the secret tunnel that would hopefully allow them to enter Fairview.

The heavy scent of damp earth and rancid oils clung to the air, invading their senses like an unwelcome intruder. The once-familiar aroma of burning toxins that had offered a false sense of reassurance slowly dissipated. Whatever hazardous substances these corporations had carelessly poured into the ground had seeped deep into the soil, blending grotesquely with the concrete.

No one paid the two of them any mind, going about this business as usual.


[4/24/2025 7:29 PM] Cat Bayes
*Ack, she may be a haven heights girl, but she'll never get used to the smell of Metro. The way this place stunk reminded Cat that they might as well have been intruders in the territory of a pack of starving wolves, letting her guard down here - even with Cole around - would likely get her killed...or worse.*

*Like the bad smell permeating the air, she stuck close to the intimidating man beside her, making extra sure to keep a close eye on her pockets as they made their way through the decrepit cityscape.*


[4/24/2025 7:38 PM] Cole Mercer
*Cole paused briefly, lifting one arm to cover his nose. Even for someone like him, the stench was nearly overwhelming, thick, sour, and clinging to the air like a second skin. It was bad. Worse than usual.*

*But after a short moment, he exhaled through his nose, resigned. You could only flinch for so long before the rot became part of the background. With a subtle shake of his head, he lowered his arm and pressed forward, his steps steady. In a place like this, you either held your ground or you didn’t make it out at all.*

*Noticing Cole's pause, Cat looked up to him with a hint of concern behind her eyes.* **"You alright?"** *It came out before Cat even had time to think about what she was saying. Of course he was alright, the dude's probably seen hell on earth with the way he operated. Maybe it was just a force of habit, on Cat's side...did she really worry about people that much?*


[4/24/2025 7:47 PM] Cole Mercer
*Cole barely glanced her way, his voice low and clipped.* **"Just follow."** *He didn’t elaborate, there was no need. The stench was just another obstacle, nothing more. Without his mask, the smell felt different, new, unfamiliar, almost foreign. Having operated with his mask for most of his life, this was a discomfort he could’ve avoided. Adjusting to the change, however, would take time.*

The pair navigated the metro's labyrinthine corridors, each step weighed down by the oppressive energy that seeped from every shadowy corner. It felt thicker now, almost suffocating, as if the walls were closing on them.

Cole, ever-watchful, pressed deeper into the tunnel. His sharp eye, honed by countless encounters, *could* sense a shift in the air—a brewing storm. Something sinister lurked out of sight. Whatever it was, it spelled trouble, and it would be soon.

Ahead, the average behavior of the patrons and the various frequent bodies milling about was acting strangely, almost as if an invisible force was making them uneasy. They were bracing themselves for something ahead, an impending event or presence that was not within the sight of the two individuals observing the scene. Creating an atmosphere of anticipation and uncertainty, as if everyone was waiting for a significant moment to unfold, even though there was nothing there to see at that exact moment.

*Cat was quiet, her fingers brushing along the edge of the tablet hiding in her pocket before she followed alongside him. Get it together Cat, you've gotta focus!*


[4/24/2025 8:01 PM] Cole Mercer
*Cole pressed forward, though his senses were sharp and on edge. Something wasn’t right. He could feel it, an unseen shift in the rhythm of the tunnel, a pressure building behind the silence. __Trouble was close.__ His right hand moved with precision, resting on the concealed holster beneath his coat, fingers ready to draw at a moment’s notice. Without looking back, he muttered low, firm, and cold,* **“Stay behind me.”** *His body became __a shield__ between Cat and the growing tension ahead.*


[4/24/2025 8:10 PM] Cat Bayes
*Feeling the tension shift between them, and his sudden order to get behind him, Cat didn't bother asking questions. Retrieving her revolver from her back pocket, she checked to make sure it was loaded before holding it at the ready - just like how Mathias showed her.* **"..."**

*If there was something coming for them, Cat wanted to know. Activating her Cyberdeck, the sonar-like ping that was sent out cut through the darkness, highlighting anything that resonated with a signal and marking whatever could've been hiding in the darkness.*


[4/24/2025 8:49 PM] Narration
A situation was unfolding ahead. Cat's cybernetic assistance enabled her to 'cut through' the noise and locate the source of the precarious bystanders. When she did, people who could be considered at the front of the bystanders began to push out and past Cat and Cole with a sense of urgency.

Cat squinted through the chaotic throng. What lay ahead could be enough to make her heart start racing. Just 30 meters ahead, she spotted a group of about 20 heavily cybernetically enhanced individuals, their menacing figures looming like beacons in the swirling darkness of the crowd and backdrop.

Information started to decompiled, what these people were rocking were chrome that would make a cyberphyco cum. Some of their chrome couldn't even be decrypted... **These were Vesperian Legionaries. Here. In the Metro.**

They were locked in a fierce struggle with several individuals who were staunchly resisting what seemed to be an imminent arrest. Onlookers erupted in a chorus of angry shouts directed at the gleaming chrome-clad borgs, their cries of unjust detainment growing louder and more desperate.

**"...!"** *Cat's eyes widened, her hand suddenly latching onto Cole's shoulder, pulling him back before he moved any further up.* **"Fuck, fuck--! Cole, we gotta go!"** *She hissed as quiet as her panic would allow her, the urgency clear in her voice.* **"We got Legion up ahead, we gotta find a different route!"**


[4/24/2025 9:03 PM] Cole Mercer
*Cole stopped cold the second her hand gripped his shoulder, his instinct nearly had him reaching for her wrist, but her words hit fast enough to override the reflex. His gaze snapped toward her, and for the first time, his expression shifted. Not fear, but recognition, __acknowledging__ the weight of what she just said.*

***Legion.***

*He didn’t need confirmation. The way the crowd reacted, the chrome shine ahead, Cat’s tone, she wasn’t wrong. Slowly, he pulled back, guiding them both into the shadows beside a crumbling service pillar.*

**“Alright,”** *he muttered, eyes scanning the direction they came from.* **”Let's retreat. Follow me.”**


[4/24/2025 9:09 PM] Narration
Their backs firmly turned to the crowd and the looming Legion. What began as a mere trickle of individuals hastily leaving the scene rapidly escalated into a torrent. Panic rippled through the remaining onlookers as they realized the chaos unfolding before them showed no signs of abating, each heartbeat echoing the dread that something terrible would happen.

The path they had taken was now crowded with people leaving the area. The shop vendors began to catch wind of the situation and started closing up preemptively.


[4/24/2025 9:21 PM] Cole Mercer
*Cole’s patience snapped like a frayed wire. Without warning, he shoved into the throng, his arms cutting through bodies with brute force. He moved like a battering ram, one hand gripping Cat’s arm to keep her locked behind him, the other pushing aside anyone in his path with violent, purposeful strikes.*

*A man tried to stand his ground, but Cole slammed a shoulder into him to send him crashing.*

**“Move.”** *His voice was low and cold, barely more than a growl. Cole didn’t weave through the crowd. He __carved__ a path.*


[4/24/2025 9:25 PM] Cat Bayes
**"Shit, shit!"** *Cat was cursing under her breath as she followed along, desperately trying to avoid being caught underfoot by the crowd that flooded around them. Her hand still shakily gripping the hilt of her revolver - finger kept off the trigger - she watched as Cole bulldozed his way through the crowd while occasionally looking over her shoulder to make sure the Legion wasn't giving chase.*

**"Why the __fuck__ are *they* here?"** *She questioned aloud, her mind trying to process this sudden revelation.*


[4/24/2025 9:36 PM] Narration
As Cole and Cat stepped into an adjacent tunnel, a sound suddenly erupted around them, sending a jolt through their bodies. The noise was so powerful that it reverberated off the damp concrete walls, creating a cacophony that nearly deafened them in an overwhelming wave of echoing intensity. The punch behind was enough to push a subtle amount of air from their lungs. A gunshot

Before long, a cacophony of gunfire erupted, reverberating through every dark recess of this wretched hellhole, leaving no corner untouched by its relentless assault.

They had just rounded the corner, and immediately in their vicinity, in the tunnel they had just left, as a direct result of a stray bullet passing through the skull of a man, chunks of that man's brain matter were scattered across the wall. He was struck by a bullet which had the insane property of blood-thinning at extreme levels. It is important to note that the victim's head was not smashed. As he slid down across the wall before being trampled on by many people, there was a hole large enough for blood to flow like water as he dripped across the wall before falling to the ground and being crushed.

[4/24/2025 9:45 PM] Cat Bayes
**"FUCKING HELL--?!"** *Cat screamed, her voice drowned out by the orchestra the gunfire was creating. Panic was quick to wash over the crowd like a tidal wave, mass confusion ensuing with the sound of shouting and bullets whizzing. The netrunner was doing everything she could to keep her head low while also keeping up with Cole.*


[4/24/2025 9:48 PM] Cole Mercer
*Cole didn’t stop. His pace remained fast, deliberate, eyes locked forward, __every motion__ tight with purpose. As bullets tore through the air behind them, his only concern was getting out of the line of fire and keeping Cat alive.*

*He reached back once, grabbing her arm just enough to yank her forward with him when the crowd pressed too tightly.* **“Move!”** *he barked, his voice louder, cutting through the chaos like a blade.*

*He shoved past panicked bodies, shouldering through the stampede with brute force. There was no time for hesitation. No time for fear. Just the mission, and __survival__.*


[4/24/2025 9:55 PM] Cat Bayes
**"Ghh!"** *Cat didn't know what was going on, the noise overwhelming her senses and clouding her judgement. She was more than just scared, she was __terrified__ - the fear permeating the air from the other bystanders infecting like a fatal disease. It was only when Cole's hand tightly gripped her arm and pulled her along that she was able to gain some semblance of clarity in the storm, his words silencing all else around her.*

*Cat's body moved on it's own, her survival instincts firing on all cylinders. Her brain was sending only one signal to the rest of her...*

The gunshots continued to ring out through the tunnels littered with bodies behind them. They were more distant, but still equally as powerful. The crowds of people quickly thinned out, and the Metro became a ghost town underground. Any screams now would've been completely drowned out as they maneuvered and navigated.

Soon, Cole found his intended destination: a ventilation cover that hid a secret pathway. If they could remove the cover and enter before the Legionaries entered their tunnel and spotted them, it was their ticket out. The ventilation cover was dislodged slightly, allowing anyone to get their fingers behind the lip and remove it.

[4/24/2025 10:03 PM] Cole Mercer
*Cole didn’t hesitate. He dropped to one knee, reaching out with a gloved hand to hook his fingers behind the lip of the loose ventilation cover. With a firm tug, he pulled it free, the metal grating letting out a sharp, grating screech.*

*Without looking back, he shoved the cover aside and motioned to Cat with a curt nod.* **“In. Now.”** *His tone left no room for question.*


[4/24/2025 10:06 PM] Cat Bayes
*At this point, there were no questions to be had. Cat followed his order to the letter, dropping down to her knees before she quickly scrambled into the ventilation.*


[4/24/2025 10:08 PM] Cole Mercer
*As soon as Cat slipped inside, Cole followed close behind, his movements controlled. Once both feet were in the narrow passage, he reached back and gripped the ventilation cover with one hand. He pulled it back into place, aligning it just as it was before.*

The pathway they were traversing was devoid of others. The only companionship available to these two came from the ventilation ducts, fans, and the occasional catwalk lights mounted on the wall. 

The gunshots faded further with each passing moment, indicating that they had put enough distance between themselves and the bullets to breathe, even if it was only a little more.

The light at the end of the pathway grew larger and larger with each step until finally. The man-sized hole in the grate was within reach. Jansville, ladies and gents...
