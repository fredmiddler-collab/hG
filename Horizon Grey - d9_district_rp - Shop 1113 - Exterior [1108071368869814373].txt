[5/16/2023 1:04 PM] Narration
Kaedues' shift was over. Now able to breathe air that was not *as* stale. The district's ambience quickly closed in on him. A flying vehicle passed over the shop, a spotlight beaming down on the cracked asphalt. The deafening humming of its engines reverberated against the buildings and the alleyways. Kaedues' exit led him to the truck bays. Here, the company manages inbound and outbound logistics. There were a few dock hands working on loading military grade crates onto a truck with a sentry of two CCR lawmen.


[5/16/2023 1:04 PM] Danny Donovan
Danny was close behind Kaedues. With his lunch eaten and his beverage already consumed. He went ahead and stuffed his cup within the lunch box to free up a hand. With a friendly nudge of Kaedues's arm he would not stop his momentum as he went to his vehicle parked by the other employee vehicles. **"See ya tomorrow, my man."***

Danny was always on the move, always has somewhere to be. This often led to him backtracking just a bit to finish a thought.
**"Oh, and thanks for taking care of my ventilation tubes this morning."**


[5/16/2023 1:09 PM] Grace Dawson
Grace emerged from the exit. With her jacket and satchel slung across her shoulder, she began her journey to where ever she was going, in the opposite direction of the employee vehicles. To the extent of anyone's knowledge, she doesn't own a vehicle so anyone would assume she walks home.


[5/16/2023 1:10 PM] Narration
Terrence always leaves an hour early, so you can count that you will not be seeing him around this time.


[5/16/2023 1:11 PM] Narration
James on the other hand, generally stays after.


[5/16/2023 1:21 PM] Kaedues Staub
*Kaedues' balanced and moderate speed is overtaken by Danny's brisk walk. He gives a respectful nod to his coworker as he passes by and says,* **"I'll see you tomorrow. Don't mention it,"** *he assures Danny. Now, Kaedues stops in place and looks over to Grace. It's not unusual to see him stop and take in the world before heading home..*

*After a moment of pause he walks towards the dinghy van he was provided, aiming to make it home. Kaedues feels tired enough to sleep if he really wanted to... but today was easy. He's still very capable today.*

[5/16/2023 1:38 PM] Danny Donovan
Danny's vehicle was right next to Kaedues's, a emerald green coupe. Once inside and the engine started, his music in his vehicle activated. Being audible through vehicle's frame. It was not long before he gassed it and skidded out of the parking space, heading for the vehicle exit!


[5/16/2023 2:19 PM] Kaedues Staub
*Kaedues climbs onto the side of his van to open the door, since it was raised ridiculously high off the ground. After one last look down the  back of the van our gopher starts his engine and takes off.*

*Kaedues is a very calm and collected driver. As he drives, his starting and stopping is eased into. His turns are smooth and rounded like fine penmanship. His drive home will fall in line easily if the potholes don't disagree with him. While he glides across the slick gray streets of Vespera he fiddles with the radio he personally installed into the car. In the car's armrest compartment he retrieves a 6 TB Flash Drive no larger than his thumb and inserts it into the radio to begin playing some music.*

[5/16/2023 2:25 PM] Kaedues Staub
*Kaedues takes a deep breath in and out, allowing the hard day's work to pass through him spiritually. The street lamps fly over him at a steady tempo releasing a familiar droning feeling he has experienced time and time again. The neon lights passing by remind him that he has finally earned his rest after today's work.*

*Yes, it's time time to relax. He takes another deep breath as the music peters out and he no longer feels like he must work his ass off all day. That mindset can be intoxicating if not kept under control.*


[5/16/2023 4:08 PM] Narration
As Kaedues continued his road trip back to his abode, his eyes lit up! The name of the caller was displayed in the corner of his vision, *Unknown*


[5/16/2023 4:19 PM] Kaedues Staub
*Kaedeus blinks to answer the call right away. His phone number is not something he gives away to just anyone, so he gives this person the benefit of the doubt regarding suspicion.*

**"Yeah,"** *is all he says this time. Kaedues has learned the hard way not to introduce himself to people he doesn't know, or even to say generic things since even actions like that can net you some trouble with the wrong people.*

*While he talks he now reaches into his armrest compartment and pulls out a nondescript off-white colored slim package. He opens it up and retrieves a piece of coconut-flavored caffeinated gum. He tosses it into the air like he's done a hundred times before, catching it between his teeth. He tilts his head back to let the gum fall in and chews slowly; comfortably. This is all routine.*


[5/16/2023 4:59 PM] Narration
The voice resonated within his head with clarity. It was a hoarse-sounding man.

> **"Hey, man! I got your number through...whatever his name was. Listen, I heard that you're a guy that is the guy, you know? ..This is the right number right? The uh.. What do they call you?"**


[5/16/2023 5:14 PM] Kaedues Staub
**"I don't give my name to people I don't know."** *Kaedues looks at and adjusts his van's center mirror, taking a good look behind his car. Old habits die hard, after all. Then he looks forward and slows his pace...*
**"Until I know you, you'll call me the Caliber Man. What do you need done?"** *Kaedues rolls the gum around in his mouth. He stretches his fingers up and out before re-gripping the steering wheel... He takes a deep breath as his body begins to feel energized. The caffeine is very potent and already spreading to every corner of Kaedues' body.*


[5/16/2023 6:16 PM] Narration
He'd clear his throat,
> **"Well, it's rather uhh.. strange, but I assure you, it's a legitimate proposition! Have you ever considered working with... cheese?"**


[5/16/2023 6:22 PM] Kaedues Staub
*There is a long silence here, and a slight sensation of something sinister on the other end of the phone. The silence hangs in the air for so long, that for a moment it might seem like Kaedues hung up.*

**"Tell me what you need done,"** *The Caliber Man responds naturally as if he didn't just ponder how asinine the topic he was just called about was. On a work day, no less.*


[5/16/2023 7:03 PM] Narration
The man seemed to get excited!
> **"We use large blocks of cheese and turn them into magnificent sculptures for people to adore and of course eat afterwards... Problem is, one of our loader guys quit on us last minute and we need all the hands we can get loading all the cheese sculptures onto the next truck for Silicon Terrace"**


[5/16/2023 7:16 PM] Kaedues Staub
*A moment of quiet pauses. Kaedues really isn't the kind of guy to turn down a deal as long as the person supplying it does not completely rip him off.* **"__~~m~~__14 per hour of work. After 11 PM, __~~m~~__16 per hour of work. Does that sound fair to you?"**

*Kaedues blows a bubble with the gum. He then encases the bubble in his mouth and pops it with his teeth. The pop can be heard over the phone, although very muted.*


[5/16/2023 8:30 PM] Narration
The man would jump to it,
> **"14₥R? Y-yeah that would be great! Sending you the ad now."**


[5/16/2023 8:34 PM] Narration
Shortly after, the address was transferred to Kaedues. Showing up underneath the caller ID.


[5/16/2023 8:48 PM] Kaedues Staub
**"Right."** *__Click.__*

*Kaedues takes a look at the address. After a long and fruitful thought, he takes a short breath and hits the accelerator. He already knows the fastest public route to the definition just by thinking about it-- That is how much Kaedues gets around.*

**"So they want me to stack cheese...."** *He groans and changes the music coming from his flash drive.*

[5/16/2023 8:50 PM] Kaedues Staub
*He lets his caffeinated gum tumble around in his mouth to look for any remaining bits of flavor in the chew. Unlucky for him he finds nothing, so the wad of goo finds itself flying out the window of Kaedues' driver-side door. Our gopher speeds up now, 5 miles over the speed limit.*

[5/20/2023 11:18 PM] James Carter
He'd come out of the building with the pipe tightly in his hand. Looking in the direction of where his car would have been. Everything was going a million miles per minute, not even processing that Kaedues was not visible at the time over there.


[5/20/2023 11:36 PM] Kaedues Staub
***__THWOCK__***

*Kaedues' fist comes out of the FUCKING WOODWORKS to clock James straight across his jaw with absolutely zero regret.*

[5/20/2023 11:39 PM] James Carter
James would take the punch in full force. His head snapping into the direction Kaedues' fist was moving. His whole body would spin, dropping the pipe before losing his balance and hitting a rain puddle hard. His body drenched. 

To say the least, that punch caused him to see stars as he wasn't quick to get to his feet. Perhaps not knowing what just happened!


[5/20/2023 11:42 PM] Kaedues Staub
*Without skipping a BEAT, Kaedues pursues and tackles James as he goes down. Kaedues specifically grabs James' wrists and pins them to the floor.*

**"Move an inch and I'll make sure no cosmetic surgeon will be able to fix you."**


[5/20/2023 11:45 PM] James Carter
He was coming to his senses, even though Kaedues threatened him, he still was not a push over like Terrence,  **"Just wait until you're not looking you fucking bitch. You're a dead man walkin'."**


[5/20/2023 11:48 PM] Kaedues Staub
*While James is talking shit to Kaedues he spits in his mouth.* **"Speak when spoken to, you whiny pathetic excuse of an engineer. I've seen toddlers create things with more practical use than anything you have ever."** *Kaedues gets in real close.* **"Start talking."**


[5/20/2023 11:53 PM] James Carter
**"Ugha!"** He would spit and sputter, Kaedues' spit was not precise but rather messy. Sure, some got into his mouth, but a lot more coated his whole face. **"Fuck you!"**


[5/20/2023 11:56 PM] Kaedues Staub
**"I treated you like a peer for four years. __Four years__. And this is how you repay me. Sweep my job from under my feet? The play of someone who was born without a FUCKING BACKBONE!"** *The flame in Kaedues' eyes snaps to life for a moment.* **"You have beef with me, pretty boy? Speak up!"**


[5/21/2023 12:00 AM] James Carter
**"Yeah, so what if I have a problem with you?! Four years and yet you haven't gotten the fucking hint. I don't fucking want you here. Giving you all the shit jobs so that you can't take what belongs to me!"**


[5/21/2023 12:00 AM] James Carter
**"You're fucking idiot!"**


[5/21/2023 12:00 AM] Kaedues Staub
**"I'm not the one trying to kiss the ass of a brick wall in a leather chair."**


[5/21/2023 12:01 AM] James Carter
**"Yet for four years you've been kissing mine you bitch."**


[5/21/2023 12:02 AM] James Carter
**"Go ahead, act tough now. You got a good hit in but can't say you'll be so lucky next time."**


[5/21/2023 12:03 AM] James Carter
**"You think you got it all figured out, don't you? Take down me and suddenly you'll just be bending the knee to someone else. You'll never come out on top. Kill or be killed loser."**


[5/21/2023 12:10 AM] Kaedues Staub
*Kaedues plants his thumb onto James' wrist.* **"Tell me why it happened and you'll be able to come into work tomorrow."**
*His hand looks relaxed, which is strange because to James it feels like he's got a decent grip on the thing. What's that about?*

**"Why? Because I want you gone! You're highest performing engineer and it makes me fucking mad! Why are you so.....Perfect?! It irritates me! Every time I see those metrics and see you up there, miles high without breaking a sweat... How fucking else am I suppose to succeed?! Escape Haven Heights and stop being a bottom feeder like the rest of __you__?"**


[5/21/2023 11:21 AM] Kaedues Staub
*Kaedues pauses to think about what James said for a moment. Then he lets up and starts laughing to himself!* **"I bet you're a great homeowner! Probably tend to your own yard!"** *He quickly rises to his feet and jumps backwards away from James' reach. He squats down and grabs the metal pipe he had brought out.*


[5/21/2023 11:33 AM] Kaedues Staub
**"You see in me your greatest enemy. But that's your fault. Comparison is the thief of joy."** *Kaedues tosses the pipe towards James. It `metal_pipe.mp3` on the floor.* **"You won't get any better-- at __anything__-- until you compare yourself to yourself."**


[5/21/2023 11:50 AM] James Carter
He'd onto his ass, sitting up and looking up at Kaedues with pure resentment. His mouth partially agape, perhaps processing what Kaedues told him. Or perhaps thinking of ways he could really get back at him. Sneering, he would raise one arm and wipe his face with the sleeve.


[5/21/2023 12:13 PM] Kaedues Staub
**"Pick it up if you want. You can pick up that club and swing it at me if it'll make you feel like you're better. But know that when I get up tomorrow I'll still work better than you with the bruises."** *Kaedues pauses for a moment. He takes in a deep breath to clear him of the momentary guilt.* **"Or you can accept me as your peer. Like a modern man. I am literally working alongside you."**


[5/21/2023 12:20 PM] Kaedues Staub
**"The second option comes with a free punch."** *Kaedues rises to his feet. He walks over to James and extends a hand. Despite how angry he is, he still wants to include James-- for what it is worth.*


[5/21/2023 12:26 PM] James Carter
James' ugly expression deteriorated. Looking towards Kaedues hand for a long while before taking his hand to help pull himself up.


[5/21/2023 12:34 PM] Kaedues Staub
*Kaedues pulls James up and takes a step back.* **"Alright, let's get it over with."** *Kaedues turns his cheek to James. In a sense, Kaedues is trying to present himself as James' equal with the return of the blow. James has not been "rewarded" the punch. To Kaedues, it's only fair.*


[5/21/2023 12:42 PM] James Carter
Once he was on his feet. His momentum going forward, he would take this opportunity to get back at Kaedues without hesitation. He was deceiving and this was his chance now that Kaedues was on the unsuspecting end. Delivering a mean left jab to Kaedues's own jaw to get even with the guy.


[5/21/2023 12:50 PM] Kaedues Staub
*As James goes to take the punch he might notice Kaedues looking at him. All throughout the connection he is watching James.*

*The blow comes like a sledgehammer to a brick wall. Kaedues recoils from the hit and steps backwards. He parts his legs to keep his ground firmly.*

*If James really didn't pull the punch, it's gonna hurt more than he thought it might. Kaedues doesn't show it but he's built. He is muscular and dense and no matter where you hit him there isn't much give.*


[5/21/2023 12:54 PM] Kaedues Staub
*Kaedues doesn't outwardly show his pain, but DAMN did that hurt. Might even need some ice later... Kaedues reflexively touches his palm to his jaw.*

**"Alright. Now we are even. We always were before now."** *Kaedues spits at the ground.* **"Let's keep it that way."**


[5/21/2023 12:57 PM] James Carter
**"Hmph."** After shaking his hand once, James would turn his back to Kaedues. Moving to go back inside.


[5/21/2023 1:30 PM] Kaedues Staub
*Kaedues walks inside after James. For all he is concerned nothing happened out here.*

[5/23/2023 11:41 PM] Narration
The rest of the work day proceeded smoothly. Danny, true to his nature, left the site as quickly as possible. Even before Kaedues left the building. Always on the move, that Danny. James as usual stayed over and Terrence is well... An hour out.


[5/23/2023 11:50 PM] Kaedues Staub
*As Kaedues exits the building, he closes his eyes tight. When he opens them he takes a look to the left.... A lead pipe rests on the ground. It made it to the end of the day without being grabbed by some passerby.*
*Kaedues takes a step forward, looking down at the pipe. James was going to seriously beat Kaedues with that thing. He feels like it's important to really take a moment and consider that.*

*..........*

*The sound of humming vents and passing engines of cars fill up the air.*

*................*

*It's just another Monday.*
*Kaedues lets out a breath of air before walking towards his car, deciding not to be effected by something that already happened.*


[5/23/2023 11:56 PM] Grace Dawson
She exited the shop shortly after Kaedues walked towards his car. She too noticed the pipe, processing the wave of emotions stirring within her. Her eyes pan towards Kaedues. **"...Hey, Kaedues."** She took her first tentative steps towards him.


[5/24/2023 12:00 AM] Kaedues Staub
*Kaedues turns his head to look at Grace as she speaks up. When he sees that she's outside he turns the rest of his body to face her, stopping dead in his tracks.*

*Despite the fact that some shit definitely transpired today, he stands the way he always does. If not for the reddening on his face you would assume nothing is wrong. He appears calm, cool and collected like always. Is anything hiding under his stubbornly neutral expression? Who knows..*

**"Hey. What's up?"** *Kaedues calls as Grace approaches him.*


[5/24/2023 12:12 AM] Grace Dawson
**"I.."** Words escaped her, eluded her grasp. A bitter twist of longing made her wish he hadn't heard her utter his name, that he had continued on his path, disregarding her existence. Her eyes, wide and anxious, flickered about the lot as though seeking a hidden passage or perhaps a concealed truth. Shapes materialized on her lips, the ghostly echoes of unspoken words. A silent battle waged within her until finally, **"Are... are you alright?"**


[5/24/2023 12:19 AM] Kaedues Staub
*Kaedues furrows his brow at Grace for a moment to think about what she asked. He noticed it took her a while to say. Trying to be inviting, he steps toward her as he responds.* **"I can come into work tomorrow, and that's what matters."** *Kaedues lets his eyes rest on Grace's and makes a point to allow his resting face to smile.*

*Kaedues isn't dull. He knows, he understands the signs too. He just didn't want to invite the idea unless she made herself this obvious.* **"I take it you want to know?"**


[5/24/2023 12:38 AM] Grace Dawson
The very sound of his question sent an additional pang of guilt through her. Her facial muscles twitched involuntarily, her lower eyelids rising slightly and the inner corners of her eyebrows knitting together in an unspoken testament to her disquiet. The simple act of asking about his well-being had been gnawing at her from the inside, stirring her thoughts into a turbulent whirlpool all day. Moisture welled up in her eyes, finally tipping over in a silent cascade as she nodded, affirming his question.

A whirlwind of emotions swirled within her, threatening to break her composed exterior. She grappled with a strange pain that squeezed her heart, an inexplicable sorrow that didn't seem to have a source. Seeing Kaedues, always in this subdued state, seemed to strike a chord within her, causing ripples of distress...?

**"It... it unsettles me... I... I can't quite comprehend why it feels so intense. I... I didn't mean to intrude or upset you! It's just..."** She fumbled over her words, her voice barely more than a whisper. Her fingers clutched the fabric of her satchel strap against her chest, seeking some grounding in the face of her rising turmoil. Her voice was soft, almost a whisper, filled with a sincerity that echoed the confusion and concern in her eyes. **"I...I..."**


[5/24/2023 12:38 AM] Narration
There was a horn that blared down the alley into the lot they were in. It was no simple horn for cars alerting each other or getting someone's attention on the side of the road. It was intentional and had a different feeling to it.


[5/24/2023 12:38 AM] Grace Dawson
Her eyes snapped back into focus, most of her tension and pain melted away with something more stoic. Her eyes dulling as if she realized that no matter what she said, it would not matter. **"I...need to go. Sorry I...w- wasted your time."**


[5/24/2023 12:47 AM] Kaedues Staub
*As Kaedues watches Grace go through mental gymnastics just to try and speak with him, His eyebrows raise a little and his lips part. He's not used to seeing __anyone__ act like this. James, Terrence, Gavyn.. They're all caricatures in their own right, but to see vulnerability in Vespera is much rarer. Vespera looks for people like Kaedues, people who are comfortable ingraining themselves into the city's everyday.*

*He steps forward again.* **"Wait,"** *He calls out.* **"You aren't wasting my time. If you have something to say, it's good to say it."** *Kaedues' eyes have that fire behind them. He means what he says, always. Looking into his eyes anyone can see his honesty.*

*After he says that, he turns to look where the sound of the horn noise came from. Normally Kaedues wouldn't really care-- he hears horns all the time, but this one is more droning, more aggressive. He's not sure what to make of it.*


[5/24/2023 1:04 AM] Grace Dawson
Was beginning to walk away but after hearing him say that her steps faltered.  The echo of his earnest words arresting her escape. She felt the grip on her satchel strap relax as she slowly turned back towards Kaedues.

There was moments of pause, 15, 20 seconds? Eternity. Though one thing is for certain, his words did help.

**"I... I'm not good at this. Expressing... feelings., Kaedues."** she confessed, her voice resolute, imbued with an unexpected strength. **"And it's more than just a passing concern. It's... it's deeper than that. You're nothing more than a co-worker, a stranger. And it's that... it scares me."** Her eyes locked with his. She was scared. How long has she harbored these feelings? Perhaps it was when he was in danger that really surfaced them.


[5/24/2023 1:19 AM] Kaedues Staub
*Kaedues stands at distance from Grace. He isn't close to her and he isn't far away, mirroring to some regard how she could feel. When she turns to look at him again, his eyes lock onto hers like they had before. Taking in the silence as time to think, Kaedues tries to process the words behind Her words, what she really wants to say. He doesn't know.*

*Then, the real words come. He takes a long moment to think.. All the while, Grace can clearly see straight into Kaedues. In reality, his aura of mystery is one of no mystery at all. He takes another step forward; This step is intentional, not fueled by a subconscious thought.*

*Now, he opens his mouth as if to say something. He raises his right hand slightly as if to reach out, but it never goes anywhere. He looks down at Grace's mouth and then at her forehead; Momentarily breaking eye contact as he tries to form an answer to a problem he really has no experience with. In this moment, life feels foreign to Kaedues. He's confused.*

*After a moment, he closes his mouth and locks eyes with Grace again. All he can do is nod, and nod again. What's he agreeing to? Or is it acceptance? Or is he simply acknowledging that she spoke to him? It's up in the air until..*

**"Me too."** *He says.* **"I understand what you mean,"** *he then clarifies.*


[5/24/2023 1:34 AM] Grace Dawson
**"...Do you, do you __really__ understand?"**  Her voice had a sharp edge to it, a protective layer forming around her newly exposed vulnerability. It was as if her emotions were speaking through her, louder and more potent than her usual composed self. A lone tear broke free, tracing a path down her cheek. **"You're exceptional, Kaedues, at so many things. Yet, there's a voice within me, a screaming voice that says you just can't fathom just how I feel. Please, be careful."**


[5/24/2023 1:34 AM] Narration
The horn sounded once more.


[5/24/2023 1:34 AM] Grace Dawson
With that, she would walk backwards a few paces before turning to leave with a brisk pace. To escape the situation in which she put herself in.


[5/24/2023 1:46 AM] Kaedues Staub
**"........."** *Well.... It's not his place to intrude anymore. He felt something-- or at least he thought he did-- but maybe it's not enough. He watches as Grace walks away, which in of itself instills a new feeling inside him. Before, he would watch as she left out of principle. To make sure The Apprentice had everything in order. Now, he feels more compelled to think of her by name. Grace.*

*He pinches his nose bridge and looks down. A lot of thoughts are cycling through his head at once, and he takes the time to slow them down and process them all. He feels a little more introspective now.*


[5/24/2023 1:52 AM] Kaedues Staub
*Kaedues, after taking the moment to himself, just watches Grace walk away, just as he has handfuls of times before. The new connections made from that brief exchange make it difficult not to focus on just her.*
*He watches Grace's path carefully as she makes her way towards.... that horn. His curiosity is piqued and he slowly begins to accept this new thought; He is very interested in what Grace will do.*


[5/24/2023 1:58 AM] Narration
Kaedues would follow though at perhaps half the speed in which she is moving. He'd come around the corner just enough to view the source of the horn.

It was indeed a vehicle. Grace interacting with the driver of said vehicle. From there, she would move towards the driver-side rear door. Opening it. By the time she had move from the driver door, the tinted windows would have rolled up. Making it impossible to know who exactly was driving.


[5/24/2023 1:58 AM] Grace Dawson
The rear windows weren't as tinted. Once she removed her satchel, she would gaze out of the window. Looking over towards Kaedues one last time before the car slowly pulled away.


[5/24/2023 2:10 AM] Kaedues Staub
*He splashes his face again with cold water. Suddenly, Kaedues is in front of his bathroom sink and looking up at himself. The water soaks into his skin, into his hair, causing him to look distraught and tired.*

[5/26/2023 11:11 PM] Narration
What a wonderful day! On Kaedues's drive to work, he watched someone get their brains scrapped off of a wall. Apparently, death by CCR firing squad is legal! Who would've guessed!

Kaedues was pulling up into the employee lot when he could see __Danny__ of all people there before the start of the shift. Additionally, Grace and James were also idling by outside.


[5/26/2023 11:17 PM] Kaedues Staub
*Kaedues has a hard time internalizing things like that. He sees death and pain but tries not to think about it too much.*
*Kaedues' van pulls to a stop in the parking lot, and he gets out of it with an obvious determination. He jogs over to his three coworkers!*


[5/26/2023 11:30 PM] Danny Donovan
Danny was in a suit, dressed to impress. His hair more sleek than usual. The only thing that was usual was his broad grin. **"Was wondering when you'd show up."**


[5/26/2023 11:30 PM] James Carter
James wore a dress shirt and slacks. A bit less snazzy than Danny but he still attempted. He glanced over towards Danny with a __really?__ expression**"Dan, you are consistently late."**


[5/26/2023 11:30 PM] Danny Donovan
Danny shook his head, rolling his eyes with his smile widening **"It's consistent, is it not?"**


[5/26/2023 11:34 PM] Kaedues Staub
*Kaedues doesn't wear his usual getup to work today. Instead, he wears a jet black tank top with baggy camouflage pants. He wears his usual belt and combat boots, but seeing this much of Kaedues is rare for anyone.*
*And boy, does he have arms.*

[5/26/2023 11:35 PM] Kaedues Staub
*Kaedues has his hands on his hips.* **"Seeing you here on time makes me think good things will happen today, Danny."**


[5/26/2023 11:45 PM] Grace Dawson
Completely out of her usual outfit as well. Upon her head, she allowed her hair to flow down instead of being pinned. She had a lot of hair. Going all the way down to her thighs. Additionally, she wore a all black dress that was tight around her waist and the skirt to it flared out, complimenting her hips. Custom fitted to her, that means quite a bit of micros was spent. To complete the outfit, she wore a silver necklace. Within her hands in her lap was the case holding the weapon securely. She wore a complacent grin on her face seeing Kaedues.


[5/26/2023 11:45 PM] Danny Donovan
**"Ah, me being here early means I know that its going to be a long day."** He'd laugh, **"We are riding a AV to the execs offices. Hope you guys are not afraid of heights?"**


[5/26/2023 11:45 PM] James Carter
**"You shitting me? I ain't scare of heights."**

[5/27/2023 12:07 AM] Kaedues Staub
**"Nothing to fear here."** *Kaedues replies as he looks at Danny. Kaedues' face and outfit mirror what he presents himself as. In fact, this outfit choice is not for convenience. Kaedues exposes his arms on purpose to show his dedication both to routine and to difficult work. To have a body this powerful and flexible it must be kept working under a large variety of conditions. He has a belt of tools around his waist to show his diverse experience in the work field. He wears his combat boots as personal flair and to show that he does not mind getting dirty.*

*Kaedues looks everyone else up and down.* **"You all look like you want to wine and dine."**


[5/28/2023 3:12 PM] Danny Donovan
Danny laughed, shaking his head. **"Oh if only I was up to wine this early in the morning."** He would look at his watch, getting a rough estimate on when the AV was suppose to come around.


[5/28/2023 3:12 PM] James Carter
He would roll his eyes at Kaedues' attire. Though, his comment could easily be ignored. **"This guy."**


[5/28/2023 4:20 PM] Kaedues Staub
*Kaedues doesn't say much after this point. It's clear to him that today won't be the usual kind of work, so he's comfortable waiting until something needs to be done.*


[5/28/2023 5:45 PM] Narration
Within a few moments, a droning sound could be heard increasingly resonating throughout the employee parking lot. Before long, an AV would slowly fly over the tops of the buildings that enclosed the area. It was a expensive craft, clearly belonging to a company no doubt. It would circle the lot a few times before deciding on a landing spot. The sound wasn't deafening, but certainly was loud as it descended. 

Once it touched down, the engines spooled down into an idle. The door located towards the center of the body would raise upwards, steps unfolding and meeting the ground square.

[5/28/2023 5:48 PM] Danny Donovan
Danny pulled his wrist from his face and would situate his suit jacket. From there, Danny began his journey towards the aircraft. **"That's our ride."**


[5/28/2023 5:48 PM] James Carter
**"Not everyday you get to ride in one of these."** He admitted, **"This must be the corpo lifestyle so many people are chasing. Heh, fucking prem."** He was second to follow Danny, clearly drooling over the prospects of reaching such heights, figuratively and literally.


[5/28/2023 6:02 PM] Kaedues Staub
*The Caliber Man watches as the AV slowly but surely descends upon the likes of him and the rest of Shop 1113. With a breath his anxiety vanishes from his mind, and he begins walking towards the aircraft.*
*Kaedues pauses for a moment, as if spacing out. He looks back at Grace for a second, as if making sure she's there. Then he keeps on keeping on.*


[5/28/2023 7:08 PM] Grace Dawson
Grace felt a mixture of excitement and fear. She was excited to be meeting these people, but she was also scared that she wouldn't be able to live up to their expectations. She felt like she was on the edge of something new and exciting, but also something that could potentially be overwhelming. 

She had to look down at her own feet. Was she capable of taking this step forward to potentially reshaping her life? Or perhaps she stepped into the graveyard herself. Did it matter? Ultimately, she looked forward with a small vigor. Moving to the AV.


[5/28/2023 7:24 PM] Narration
With the entire crew inside of the AV what they were greeted with were seats of the middle class. Small tables adorned corners with ports so that members riding could jack in and utilize the AV's many features. It was a nice ride for certain.


[5/28/2023 7:26 PM] James Carter
It was James who looked like he was about to drool, again. He would gently touched the fabrics of the seats. Running his fingers along them seams, taking in all of the decor with his optics.


[5/28/2023 7:28 PM] Grace Dawson
There was just too much space on the ship for a little Grace. She looked around the interior like a lost puppy before taking a seat in the back corner where no one else seated themselves for the time being.


[5/28/2023 7:28 PM] Danny Donovan
He got in and sat down like it was just another normal Tuesday.


[5/28/2023 8:27 PM] Kaedues Staub
*Kaedues stands up in front of them all, holding onto two durable straps attached to the ceiling of the AV. He looks only out the front windows....*

*Then clearing his throat....* **"What are we going to tell them, you guys?"** *He looks back, side eyeing the group.*


[5/28/2023 8:28 PM] Kaedues Staub
*The way he pronounces the question is very rhetorical. Like they should already know the answer.*


[5/28/2023 8:48 PM] James Carter
**"Simple, show them all the bells and whistles the gun has."** He'd look around like it was a stupid question. Not getting the rhetorical side of it.


[5/28/2023 8:52 PM] Danny Donovan
He'd shake his head, chuckling at James.


[5/28/2023 9:14 PM] Kaedues Staub
**"We're going to tell them, this gun kicks ass and takes names."**
*Kaedues turns to look at the group. His singular side-eye (a bombastic side eye, if you would be so inclined) burns with Kaedues' own determination and perseverance. He turns to look at James. For a moment, there's a hint of genuine anger in his eyes, but it's flushed out almost immediately.*

*With the flush comes the pang of a headache. Kaedues lets go of one of the straps from the ceiling and clutches his head.* **"Rrh--"** *He groans softly.*


[5/28/2023 9:17 PM] Narration
The AV's engines would spool up and before they knew it the vehicle took flight.


[5/28/2023 9:19 PM] Kaedues Staub
*Kaedues takes a moment to regain his composure. He'd take another few to think straight again. After that, he stands tall, looks forward, and prepares for the flight ahead.*

[5/30/2023 12:11 AM] Narration
And Kaedues would feel like that for the rest of the day. Perhaps it was a feeling of emptiness, a void he couldn't fill no matter what he did? Everything was fine? Just... normal. Was this normal? A day without much to do? There was nothing for Kaedues to do for 4 hours....Nothing.


[5/30/2023 12:13 AM] Kaedues Staub
*Kaedues exits the building and waits right outside for Grace, like he had alluded to earlier. He looks down at the ground while she gets ready to go, thinking to himself. He feels like.....*

*.....He feels a message coming to him. One in a language he doesn't understand, like a greater power talking down only for their words to be scrambled before reaching Kaedues' ears. He doesn't let this feeling swallow him though.*


[5/30/2023 12:21 AM] Narration
Danny had left, James had left and quite frankly, the lot was empty aside for Kaedues. It was a while before she came out of the shop.

[5/30/2023 12:25 AM] Grace Dawson
In the end, she emerged from the door. There was an automatic locking of the door due to the fact that it was after hours. After heaving a heavy sigh, she turned her attention to the parking lot. Having been unaware of his presence for a considerable amount of time, he went unnoticed until she turned toward the parking lot. She looked over at him. Her lips parted as though she was anticipating something? Words, perhaps an action?


[5/30/2023 12:29 AM] Kaedues Staub
*Kaedues steps away from the wall towards Grace. He uncrosses his arms and points his head in the direction of his work provided van.* **"Do you want to go somewhere with me?"** *He offers before turning his body towards his van too.* **"Daylight is still burning."** *He leaves it at that, for now.*


[5/30/2023 12:36 AM] Grace Dawson
Her heart hammered in her chest, mirroring the rhythm of the faint hum emitted by the facility's power generators. This was it, exactly what she had been working up the courage to ask him. But now that it was asked, she hesitated. A moment passed, an eternity in the rush of her thoughts.

**"Y-yeah,"** she stuttered, a tiny smile playing at the corners of her lips, her cheeks still carrying a tinge of pink. **"That... that sounds good, Kaedues. Let's... let's make the most of the daylight."**

She took a step towards him, taking a deep breath to calm her racing heart. It was a small step, but it felt like the beginning of something new, something exciting.


[5/30/2023 12:40 AM] Kaedues Staub
*Kaedues walks over to his van ahead of Grace. Today, he can hear the distinct sounds of his footsteps and Grace's as well. Why is it so quiet today? Is it foreboding or is it just.... a nice day? Maybe the silence is a sign that things will go well.*

*Once he makes it to the van, Kaedues looks back at Grace and opens the door for her.*


[5/30/2023 12:42 AM] Grace Dawson
She would accept the gesture. She couldn't help but smile as she stepped up into his vehicle.


[5/30/2023 12:51 AM] Kaedues Staub
*Kaedues follows after her. He closes the door behind himself once he's inside.*

*Kaedues looks into the back of his van.... For the audience's sake.*
*What does Kaedues' van look like inside? From the outside looking in you can see his driver seat and passenger seat. Greatly positioned mirrors and windows. A sizeable glove box and an armrest that has a compartment inside. Dangling from his rearview mirror is a rusty necklace. At the end of the necklace, there is a hard drive professionally attached.*

*Beyond the driver and passenger seats there is a grand sense of emptiness. There is a singular light that does not quite illuminate everything. Toolboxes litter the floor, but tools do not. It's easy to see that Kaedues knows to put things away, but nothing really has a place within his... mobile home.*

*Within the grand empty space that is the back of Kaedues' van is a mattress. It's just above a twin size, being able to comfortably fit two people... or one person in the victory pose. The van smells faintly of motor oil but is otherwise sterile. Somewhere not quite noticeable, the sound of an automatic air freshener circulates the smell of walnut throughout everything.*

-

*The door on his van is closest to the passenger seat, so Kaedues waits for Grace to get situated before moving around and potentially bumping into her or something like that.*


[5/30/2023 1:03 AM] Grace Dawson
She would situate herself behind the seats so he could enter. Having only been in his van once, nothing came to mind at the time. However, the atmosphere for her this time was different. This was __Kaedues's vehicle__. Taking in the scents, the layout, the mattress. All these things come to mind. Clearly, not what she is accustomed to, but it held a charm she could not quite explain.


[5/30/2023 1:09 AM] Kaedues Staub
*Kaedues appreciates the gesture. He steps further inside to seat himself at the wheel before looking over to Grace.* **"So... Where do you want to go?"** *He asks simply. He has some places but is curious as to what she might suggest.*


[5/30/2023 1:14 AM] Grace Dawson
Grace's expression was priceless. Appearing to show signs of guilt, perhaps embarrassment?  **"Honestly, I did not think I would get this far."** She admitted. **"I am only familiar with places in Fairview."**


[5/30/2023 1:16 AM] Kaedues Staub
**"Well...."** *Kaedues leans back towards the wall opposite of the door.* **"You could show me places you remember from Fairview, or...."** *Kaedues thinks to himself.* **"I could show you what I do when I have off time."**


[5/30/2023 1:26 AM] Grace Dawson
She thought about his proposals. Weighting her options. It was true that she could show him around Fairview, but that would expose just how much she __doesn't__ get out. Besides, this was a perfect opportunity for Grace to learn more about him on a personal level. **"I'm fine with seeing what you do."**


[5/30/2023 1:30 AM] Kaedues Staub
**"Okay,"** *Kaedues nods.* **"When I get off work, I usually look for more work."** ( 🤤 🤤 🤤 ) **"When I can't find anything I usually go freerunning. You wanna try it out?"** *He asks the question like it's natural. Hey Grace, you've done crazy parkour before right? Scaling buildings and all that?*


[5/31/2023 12:03 AM] Grace Dawson
**"Freerunning?"** She looked at Kaedues quizzically. More confused to hear this sort of thing come from him. Not like they hung out or anything before. **"I— maybe?"** She had heard the term before, but did not know the exactly definition. **"Is this some sort of, exercise?"**


[5/31/2023 9:35 PM] Kaedues Staub
**"The best exercise you can get,"** *Kaedues responds happily.* **"Climbing, vaulting, sprinting, sliding and jumping. As fast as you can."** *He leans back in his chair, smiling up at the roof of his van.*


[5/31/2023 9:50 PM] Grace Dawson
Grace considered it, on one hand, she was far from athletic. On the other if it was something he __truly__ enjoyed, This could be her moment to step out of her comfort zone and share in his passion. Was she ready to dive into his world? To understand him better and maybe, just maybe, discover an unexpected love for it? 

However, there was the flutter of fear, thinking about the potential scraps and— **"I'm willing to try it.. Where do you go to do it?"**


[5/31/2023 10:01 PM] Kaedues Staub
*Kaedues takes note of Grace's hesitation and notes that this is likely the first time for her.* **"There's an abandoned building near my place."** *He comments. He turns to face her, still smiling. Now shifting his car into gear, Kaedues reassures Grace.* **"If you can't handle it, no problem. We can always fall back on something else."** *Kaedues buckles up and checks his mirrors.* **"Do you like coconut, Grace?"**

**"Seems like no one is."** *Kaedues says begrudgingly before pulling out.* **"If it's too much for you, I understand. Not exactly the safest location, but you can't really climb public buildings without the CCR giving you an earnest ass whooping."** *Kaedues safely pulls out of Shop 1113 and drives down the road.* **"Just let me know if you aren't game."**

**. . .**

*A minute or two passes as Kaedues aligns himself with the road home. As they roll down the road Grace may begin to notice that Kaedues has __pinpoint perfect__ driving skill. Kaedues Staub, the Caliber Man, drives as if his brain comes with a fucking routing system. His turns are smooth, he never makes abrupt stops, and he accelerates/decelerates smoother than butter.*

*To break the silence, Kaedues thinks of a really nice topic of choice. Let's warm up Grace with some small talk to break up the monotomy of work life.*
**"....So why'd you decide to get into weapon engineering?"**
*Good job Kaedues. You had one job.*


[5/31/2023 11:02 PM] Grace Dawson
Her eyes were set on the roads, watching as Haven Heights rolled by like a smooth and calming background. Then the question came up. For some reason, she seemed flustered by it. Her cheeks turning light pink as she looked out the side window away from Kaedues. **"It's a bit of a family tradition, I suppose. I heard that my granddad was an engineer, same as my dad. I had nothing better to do so here I am."** Vague. Very vague.


[5/31/2023 11:09 PM] Kaedues Staub
*Kaedues listens closely and patiently as Grace describes her answer. While she talks, he uses his right arm to fiddle with the USB stuck in his radio. While Grace talks, a song starts playing. Kaedues set it to a low volume before allowing said song to start so Grace is not interrupted.*

**"...You're not alone. Many of the people that worked in the shop before you had the same reason to work. I'm __pretty sure__ my mom and dad had blue collar jobs too."** *Kaedues clears his throat.* **"More importantly, __are you happy__ with this line of work?"**

**"......"** *Kaedues lets that response hang in the air. At this point, Kaedues and Grace enter a tunnel that darkens the atmosphere. The nightly interior of Kaedues' van is only briefly illuminated by mounted lights within the tunnel.*

**"That's okay, Grace."** *The light moving across Kaedues' face allows Grace to see smaller details not evident before. Scars are illuminated on Kaedues' face, and his bone structure becomes more evident. It even looks like Kaedues may have had a distant nose injury.*
**"No one knows right away. I didn't know, either."** *The end of the tunnel seems bright compared to the rest of it.* **"Jobs are jobs to me. I'm not sure what they mean to you though."** *Kaedues glances over at Grace for a moment.* **"Give it a few years I say. But I want you to know, I committed to the MK-25 because I saw it in you. Danny does too, I think. You are exceptional, Grace."**

*Kaedues slowly turns back to the road. His brow begins to furrow as though he is confused about something.*


[5/31/2023 11:54 PM] Grace Dawson
Grace drew in a deep breath, her gaze steady, though her heart pounded fiercely within her chest.

**"...__You__"** she began, her voice soft yet filled with a raw sincerity over the inner workings of the van, **"...You know, I've been mulling over a question that keeps __tugging__ at my curiosity. I'm trying to understand the essence of you... There's a depth in you, an __enigma__, that I've been trying to grasp... I've spent countless nights, lost in thoughts, trying to decipher the intricate puzzle that is __you__."**

Her gaze cut towards him, sharp and probing, yet full with a profound curiosity that held an undeniable warmth.

**"...__Your__ reactions, __your__ choices... they've never ceased to amaze me. That time when everything was teetering on the edge, when your __job__ was a breath away from crumbling... If it was merely a __job__, then why did you grapple so __ferociously__ to keep it from slipping away?."**

Her voice trailed off for a heartbeat before she returned to her initial question, its implications growing heavier.

**"If it was just a mere __job__, then __why__? Why did you confront the storm, face the raging winds with a unyielding resolve? Why, in that chaos, did you choose to fight so relentlessly for this __job__ What pushed __you__ to go above and beyond, to stake everything on a single throw of the dice? And__ you__ stood up for __me__, jumped into the fray when you could have easily stayed out of it..."**


[6/1/2023 12:19 AM] Kaedues Staub
*Kaedues listens to Grace's words and intentions. They come rushing in, and he invited them. Her first words perturb Kaedues... but why? He asks himself for a moment. Why do they bother him to hear? Is she being invasive? No. Kaedues dispels thoughts like this; He does not mind what she thinks of him.*
*Truthfully, Kaedues feels disgruntled by a feeling of understanding washing up from underneath Grace's dialogue.*

*His fingers quickly tighten around the steering wheel as her words permeate the air of calm Kaedues invited. He begins to glance towards his mirrors, expecting something to be there.... and relieved not to find anything. To Grace, his routine checking of his mirrors is the same as they were up until this point.*

**"I...."** *Kaedues chokes out. His voice faltered for a moment and he clears his throat. Kaedues' van exits the tunnel, and a series of abandoned buildings can be seen on their right side.*
*Kaedues continues to listen to Grace and her questions. As she asks them, he asks himself too. Normally, people would know the answer to these questions. There is a long, uncanny silence as Kaedues considers the reasons he did those things.*

**. . .**

*Kaedues stops checking his speedometer, now only focusing on his mirrors and the road. The van passes by the buildings entirely. Why does he keep looking? Traffic is normal. Kaedues' eyes see ordinary days. However, something about the kind of dialogue Grace is deciding to speak draws something up within Kaedues.... A feeling he is not familiar with. The veins in Kaedues' muscular forearms pop out as his grip on his steering wheel tightens.*


[6/1/2023 12:23 AM] Kaedues Staub
*That feeling, rooted deep down within him, begins to work its way up like a bad lunch. As his brain begins to regurgitate this feeling, Kaedues stops doing other natural things. He stops blinking, stops breathing. He stops thinking about anything except the road in front of him. He's driving alone, talking to himself. The feeling rises up and out of him without conscious volition.*

**"It's the only way I can keep going."**

........

*Kaedues is going 5 miles over the speed limit, like usual. He has long since passed the abandoned buildings he said they would visit. Within, he feels like he just lied to himself.*

Kaedues' si̷̐̕tuational awareness was flawless. Everything went smoothly. The drive was like a well-oiled machine, everything working together in p̶͒̾erfect harmony, like a symphony con̷̤̏ď̵̇ucted by an experienced maestro. Grace's q̴̍͛û̴͘estion struck a chord, similar to the sound of destructive interference on which this symphony was composed. Why mu̶͆̀ust she do this?

It was as if Kaedues' world changed around him. Where was he? He was no longer in the lane he believed he was in. He was not following traffic, he was driving against traffic. His speed was not 5 over the speed limit, he went 50 over the speed limit. Miraculously it was a car that collided. It would be a building that was unavoidable at this time. Should he swerve, he could lessen the direct impact. Would he turn to where he would take the brunt of the impact, or would he sacrifice Grace out of self preservation? Perhaps confronting it head-on was the right option? Maybe neither of them deserve to live? Would anyone care? The situation was similar to a rock and a hard place; however, instead of a choice between two difficult options, it was a choice between two impossible ones.


[6/1/2023 1:20 AM] Kaedues Staub
*It was like a switch flipped. Kaedues snaps to life and breathes in desperately. Kaedues' acute awareness is only enhanced by the realization that he is about to die. To Kaedues, the seconds it would take for him to make this decision slow... but not by enough. He doesn't have enough time to think, only to choose.*

*In the infinitely small moment he has, Kaedues' priorities are questioned. He __needs to live. He needs to work and to work he needs to live. That is all there is to it, Kaedues.__ `But you don't have that choice to make. You never did.`*

*`Kaedues swerves right. He chooses to protect Grace. Is it because he is infatuated with her? Is it because she is drawing something out of him? Is it because it is the right thing to do? He doesn't know.`*
*`After that, he chooses to protect himself, only evident by allowing himself to collide with the other vehicle instead of the building. There is nothing short of instinctual decision making here.`*

The oncoming vehicle's horn was the last sound heard. Everyone felt anxiety, hopelessness, dread. Grace, the other driver....Kaedues?

Pain, it was pain. It can bring up feelings of grief, anger, fear, and anxiety, all of which can make the pain seem even more unbearable. Pain can also lead to feelings of isolation and loneliness, as it can be difficult to relate to others who have not experienced the same level of physical or emotional pain. But this was not the pain Kaedues experienced. It was a physical, agonizing pain. At first, it was numbing but gradually it became something much worse. This pain sensation should be enough to awaken Kaedues.

*`Kaedues jolts to life again, his thoughts running wild and chaotically. His body immediately compells itself to move, to assess his situation and try to move forward. He can't. He can't move.. He looks up and around with his head, his neck. At least that works.`*

*`Thinking hurts. He tries not to think too much. As he looks around, he sees a car... not his car. His arm is stuck underneath it. He sees his van, further behind him. What was he doing?`*

*`Then again, some uncouth feeling rises up from within him. Only this time, he is conscious enough to feel it come out. He `__`relives`__` the situation he went through up until this point. He was... driving somewhere. Driving to do something. With someone. He was talking to himself. No, he was listening to someone...`*

*`Grace.`*

*`Suddenly, it hurts more. From outside, from inside, from his head. A feeling of coldness washes over him but is completely and entirely thrown to the side by the pain surging through him. The coldness is also met with an intense, uncomfortable, unbearable heat emanating from somewhere near him.`*

*`Move, Kaedues. Move. Move.` __You can't move. Your arm, remember?__ `It's too late to stay attached to those things. It's too late. So Kaedues tugs at his arm, trying to free it from the rubble of the car. It feels excruciatingly painful, more than Kaedues has ever experienced before. Or... does it?`*

*`Kaedues realizes only now that he doesn't feel his forearm, or his elbow... He takes a moment to relay that information back to himself. Now's not the time to think about that though. He turns over slowly. The pain surging through his every muscle makes him think his body is ripping apart. But now is not the time for those thoughts. He tries with all of his might to lift any part of the car upwards and slide his arm out.`*


[6/1/2023 2:48 PM] Narration
The vehicle gave way just enough that the arm was able to slide out of the frame. A bone protruding from the skin was crushed on his forearm. His hand on the __other hand__ was unrecognizable. Mangled was the most accurate word to describe it.


[6/1/2023 3:00 PM] Kaedues Staub
*`Kaedues feels every inch of his body and mind telling him to stop. Lay down, recover your strength. Go to sleep. He can't... He can't listen to himself right now; It is as if something that had welled up within him is piloting his body without his consent.`*

*`He keeps going. The pain makes everything feel like it is happening in slow motion. Slow, agonizing, horrible time crawls just as fast as Kaedues can think. He tries to get up, tries not to think about the condition he's in. He tries... and falls down. The drop was only a few inches and yet it knocks the wind out of his lungs. He breathes in deep-- another bad idea. Even breathing feels like dying. He tries to calm himself and assess his surroundings again.`*

*`He looks forward. For a moment, it looked like he saw a figure in front of him. Someone wearing his favorite kind of boots. He uses his left arm to balance himself and slowly rises to his feet. What happened?`*
*`Grace was in the van. He turns around to look at his van. What kind of condition is it in?`*

*`He doesn't have enough time to accurately process it. As he gets up, it becomes evident to Kaedues that he's lost quite a lot of blood. Moving around makes Kaedues feel dizzy and nauseous. He wants to vomit but has nothing to throw up. His throat tastes like blood. His nose smells like blood. He clenches both of his hands, or at least he thinks he does, to try and let the pain keep him active.`*


[6/1/2023 3:44 PM] Narration
The crash site was a scene of utter destruction. The van was completely destroyed, with the cabin engulfed in flames. The engine was leaking gasoline, and the surrounding area was littered with the remains of the vehicles. It appeared that while Kaedues was unconscious, local people had taken advantage and looted the vehicles. A body had been slashed in half between Kaedues and his van. Their insides made for an excellent paint as their limbs twisted like scrap metal.


[6/1/2023 11:17 PM] Kaedues Staub
*`Kaedues looks around at the scene in front of him. The smell of iron and ash permeate the dark and unforgiving atmosphere he woke up to. Any semblance of optimism, or even realism, is slipping from Kaedues. He sees the world in contrasted frames. Nothing is correctly in focus. Everything that is bright is too bright, and everything that isn't bright is completely incomprehensible.`*

*`The body. Kaedues clenches his fists and begins to trudge over to the horrible scene in front of him. Looking at the body, Kaedues feels torn himself. He caused that. When Kaedues stands over the body, what does he see?`*


[6/1/2023 11:25 PM] Narration
He saw a man's body parts. The smell of human insides assaulted the air nearby. Large swaths of the person's body appear to have been crushed. Blood streaked from where he was split toward the direction of Kaedues' van. Potentially a pedestrian who was crushed from his vehicle's rollover.


[6/1/2023 11:34 PM] Kaedues Staub
*`...`*
*`Kaedues turns away in disgust and horror. Earlier this week, Kaedues witnessed equally horrible things and managed to turn a blind eye. Not now. There's a feeling Kaedues is wrought with. A constricting, hollow feeling that eats you up inside. Looking at that man, Kaedues wonders where he was going.`*

*`Kaedues' knees buckle for a moment and he begins to gag and wretch.. but nothing comes out. Kaedues feels disgusted at the sight and at himself, but can't vomit. It won't come out.`*

*`After a moment, he starts to walk forward again. He squeezes down hard with his hands and plants his feet like he's teaching himself to walk again. All you have to do is take the next step. Keep your eyes open. Keep going. Kaedues' pace picks up if only a little and he manages to get to the lone door of his van. He looks inside.`*

Flames inside would rake at his skin. Burning hot as the fabrics and slow burning materials cooked, making it nearly impossible to see inside without optical chrome. There was smoke pouring out of the cracked frame and the windows. The door was ajar, could have been Grace exiting, getting pulled out or worst, she was ejected.


[6/1/2023 11:45 PM] Kaedues Staub
*`Kaedues looks at the ground for any signs she had gotten away. It hurts to breathe, to think, to feel. Kaedues is still running on borrowed time-- He can feel the energy leaking out of him like a battery left out in the sun.... but he can't stop. That horrible, grotesque feeling pushes his legs forward and pumps the blood in his heart. Kaedues begins to move away from his van outward. As if he were the one trying to get away from it.`*


[6/1/2023 11:57 PM] Narration
Kaedues ventured away from the wreckage. The path of least resistance was the sidewalk adjacent to the accident. Though, all he would see are pedestrians ignoring the carnage. Getting on their business and paying Kaedues no mind. Beyond them was a line of buildings that would hinder anyone who wished to escape. There was no blood trail in his direction. 

It could be that Grace made it through unharmed, but the likelihood is extremely low. Despite being near the sidewalk, Grace failed to show.


[6/2/2023 12:00 AM] Kaedues Staub
*`Kaedues looks back at the scene he stepped away from. His eyes falter but with that being said he carefully looks over the scene he walked away from. Is there anything he hasn't seen?`*


[6/2/2023 12:03 AM] Narration
Now that he was viewing the scene from a different angle, he spotted what would appear to be a second pool of blood that was slowly draining into the city's drainage system. It was over by the curb. Whoever this was must've hit the curb and hard. Their body however was not to be found. Perhaps there will be clues if he approached it?


[6/2/2023 12:05 AM] Kaedues Staub
*`Kaedues makes haste to move towards the pool of blood. He keeps his head on a swivel, on the lookout for anything moving even slightly. The bright lights from the fire make that difficult and so it takes longer.`*

*`If Kaedues does not see anything, he looks again. And if he doesn't see something the second time, he looks again.`*


[6/2/2023 12:07 AM] Narration
There was a pair of glasses 4 meters from the blood pool. Those were Grace's glasses. The lens weren't just shattered, they were missing. The frame bent, did she hit her head?


[6/2/2023 12:12 AM] Kaedues Staub
*`Kaedues jogs over to the glasses now, and the pool of blood. The feeling of his feet hitting the ground sends cold and painful trills through his bones.`*

*`Kaedues tries to call out Grace's name, but he can't. His voice won't manifest from inside him. He goes back to looking.. First at the curb and along it, and then around the area where the glasses landed. Now he knows she was here, but how far did she fall? Or fly?`*

It was at this time that some CCR lawmen showed up in their Ion Enforcer. Behind them was an ambulance. Neither had sirens blaring. Just another day for them.

*`Kaedues thinks to himself now, about why he is pursuing this woman. The apprentice. Why IS he going to such lengths for her? He still hasn't asked himself and he's looking for her so desperately.`*

*`For a moment, Kaedues thinks about it. He has a good reason to leave. His arm is mangled and he's losing energy. While he thinks, he kneels down. He takes off his shirt. With his teeth, he rips off a section of it and ties it to his bicep, tighter than he is comfortable with. He does that in one fluid motion and the pain surges through him like a punch straight to the nose. Jesus fuck that hurts. Why do this? Why is she important to you, Kaedues?`*

*`Time to pull up your diaper, Kaedues. You know very well that's not the only step. He undoes his belt from his waist and slips it underneath the tightly bound cloth. Why do her questions create this disconnect within you? What about the scene unfolding upon you is so different from anything else you do? Deep breath in. Here we go, here we go, here we--`*

*`Twist. It feels like his arm is being sawed off just like that. The pain is somehow overbearing and dull at the same time. The pain is supplemented with a passing thought. Her questions need answers.`*

*`Kaedues picks up Grace's glasses and slip them in his back pocket. He gets up and follows the footprints.`*

Kaedues traced the fading footprints, the diluted stain of blood smeared on the unforgiving asphalt. Its once vibrant hue was waning, a metaphor for the evaporating memories of the woman who had never truly shared his space! Dismiss the blood, let her go. The vanishing prints were a stark symbol of her loss, her ephemerality!!!

Look at yourself Kaedues! What has driven you to this futile chase? To pour so much energy into a pursuit that only leads to a void. You're lost, utterly lost, all because of this phantom woman. Can you see how she had disrupted your equilibrium, upset your meticulously crafted routine?

She's vanished, Kaedues, dissolved into the ether. Everything is unravelling around you, all the fault of this one, elusive woman. How can you let this happen? How can you allow yourself to be so catastrophically thrown off your perfect course?

Think of how much you can get done without her asking those meddling questions all the time. Do not bite the apple, Adam; for it contains truths you are not yet capable of understanding.*

*`But that's not everything. Kaedues flexes his right arm, causing a pain so unbearable it almost makes him fall down all over again. Bite the apple, Adam! You are imperfect! Who ever told you to work until your fingers don't bend? Look at the world around you!`*

*`While the phone rings, Kaedues is walking away from the scene of it all. The distant sound of burning rubber invades his senses. The constant, droning pain is horrible. He is learning to take it, but only by distracting himself. Once he is far enough away, he turns to look at the fire.`*

*`And there it is, again. The fire that would once have looked orange to Kaedues is suddenly a mix of brilliant white with deep oranges and reds. He hates this rubbery smell in the air, but even that is foreign to him. This distaste, this disgust, for what he is seeing and feeling.`*

> **"Hey Kaedues, not often I receive calls from you. Whatcha need?"**


[6/3/2023 8:44 PM] Kaedues Staub
*`"....I'm sorry to call like this, Dan. I'm in need of a ride if you can give it." Kaedues sounds somber, which is new for everyone including himself. He sounds sad or distraught but more than that he sounds like SHIT. Kaedues' voice sounds like he just took a long trip down the garbage disposal.`*

*`"It's important. If you come over here I don't know how long you will be out for."`*


[6/3/2023 9:11 PM] Danny Donovan
There was pause before Danny spoke up.
> **"I'm in Fairview right now. Send me your coordinates."**


[6/3/2023 9:13 PM] Kaedues Staub
*`Kaedues sends his coordinates directly to Danny. A conventional, hearless voice inside him tells him to spill the beans about his crash, but he can't. The words get stuck in Kaedues' throat, completely inaudible. He swallows hard like he just took a dry pill.`*

*`He's prepared to wait until Danny arrives.`*


[6/3/2023 9:30 PM] Danny Donovan
It would take Danny more than 45 minutes to get to Kaedues' coordinates. But ultimately he did. His car heading in the opposite direction when he first spotted Kaedues. Entering the intersection nearby, he would pull a u-turn before driving up towards the curb where Kaedues was. He observed Kaedues' arm when he inched closer with his vehicle. 

Once Danny reached a complete stop, he would step out of his car a bewildered by the sight and state of Kaedues. **"Kaedues, what happened?!"** He said as he moved around the front of his vehicle, closing the door behind himself.


[6/3/2023 10:11 PM] Kaedues Staub
*`45 Minutes..?`*
*`Kaedues had wound up sitting down and waiting for around an hour. To Kaedues, it feels like something unspeakable has entered his mind. Something that whispers tantalizing secrets to Kaedues, knowledge he does not and should not understand. It is as if the intrusive thoughts Kaedues deals with every day are piloting him. Somewhere, deep inside, he just wants it to go away. The waves of guilt erase these thoughts. Suddenly, Kaedues has time to think about it.`*

*`He was going to take Grace to his favorite spot, and he didn't even know why. He didn't know why he liked it, much less why he was going to take her there. And the questions she was asking... They aren't difficult to answer. Kaedues wants to work because it keeps him from observing all of this. He helps Grace because of his belief in gender equality, but also because of the brilliance he sees in her.`*

***`("I committed to the MK-25 because I saw it in you...... You are exceptional, Grace.")`***
***`("Do you, do you`__`really`__` understand?" You--")`***

*`Danny's voice cuts through it. He looks up  at him, not understanding what he said. When Kaedues goes to speak, his body convulses as if he were about to throw up. The adrenaline wore off while he was wrapped up in his own head. Even devoted and headstrong Kaedues, patient and tolerant Kaedues, can't think clearly like this. The pain has blurred the line from left and right, from right and wrong, from beginning and end. He takes a moment to breathe and come back to reality; When he does, he speaks up.`*

*`. . .`*


[6/3/2023 10:22 PM] Kaedues Staub
*`"She was..." The guilt flares up, as if responding to Kaedues dodging Her name. "Grace... She was taken somewhere." Kaedues coughs, and with the cough comes a groan. "She was.. in the car. With me. I can't drive..." Kaedues rises to one knee.`*
*`His body feels heavier than anything he's ever lifted. "I can't move.."`*
*`Kaedues rises to a crouching position.`*
*`The rude wind whips at Kaedues' open wounds, uncaring of the situation he is in.`*
*`Kaedues stands up.`*
*`Through his head Kaedues feels sharp stabbing sensation that comes in clusters.`*

*`"It was my fault," He says quietly as if admitting it to himself, not Danny.`*
*`Kaedues is shaking slightly as he stands. He clearly doesn't have the strength, physical or otherwise, to make it very far in any direction without help.`*


[6/3/2023 10:43 PM] Danny Donovan
Danny was taken aback by the words that escaped his throat. He looked around, seemingly trying to assess where the accident had taken place.  **"Grace, where is she?"** He looked off to where he assumed is where the accident occured.


[6/3/2023 10:43 PM] Narration
Not too far away from where they stood was the epic center of the accident. A clean up crew was ripping apart the remains without remorse. The deceased driver of the other vehicle had already been cleaned up. The Lawmen were writing their reports and speaking with locals? No signs of Grace.


[6/3/2023 10:43 PM] Danny Donovan
Turning back towards Kaedues, he would work on assisting him. **"Come on let's get you checked out."**


[6/3/2023 10:49 PM] Kaedues Staub
*`Kaedues walks with Danny. Even though he's gravely wounded, he still tries to carry as much of his own weight as he can.`*

*`"She was flown off. I.." Kaedues' voice falters. "I took the brunt of it. But she wound up having it--" COUGH, SPUTTER. "--worse."`*


[6/4/2023 12:22 AM] Danny Donovan
**"Flown off... Then that mean Trauma Team got to her."**
> "...Thoroughly surprised that she had such insurance."
**"We need to get you checked out. I've seen injuries like these before. Let's get you out of here before you flatline."** Danny was adamant on moving Kaedues to his vehicle. His intentions were to drive him to the hospital without question.


[6/4/2023 12:27 AM] Kaedues Staub
*`Kaedues takes a labored breath in before speaking out. He sounds insistent and worried, characteristics also mostly foreign to Danny and himself.`*

*`"I'm not checking in anywhere until we find the hospital Grace is situated in." He declares grudgingly. He states his condition clearly as if he expects insistence from Danny's end.`*


[6/4/2023 12:34 AM] Danny Donovan
Frustration etched across his face, Danny firmly grabs Kaedues' *better* arm, urging him to cooperate. **"Listen, Kaedues, I understand you're worried about Grace, but your condition is serious. You can't afford to delay medical attention. We'll find her, I promise, but right now, we need to prioritize your well-being. Trust me on this."**

Danny's tone is firm yet compassionate, trying to convey the urgency of the situation and the importance of immediate medical assistance.

**"What you are trying to do will __not__ change her __outcome__. Listen, come with me to the hospital so that you find your __closure__."**


[6/4/2023 12:40 AM] Kaedues Staub
*`"..."`*

*`Kaedues' body loosens up in defeat. He chokes back a feeling he doesn't quite understand and does not make any more attempts to drag Danny along into his skewed set of priorities.`*
*`"Thank you, Danny." He had some harsher words to say, but he reminds himself that through all of this Danny is doing him a favor. He should treat him with much respect.`*


[6/4/2023 1:36 AM] Danny Donovan
**"Yeah..Yeah no problem."** He would open the door for Kaedues.


[6/4/2023 1:37 AM] Kaedues Staub
*`Stepping in, Kaedues sits down and waits. His head hangs low, and his thoughts run wild.`*
