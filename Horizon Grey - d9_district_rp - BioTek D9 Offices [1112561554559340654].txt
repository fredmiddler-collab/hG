[5/28/2023 10:18 PM] Narration
The AV flown over the vast area of Fairview, reaching the BioTek offices. The landing pad was around the other side. This allowed the team to see a great view.


[5/28/2023 10:18 PM] James Carter
He was glued to the window, hogging most of it as he oo'd and awed at the sights. Clearly not a native to Fairview.


[5/28/2023 10:19 PM] Grace Dawson
Grace remained stationary in her seat. Partially hugging the case to the gun as a coping mechanism.


[5/28/2023 10:19 PM] Danny Donovan
Danny on the other hand was knocked __out.__


[5/28/2023 10:25 PM] Kaedues Staub
*Kaedues has not budged an inch the entire ride there. He was like a statue, unmoving and unfeeling. Kaedues specifically ignores the magnificent view to focus on the goal at hand.*
*Directive: March up to Corporate and show them that the MK-25 Leopard is the best variant of the MK Leopard there is. Do not back down. This gun is a strong contender. In fact, Kaedues closes his eyes....*

*Any audible dialogue to be heard is drowned out in Kaedues' own thoughts. He begins to remind himself the qualities the gun has. Do not allow doubt to overcome the facts, Kaedues. If you falter here, even for a minute-- a SECOND-- They will see through you. The only way to impress corporate is to know what you are talking about, Kaedues.*

*The MK-25 Leopard is lightweight, easily portable, efficient and reliable.... He repeats these words to himself over, and over, and over....*


[5/28/2023 10:35 PM] Narration
The AV would begin its descent onto the pad when finally it came.
The vehicle landed with gracefulness as the hydraulic pistons cushioned the landing. The side door opened and the step unfolded out.


[5/28/2023 10:38 PM] Danny Donovan
**"Uhuh?"** The sound of the doors opening pulled him out of his slumber. Rubbing his eyes as he sat up to stretch his limbs.


[5/28/2023 10:38 PM] James Carter
**"This is fucking nuts!"** He would hop out of the AV like a child running to catch his favorite movie across the street.


[5/28/2023 10:39 PM] Grace Dawson
Grace stood, smoothing out her dress and fixing her hair whilst holding onto the case. With a deep breath, she would move to exit the AV.


[5/28/2023 10:42 PM] Kaedues Staub
*Kaedues is still lost in thought. Thanks to the graceful landing, he didn't feel anything at all. He keeps telling himself, keeps telling himself about the upgrades this weapon has received. How efficient, effective, reliable... Yes, use these words instead. Efficient, effective, reliable. Efficient, effective, reliable.*

[5/28/2023 10:44 PM] Narration
He would feel a hand on front portion his shoulder.


[5/28/2023 10:45 PM] Kaedues Staub
*Opening his eyes, he looks at what is there. Also seeing that they have landing, he prepares to leave the AV.*


[5/28/2023 10:49 PM] Grace Dawson
A thin smile was given by Grace to him. **"It's OK."** In spite of her ineffectiveness at comforting others, she did her best to do so in this instance. Though, when he became more aware of their surroundings, she quickly retracted her arm and took a pace or two away from him.


[5/28/2023 10:52 PM] Kaedues Staub
*Kaedues nods to Grace like it is all routine. Unfortunately the kindness behind her gesture doesn't even register with the man. He steps out of the vehicle and takes a look around at where he is... Now that they are on the ground, does it look more or less the same as the air? Or is it grimey?*


[5/28/2023 10:53 PM] Kaedues Staub
**"Thank you,"** *He says passively*


[5/28/2023 11:14 PM] Narration
The air in Fairview was far different than Haven Heights. It was fresh, no more nauseating slick oil and sewage. Fairview's noise pollution was jarringly low. It was only the sounds of the AV they were leaving and the distant sounds of city life that overshadowed everything else. Wind was now at the forefront of the symphony of ambience.


[5/28/2023 11:15 PM] Kaedues Staub
**"...Does it sound boring here to you guys, too?"**


[5/28/2023 11:17 PM] James Carter
James was extremely egoistical today in addition to confrontational. **"Boring? Are you out of your mind? Take a look around you choom. This is the place to be, the life to live. I would kill anyone to live in Fairview."**


[5/28/2023 11:19 PM] James Carter
He would walk past him, hands in his pockets. **"If they ask one of us to work here at the offices just say that I would be the best candidate if you hate it here so much."**


[5/28/2023 11:19 PM] Danny Donovan
Danny would follow after James. Not because James was the leader, but more that he was going in the direction they needed to go.


[5/28/2023 11:20 PM] Kaedues Staub
**"Sure. Then I'll go back to Haven Heights and do all the jobs that matter."** *Kaedues follows after Danny...*


[5/28/2023 11:38 PM] Narration
The team would enter through what is presumed to be the back entrance. From there, two men in suits awaited them. Their cybernetics were preem, their faces chromed out and their bodies identical to one another. The other difference was their faces. One face was smiling, while the other was frowning. They looked the team up and down before motioning for them to follow.


[5/28/2023 11:39 PM] Danny Donovan
**"So let me established some ground rules. Don't speak unless spoken too. James, I am referring to you. Kiss all the ass you can kiss within reason. Second, refer to rule one."**

[5/28/2023 11:44 PM] Kaedues Staub
*Kaedues says nothing. After he hears Danny's rule(s) he understands they are not necessarily rules that corporate enforced. He is being given advice.*
*Kaedues nods to himself, and then to Danny.* **"I'm ready."**


[5/28/2023 11:50 PM] Narration
From there, the team was ushered into an elevator where they were left to ride up themselves. However, the longer the elevator ride up, the more cramped the atmosphere mentally became. Added ominous lighting to the baseboards and panels inside, the shaft lights pan downwards as the elevator moved.


[5/28/2023 11:50 PM] James Carter
James began to sweat quite a bit. All that big talk he had been doing was starting to shove itself back down his throat. The thumping of his heart now skipping out of his chest, seeing the level they were on increment higher and higher. What was this sense of dread coming to him? Was he nervous? James was realizing the dire consequences he could face if he failed. He had to find a way to succeed or face the humiliation of failure. His only hope was to use his wits and stay focused, but to what extents?


[5/28/2023 11:54 PM] Danny Donovan
Danny was cool and collected. Unnerved by what could be revealed in the proceedings. Done this way too many times to become accustomed to. What was Danny's role again? Never really delved into detail about it. The only thing worth knowing is that he makes substantially more micros than Terrence.


[5/29/2023 12:01 AM] Kaedues Staub
*Kaedues puts his hands in his pants and fucking waits. No pressure. No sinking feeling. Kaedues is __on fire__. He takes a deep breath in through his nose and out through his mouth. He doesn't sweat. He doesn't buckle, he doesn't flinch, he doesn't even __THINK__. The only things stapled to his mind are Efficient, Effective, Reliable. __Efficient, Effective, Reliable.__ **__Efficient, Effective, Reliable.__***

*It's a little intimidating if you were to watch him too long.*


[5/29/2023 12:12 AM] Narration
Dun da dun din! The elevator door opened into the room. Floors of ebony obsidian and blue neon lights were etched into the cracks and corners of the huge room. Black blinds obscured the outside world from inside. On the far side of the room, a massive fireplace with digital dancing flames formed intricate shapes. Before it though was a long table with three executives sitting in silence.


[5/29/2023 12:20 AM] Kaedues Staub
*Kaedues watches as the doorways open. He listens to the elevator chime which derails his train of thought and allows him to see what is directly in front of him. What exactly does he see?*
*Kaedues does not see black blinds or neon lights. He sees a long walkway and a backlight illuminating 3 people in front of him. A long walkway and a large room are used to make people __uncomfortable__--the exact thing Kaedues has been thinking about the entire ride here. After his brief pausing to think he steps into the room. It is a small motion but one performed __bravely__. After the first step comes the second, then the third and fourth and fifth.*

*Kaedues Staub, the gopher at Shop 1113, is walking alongside his peers towards corporate workers at BioTek. The significance of this is __not lost__ on Kaedues. He feels very proud to be  here, but does not let that feeling swallow him within such an important moment.*

[5/29/2023 12:31 AM] Narration
Kaedues and his team stood before the three executives. The ones on the left and right had their digital binder embedded in their desks. The executives had unimpressed expressions on their faces, but the one in the middle had his fingers steepled in front of him. There was no doubt that he possessed more power than any other person in the room.


[5/29/2023 12:34 AM] Dyle Bucknic
**"Esteemed junior engineers of Workshop 1113, our esteemed associate, Dan, has alluded to a development of significant interest emanating from your quarters. My colleagues and I are indeed intrigued and look forward to an __enlightening__ presentation of your efforts."** The man in the middle would say as they reached the acceptable presentation threshold.

[5/29/2023 12:42 AM] Grace Dawson
She was extremely nervous, her heart racing and her mouth dry. She had never been in a situation like this before, and she was unsure of how to handle it. She could feel her face going hot and her hands shaking, holding onto the weapon's case for dear life.


[5/29/2023 12:42 AM] James Carter
James stood upright as if he was a soldier. When faced with this level of professionalism and class, he was outmatched. James felt a wave of nervousness wash over him. He was intimidated by the other man's presence and felt inadequate in comparison. He tried to remain composed, but his body shook with fear. He felt like he was going to faint.


[5/29/2023 12:49 AM] Kaedues Staub
*Kaedues listens to everything Dyle said at a safe distance. The sound of this man's voice instills a sense of anxiety into even someone like Kaedues, who has to close his eyes and take a breath before he feels comfortable continuing on. Kaedues feels... unnerved. He feels unimportant and powerless suddenly, as if he's only there to entertain this larger, stronger character.*

*And so, he turns to his peers with a look that asks, Are we all ready? Kaedues in no way presents himself as a leader, but can and will take charge if the situation calls for it as we have seen. The look back to his peers calls for another part of Kaedues, something deeper within his work ethic trying desperately to claw its way out.*

*So, when Kaedues sees the faces of his peers he understands it's not just a him thing. Kaedues feels suffocated by his own sense of fear and begins to worry that this interaction may or may not be instrumental to whether or not he keeps his job. Slowly, surely and without knowledge of it Kaedues reaches his hand upwards and __bites down on his finger__. A chill rushes up and then back down his spine.*

*...*

*Now, He walks forward. The Caliber Man reaches out to Grace-- or more specifically, the weapon case. He says nothing, but not because he is intimidated anymore. It is for another, colder reason.*


[5/29/2023 12:51 AM] Grace Dawson
Her grip was iron until he reached for it. It was just then that she loosened her hold. Looking down, defeated in her own right.


[5/29/2023 1:04 AM] Kaedues Staub
*Dyle Bucknic? Kaedues Staub? They hadn't even introduced themselves, and may never. The Caliber Man approaches Dyle with a stone cold expression. He holds the closed case forwards towards Dyle like an offering.*

**__"On behalf of Shop 1113, we come to present to you the MK-25 Leopard. We do not have a flashy show for you and we do not have theatrics to impress you with. We don't need them."__** *The Stranger in front of Dyle maintains eye contact as he transitions the case to his other hand.* **__"The MK-25 Leopard was not made to impress. It was made for efficiency, effectiveness, and reliability."__**

*He walks forward towards Dyle. A part of Him is reluctant to move forward, but he tells himself it is the right choice. A short trip towards the exec feels like a mile long. The Caliber Man allows the gun case to land right in front of Dyle with a **thud**. Shortly thereafter a clicking noise can be heard, opening the case up to the man in front of him.* **__"Take a look for yourself."__** *Now that He's up closer to Dyle he feels a little better.* **__"The gun is cost effective and easy to produce. I worked through the production process of this specific Leopard myself."__** *He turns his back and walks away, pausing his dialogue until he is at a safe distance again. He places a hand on Grace's shoulder and squeezes hard enough to rouse her from any intrusive thoughts she could be having.*


[5/29/2023 1:12 AM] Dyle Bucknic
He would look down at the weapon with only his eyes. His head was unmoving as if the case and the weapon itself were not good enough to move his body. With very deliberate motions, he delicately put white gloves on as he lifted the MK-25 out of the case.


[5/29/2023 1:21 AM] Dyle Bucknic
He would examine the firearm. Turning it each and every other way. **"Dan, I value your perspective. Could you share your thoughts on this matter?"**


[5/29/2023 1:23 AM] Danny Donovan
he would separate himself from Kaedues, Grace, and James. Rounding the table where he would be able to sit beside Dyle. **"Certainly."**


[5/29/2023 1:35 AM] Danny Donovan
**"The formidable design may not score high on the traditional ergonomic scale, yet it over-delivers in terms of volume. Our box design allows this masterpiece to house an impressive 60 rounds of ammunition."**

**"In a unique twist, the magazine features an innovative resonating spring mechanism that communicates with the user when a reload is due. We've gone a step further, introducing a quick-release feature on the one and two points that engages a secondary hammer, expelling the magazine from its housing. A mechanism designed specifically with speed and convenience in mind for those critical reloading moments."**

**"Now, the weapon's size may have you wondering about its portability and concealment. Let me put those concerns to rest. The weapon has been crafted with a low-profile design that lends itself to both easy stowage and concealment. The magazine is no wider than the weapon platform, eliminating snagging issues and ensuring smooth handling."**

**"Unlike many others in the market that compromise on features in the name of chamber assembly, our brilliant engineering team has brilliantly managed to compress all these desirable traits into this one weapon. The result? A high-capacity firearm that doesn't just promise deadly precision but also delivers on lightweight convenience and cost efficiency."**


[5/29/2023 1:37 AM] Dyle Bucknic
**"… Intriguing."** The man would say.


[5/29/2023 1:37 AM] Narration
The other execs were writing in the digital binders.


[5/29/2023 1:40 AM] Dyle Bucknic
The executive leans back in the chair, a thoughtful expression on their face as they survey the design on the table in front of them. With a nod of approval, they finally break the silence:

**"This piece... It's certainly in a league of its own, giving a tough run to the other designs we've seen so far. It definitely leaves a mark, stands out from the crowd. So, am I right in assuming that this exceptional piece of work is the brainchild of this very team?"**


[5/29/2023 1:41 AM] Danny Donovan
Danny would look over towards the trio. Sighing softly as he contemplated what he wanted to say.


[5/29/2023 1:51 AM] Danny Donovan
He would point out James. **"He is not responsible for the project. I don't even know why he is here."**

His finger shifted over towards Grace.

**"Grace embodies the spirit of commitment and diligence that we value so highly in our company. Day in and day out, she's first through those doors, demonstrating an exceptional work ethic that is second to none. In my eyes, she's not just an asset; she's the very backbone of our weapons design division."**

**"Now, bear in mind, she's just a half-year into her apprenticeship - a mere fledgling in the grand scheme of things. Yet, she's accumulated a wealth of knowledge that is nothing short of remarkable. Comparatively speaking, she stands shoulder to shoulder with, if not surpasses, many seasoned professionals across other establishments in District 9 as a woman."**


[5/29/2023 1:53 AM] Danny Donovan
He would then gesture towards Kaedues, **"Allow me to draw your attention to one of our standout assets here at Bio-Tech, Kaedues. His profile shines brighter than most, a testament to his unwavering dedication and the high caliber of his work. Kaedues doesn't just raise the bar - he is the bar. An unparalleled beacon of assistance and collaboration within our ranks. Whether it's offering razor-sharp insight where it's needed or rolling up his sleeves to tackle the task at hand, Kaedues consistently demonstrates a depth of ability and a breadth of knowledge that sets him apart."**


[5/29/2023 1:53 AM] Danny Donovan
**"Kaedues and Grace are responsible for the project."**


[5/29/2023 1:56 AM] Dyle Bucknic
Dyle would look between the two engineers. **"If our top-tier engineer, the pride of District 9, extends such accolades to a pair of juniors, then it's incumbent upon me to take notice. Should their venture yield prosperous results upon the review of forthcoming data, there'll be ample reason for celebration. Success, after all, deserves its due rewards and recognition. We'll ensure that the champagne is on ice and ready."**


[5/29/2023 1:57 AM] Dyle Bucknic
**"Thank you for your submission, shop 1113."**


[5/29/2023 9:53 AM] James Carter
When Danny discredited James without remorse, James felt torn between leaving the building or protesting. He realized that he was partly responsible since he had assigned her many tasks that led to this point. Without his help, she would not have been able to receive all the credit. James had to swallow his pride and accept the situation for now. 

All he had to show at the moment was a sneer of covetousness, and who the hell is Danny anyways? Last he knew, Danny was nothing more than a senior Engineer at Shop 1113. He was not kissing some exec's ass.


[5/29/2023 10:11 AM] Grace Dawson
Danny graciously presented the weapon to Dyle on her behalf, who was overcome with gratefulness and joy. She couldn't help but appreciate his kind gesture and was left feeling blessed to have such a thoughtful friend. 

She was so moved that tears almost swelled from her eyes—a thin smile across her face. She would not have been pushed this far without Kaedues and Danny alike. They were instilling some newfound confidence within an already introverted individual. Perhaps soon, she could repay the favor in some way.


[5/29/2023 3:13 PM] Kaedues Staub
*....*

*Kaedues nods to Dyle.* **"We will work hard to provide more submissions like this one,"** *Kaedues responds stiffly. He is clearly still moved by Dyle's importance, and has jitters of his own. He places his arms at his sides before looking over thankfully at Danny. Not much can be seen within Kaedues at this time.*


[5/29/2023 6:35 PM] Danny Donovan
**"Having said that, I believe you can leave. There will be a return trip to Shop 1113 when you are returned to the AV. I will see you three tomorrow."**


[5/29/2023 6:37 PM] Kaedues Staub
**"Thanks for helping make this possible, Danny."** *He looks straight at Daniel Daniel Motorcycle kindly. He's very happy to have been given this opportunity.*

*With that, Kaedues walks back towards the elevator and doesn't say another word.*


[5/29/2023 6:39 PM] James Carter
James turned heel and proceeded to leave, dissatisfied with what transpired in this relatively short meeting. He expected the meeting to be more productive, but instead felt it was a waste of time. He had hoped to get more out of it, but nothing had been accomplished.

[5/29/2023 6:42 PM] Grace Dawson
Grace was the last to make her way to the elevator. Unsure what to do with her hands, she resorted to keeping them in her lap as she stepped into the elevator.


[5/29/2023 6:42 PM] Narration
The elevator doors closed and now the trio was descending to the landing pad level.


[5/29/2023 6:44 PM] Kaedues Staub
*Kaedues considers what Danny said on the way down, and takes a brief look at James while he considers his peer's words. Then, he looks back at the elevator door while the elevator slowly slides down.*


[5/29/2023 6:50 PM] James Carter
James could have been more vocal. Whatever feelings he was harboring were bottled up at present. Every once and a while, James would look toward Kaedues and Grace. Looking at two people who he did not particularly like. After what concluded up there, that emotion is most certainly more intense. He was frustrated, and he was not afraid to show it. He wanted to confront them, to tell them what he really thought of them. But he knew it would not do any good, so he said nothing. Grinding his teeth.


[5/29/2023 6:54 PM] Grace Dawson
Grace knew the tension with James. It was a sort when they first came here. But now, this is a whole different kind of tension. The elevator ride down felt like an eternity for her. So, grace thought to herself, should she begin contemplating her options.


[5/29/2023 6:57 PM] Kaedues Staub
*Kaedues sighs and accepts his belief that if they're going to keep working together he's gonna have to be the one to start the conversation.*

*He turns his body again towards James.* **"If you aren't brave enough to tell either of us what you're thinking you'll never make it in corporate."** *Kaedues gives James a steely look.* **"Start talking and you'll find a way forward. Or you can cry about it."**


[5/29/2023 7:20 PM] James Carter
**"Heh...I'm starting to understand what you mean by comparing yourself to others. No matter what I do to you, you'll keep coming back with your awful-looking face... Even Terrence, with such a low life, can manage such a sludge of a shop and not have to give a single directive. I remember a conversation from Terrence's immediate boss that I am next in line to become the supervisor. It's only a matter of time before Terrence is terminated. Fuck this ridiculous project; I wanted nothing to do with it anyways. Please take all the credit for all I care."**


[5/29/2023 7:21 PM] James Carter
**"So what that I am a bit ass hurt? Can't become a corpo if I am stuck working with you block heads."**


[5/29/2023 7:22 PM] James Carter
**"The more I think on it, the better my outcome will be."**


[5/29/2023 9:41 PM] Kaedues Staub
**"I will keep coming back."** *Kaedues reaches into his back pocket and pulls out an unlabeled piece of gum. After he takes it out of the wrapper, he throws it into the air and catches it with his teeth.* **"Look at me."** *Kaedues says through bared teeth.* **"I __will__ keep coming back. And you should, too."** *Kaedues leans his head back and lets the gum fall into his mouth. He chews it while looking at the door.*


[5/29/2023 10:02 PM] Narration
The door to the elevator would open. Presenting them with freedom from the elevator.


[5/29/2023 10:02 PM] James Carter
He remained in the elevator longer than Grace did, that's for sure. He certainly looked at Kaedues before exiting himself, **"Looking forward to it."**


[5/29/2023 10:12 PM] Kaedues Staub
*Kaedues notices James' little look. He takes a moment to think to himself, about how low he is actually willing to go. Kaedues shakes his head briefly before walking up to James. On the way to James his head hangs low, but when he gets there-- uncomfortably close-- he looks up, grabs him by the shoulder, and turns him a quarter way. His glare enters James only through his peripheral vision, and it's not a nice one.*
