```Fuck!```

*Cat just barely managed to duck beneath the digital hand's clawing grasp, rolling towards the opposite wall before turning to face her adversary.*

The digital arm would retract into the wall once it failed to take out Cat.

```css
["Yeah, I'm not gonna let myself get taken out that easy yÅ«jin."]
```

*After all, she's got a professional pride to maintain. Bringing her finger up to the side of her head, her eyes began to flicker and glow as she scanned her surrounding environment. All she'd need is a visual of the hand to start uploading Daemons into it to temporarily disable the hand...All she has to do now is find out where it'll be appearing next.*


[5/23/2023 7:50 PM] Narration
A second hand would emerge from beneath her, looking to snatch her ankle!


[5/23/2023 7:58 PM] Cat Bayes
*In the real world, a surprise attack like this would spell the end for her...however, this isn't the real world. If anything, Cat would probably say she feels more alive in this place than she does over there.*

*Gracefully leaping backwards over the grubby little claws, she tilted her head up with her fingers still on the side of her temple as her gaze caught the malignant force, hundreds of lines of code flashing before her eyes within a millisecond as she began uploading a virus to her attacker!*

[5/23/2023 8:00 PM] Narration
The limb would turn red, the epicenter of her focal point happened upon its elbow and began spreading rapidly. The entity would emerge from the floor, 9 feet in height. Hunched over as it was too tall for the ceiling. It made a last ditch effort to catch Cat. Getting down on all fours and galloping towards her as the virus spread.


[5/23/2023 8:09 PM] Cat Bayes
```css
["Lanky ass motherfucker, that's what you look like?!"]
```

*The ICE had fully revealed itself now that it was under attack, an extremely tall humanoid figure that was rushing her with __violent intent__. Once again, Cat was determined to demonstrate her synthetic athletics, rushing for the charging entity with great acceleration before she dropped to her knees and lowered her body backwards, sliding underneath the infected ICE monster whilst maintaining eye contact with it!*

[5/23/2023 8:59 PM] Narration
The ICE would not suspect the netrunner to run between its legs. Its reaction was too slow as it went to grab onto the runner's legs. All it call was nothing as the virus began dotting its entire body. **CRASH** The ICE would hit the ground and shatter in millions of bits.


[5/23/2023 9:00 PM] Narration
Behind Cat, two more showed up from behind the closed door. Their bodies side by side barely gave them room to move around.


[5/23/2023 9:07 PM] Cat Bayes
```css
["Tsk...You've gotta be fucking with me...Sorry guys, I can't afford to play with you all day."]
```

*Cat said as she turned, glaring at the two new adversaries that blocked her path...her target was literally __right. there.__..Oh well, no use complaining. Lowering her stance with her hands raised, she began to repeat the same process of uploading viruses to the artificial security guards...with their lanky bodies and the amount of space they had, their numbers would only work against them.*

```css
["Latency's a bitch, huh guys? Whoever set this environment up's gotta be a fucking rookie."]
```


[5/23/2023 9:12 PM] Narration
The two entities would begin bum rushing Cat. Their bodies swelling up as they seal off any possible attempts of slipping past as they quickly closed the distance!


[5/23/2023 9:13 PM] Narration
Of course, all while having the virus uploading to them.


[5/23/2023 9:17 PM] Cat Bayes
```css
["Hey hey hey, no friction? Bullshit, that's cheating!"]
```

*Cat backpedaled and began to float in the air as she glided back along the hall, all the while working her hardest to upload the virus faster!...Problem was, she had no idea how many of these things were actually around her...Fuck it, it's gonna take some time, but she has to disable the entire ICE network with a Protocol Breach. Outstretching her hand, her fingers began to rapidly type away at a holographic screen that appeared in front of her as she continued to flee from her chasers!*

[5/23/2023 9:19 PM] Narration
They inched closer and closer as she moved away from them. Their speed was to be commended. The virus moving faster while their bodies expand faster. It was like a cancerous ICE that continued multiplying on itself.


[5/23/2023 9:24 PM] Cat Bayes
```css
["Fuck, fuck, fuck! Work faster Cat!"]
```

*There was a state that athletes and video gamers alike would call 'Entering the Zone'...As of right now, the edges of Cat's vision were blurring into a dark vignette as her entire focus was put into coding, de-coding, and breaching the company's network to disable these persistent little shits! She had to continuously run the masking program at the same time in order for her not to be detected all the while this was going on, eating up more of her Ram and Processing Speed.*


[5/23/2023 9:25 PM] Narration
Just before it was able to touch her. Perhaps not even a hair follicle worth of distance did the Black ICE shatter. Leaving Cat swarmed with the fruits of her labor. She survived a rather short but dangerous encounter.


[5/23/2023 9:30 PM] Cat Bayes
```css
["Huff...Huff...Take that...fuckers."]
```

*While she exerted no physical exhaustion in the digital space, that close encounter with the third kind left her adrenaline spiked, even in the real world! Standing up and brushing off the non-existent dust, she mentally calmed herself down as she continued her mission! That virus should keep the Black ICE from detecting her for a while, she'll have to make sure to turn it off after she leaves though...wouldn't want a corpo to get suspicious.*

In the center of the room was a pillar with digital engravings etched into it. It stood tall in the large vacant spherical room. A bridge connecting the entrance to the platform in the center.


[5/23/2023 9:46 PM] Cat Bayes
```css
["Woah, fancy corpo shit."]
```

*Cat floated across the bridge until she reached the pillar, reaching out her hand to access the command console.*


[5/23/2023 9:57 PM] Narration
The interface would reveal itself. Hundreds of panels would appear, surrounding her. Information upon information flooding her view.


[5/23/2023 10:02 PM] Cat Bayes
```css
["Hoo-hoooo! Jackpot, literally."]
```

*Eagerly, Cat began to rapidly go through the thousands upon thousands of lines of data in front of her. She was looking for something quite specific, so filtering out some of the more irrelevant information, she began to narrow her search...but while she was scrolling through, was there anything in particular that popped up while she was looking for her target?*

```

*These were your stereotypical amateur corpos who thought they were untouchable, of course the information they had on deck wasn't worthwhile. After a while of searching...ah, there it was! Cat pressed her finger against a screen that contained her target's account as she began to code away, all the while reading up on it's information.*


[5/23/2023 10:17 PM] Narration
Appeared to be some kind of shipping company. Loft Logistics. What's interesting is the company isn't new. But rather she was tapping into a new branch site of the larger company. Perhaps hired some contractors to set up some shoddy security to cut costs. Either way, she was hitting the account.


[5/23/2023 10:32 PM] Cat Bayes
```css
["Loft Logistics?...Huh, I'll look into them in a bit."]
```

*While one of her hands continued with her current task, her other hand lifted to the side and pulled up the tab on Loft Logistics.*


[5/23/2023 10:33 PM] Narration
Loft Logistics had several locations in Fairview and many more in Haven Heights. Dotting the area. They are a shipping company. Their biggest money maker is shipping. Many of the transactions that popped up marked as confidential. Hm.


[5/23/2023 10:34 PM] Narration
These confidential transactions however ranged from thousands to easily millions.


[5/23/2023 11:06 PM] Cat Bayes
```css
["Holy shit, that many Micros...?"]
```

*But with all of them being confidential, there's no way she could possibly look into them now...She'll download this information and tell Paige and Matthias about it later, might be something they wanna look into when she upgrades her kit. Speaking of which, she'd just finished working on the virus! Even if they knew they were being stolen from, this sort of daemon wasn't very easily detected, and with their setup?...Well, they'd be looking for a long time.*

With the final countdown, reality soon became a intangible thing as she plummeted from the infinite confines of space. This time, she was not given a landing zone. Instead, she was descending on the entire network of what is believed to be Vespera. Nodes streching beyond the confines like claws into the darkness. Nico was right about narrowing down the search. She was now descending upon the net in its entirity.

*Soon, she landed on what seemed like an invisible floor, ripples cascading from her feet like water as she walks over to a bench, taking a seat as two screens appear from either side behind her...it seems like she was contacting two people, Paige and Nico, from the real world!*

Once Cat got her hands onto that address. Her world began whirling, sending her at hypersonic speeds, zipping past nodes and frameworks until the __fortress__ for the CCR's bounty hunter mainframe came into view. It's walls were high and security seemed solid... Very solid.

Information began compiling before Cat's eyes. Authorizing her credentials, a green color enveloped the wall where Cat's hands were pressed against.

```css
["...While I appreciate the hint, use Alpha or Index next time...jerk."]
```
*Well, she can't really complain now that she was in! Alright, time to begin queueing up some information...Paige Underwood.*


[5/28/2023 9:25 PM] Cat Bayes
*While she waited, she could hear some rather violent noises coming from Paige's end!*

```css
["Shit, Pags, you good?!"]
```


[5/28/2023 9:28 PM] Paige
She blurted.

[5/28/2023 9:41 PM] Narration
The firewall would shatter, beyond the bytes of code, panels of information would come fourth to Cat's finger tips. Beyond the noise, another firewall stood. Querying for Paige Underwood.... There, her profile came up. Though the information she was currently accesses was purely /Get information, nothing she could set. Fuck, she'll need to get through the second firewall.


[5/28/2023 9:44 PM] Cat Bayes
```css
["God damnit, another firewall?!"]
```
*Cat didn't have time to waste, quickly flying over she'd outstretch her hand once more and began the interface!*

["First firewall down, but we got another one here, gonna handle it!"]
```

*Time to try the code, G2X!*

*Alright, let's start going into this now...looks like her ten tries have been refreshed, sweet!*

./ error: wrong bypass code

One of Cat's programs would spit out a cryptic line: Pathway remains unbroken, yet alpha strays from the order. Traverse thrice and find your way.


[5/28/2023 10:03 PM] Cat Bayes
```css
["Alpha...It could either mean the index or..."]

*Cat hung on that "Traverse Thrice" phrasing...Hmmm...*

*Cat's eye twitched as she misread the command prompt once again! Were nerves getting the better of her?...Alpha strays from the order, traverse thrice and find you way...Alpha...If "A" wasn't supposed to be a number then...*

*1243*


[5/28/2023 10:29 PM] Narration
Same as before, the wall would illuminate green, authorization codes were spitting before her eyes when the whole /set functions were available to her. Paige's panel updated with a plethora of information. She was now able to set information!


[5/28/2023 10:29 PM] Paige
> **"Nico! I am going to need to you steer, I got trouble!"**


[5/28/2023 10:29 PM] Nico

[5/28/2023 10:30 PM] Cat Bayes
```css
["Holy fucking shit, I got it! Nico, Paige, I'm in!"]
```

*Cat immediately began to pull up Paige's information, let's see what we're working with here!*


[5/28/2023 10:33 PM] Narration
Paige's information began pouring in.
Her age, appearance, __Location__ were some of the biggest factors.
Under location, it was live-updating?? As if there was a tracker on her.


[5/28/2023 10:41 PM] Cat Bayes
```css
["The fuck? Pags, you've got a tracker on you!"]
```

*Cat immediately pulled up an interface of Paige's vehicle, and since she was jacked in, she decided to run a diagnostics check on her system as well.*

```css
["I'm gonna try to get rid of it, hold tight!"]
```

*While the diagnostics on her vehicle - as well as herself - was running, Cat started to update the information! First of all, that...holy shit, two million micro bounty? Yeah no, that was gone now! Blip!*

```css
["Mass murder, smuggling, grand theft auto, conspiracy...Jesus girl, you've been there and back huh?"]
```

*Mass murder...That part kinda hung on her a bit...It could just be the CCR over inflating things, but it was still a thinker...No, she can't lose focus here, she's gotta get her friend to safety first.*

*How was the diagnostics looking?*


[5/28/2023 10:51 PM] Narration
There was Nico who was connected. His trace was hot. Additionally, there was a second connection to the car. That is perhaps how they were able to track her.


[5/28/2023 10:52 PM] Narration
Additionally, Paige hung up eruptively.


[5/28/2023 10:54 PM] Cat Bayes
```css
["Paige?...PAIGE?!"]
```

*Holy fucking shit, was she okay?!...No, no stay calm! Something must've been going down...*

*Okay, they were tracking her through her literal car, but she couldn't just turn that off...Getting an idea, she turned back to the Bounty.Mainframe and began to pull up some new information...who were the bounty hunters closest to Paige?*


[5/28/2023 10:57 PM] Narration
Scanning... Scanning... Geo-Locating... hunter182906.....hunter102718...hunter0093729


[5/28/2023 10:59 PM] Cat Bayes
*hunter182906, that must be the one who's attacking her right now.*

*Typing away, she began to search for that ID in the hunter database.*


[5/28/2023 11:00 PM] Cat Bayes
```css
["Nico, you still connected to the car?"]
```


[5/28/2023 11:02 PM] Nico
> **"Yeah, this one is real touchy."**


[5/28/2023 11:02 PM] Narration
The CCR database on hunter182906 began to populate.
Showing his mugshot (with the mask and attire), his district, his completed amount of contracted kills, and his hunter credentials.


[5/28/2023 11:06 PM] Cat Bayes
```css
["Mask...he's got cybernetics."]
```
*She started looking for information on that.*

```css
["They're tracking Pags through the car itself, which means we're gonna need to get rid of it soon...but for right now, I'm gonna need you to keep telling me exactly where it is, and keep that line open. I'm gonna try to interface with it in a bit and fight off her attacker via the Bounty.Mainframe."]
```


[5/28/2023 11:43 PM] Nico
> **"You two are really pushing me to my limits. This is nostalgic. You got it. I will update coordinates whenever I can but you're going to have to move quick."**


[5/28/2023 11:54 PM] Cat Bayes
```css
["What can I say, that's how I roll!"]
```
*Cat looked back down at the interface, has she found the information on Ghostgaze's cybernetics if it was available to her?*


[5/28/2023 11:55 PM] Narration
The cybernetics were a mystery!


[5/28/2023 11:58 PM] Cat Bayes
*Of course they were...oh well, she'll have to work with what she's got. Finally pushing out the update on Paige's profile to the bounty.mainframe, Cat looked over to the call with Nico.*

```css
["Alright, I'm ready to go, push me through!"]
```


[5/29/2023 12:03 AM] Narration
And darkness ensued for Cat. She was connecting to the street cameras nearest.
