[12/15/2024 8:21 PM] Narration
Kaedues reached his destination in due time and shortly after made his way through a small man-door that ran adjacent to many warehouses embedded within District 9. The lowest level of Wall Segment 319 was where he was. The segment represents a wall section. Each numbered segment houses many functions. For Kaedues' this detail was not of concern. The priority of his task was to locate Hanson as soon as possible, and anything else was pointless.

Kaedues walked for a mile, moving down the wall until he came across a sign that had an administration office etched on the holographic sign. It was just beyond another man-door and to the right. Inside the administration office, the atmosphere was tense and sterile, with the constant hum of machinery in the background. The walls were lined with digital screens displaying streams of data, and the air was filled with the faint scent of antiseptic. Clerks moved swiftly between workstations, their faces focused and serious as they processed information with precision and speed. He garnered a few looks from some of these clerks and a handful of soldiers monitoring the hallways, but continued on without harassment. 

He found a door with a nameplate. Hanson Greaves. This was the office of the contact he was referred to. The door was a large viewing window, mostly opaque so that fine details could not be seen. However he could tell someone was inside.


[12/15/2024 8:36 PM] Kaedues Staub
*Kaedues walks the mile like it's only a few yards. The sterile smell of the office is one that contrasts with his most recent job, with the floors cluttered and the air stale in smell. He passes by a water cooler on his way to the plated door, and for some reason it makes his stomach churn. The water smells like... nothing. It smells 'cold'..*

*Then he moves forward. The odd looks he receives from the clerks and soldiers are not returned to them. After reading the nameplate attached to the door, Kaedues knocks on it.*


[12/15/2024 8:54 PM] Narration
**"Come in."** Answered a smooth voice. The general makeup of the figure beyond the glass hardly moving at all from the sudden intrusion.


[12/15/2024 8:55 PM] Kaedues Staub
*The door is opened and the room inside stepped into. Kaedues glances briefly at the area around him, but nothing too long. He looks to identify whoever spoke.*


[12/15/2024 9:04 PM] Narration
Kaedues is greeted with a meticulously clean office and desk. There was a standing plant in the back left corner. A chair to Kaedues' right and a large desk that dominated the room in terms of volume. Before him appeared to be a charismatic man. His hair looked ruffled and had a mint green eye color that were cool. He was seated before the desk looking at a holographic monitor that was projected in front of him. Once Kaedues entered the room, his eyes flicked up towards him to regard him before settling back on to it.


[12/15/2024 9:04 PM] Hanson Greaves
**"I'll call you back Baxter."** He stated, certainly to whoever was projected on the screen. With a swipe of his hand, the call ended and he leaned back into his chair, swiveling it so that he could give Kaedues' his full undivided attention. **"You must be the driver for that shipment of radioactive composite."** He stated, a relaxed smile etched his features.


[12/15/2024 9:11 PM] Kaedues Staub
**"..Sure,"** *Kaedues says amicably after a moment of mulling it over.*
*(When Gavyn said he was stockpiling goods, I assumed it was technology. Or prescription drugs.)*

*With that, Kaedues... stands there, unspeaking and unwavering. He __does not__ opt to seat himself in front of Hanson. Standing is more comfortable, especially after the hour-long subhighway drive.*


[12/15/2024 9:18 PM] Hanson Greaves
**"Excellent, because a minute later I would have had to find a replacement driver."** Hanson exclaimed, bouncing the back of the chair lightly as he continued to observe Kaedues. **"It's simple, really. I need you to transport barrels of radioactive material from the nearby plant to the disposal site."** He'll wave his hand again, sending the coordinates of the plant and the disposal site to Kaedues' deck.


[12/15/2024 9:19 PM] Hanson Greaves
**"If you can get this done in a timely manner then it would be all the better."**


[12/15/2024 9:37 PM] Kaedues Staub
**"I do everything in a timely manner."** *Kaedues tilts his head, breathes in, and closes his eyes, as if totally agitated..*
*He lifts his hand and rubs his knuckle against his nose. Maybe he was just itchy. The air's dry in here.*

*Now looking without expression at Hanson again.* **"Since you are disposing of the stuff, I assume there are no precautions to take what with protecting the cargo? Other than it not falling onto the highway."**


[12/15/2024 9:49 PM] Hanson Greaves
**"All there is, is to drive the contents from point a to b. You will pick up the truck from the plant and you will drop off the truck at the site and someone will take over from there as always."**


[12/15/2024 9:50 PM] Hanson Greaves
**"All these questions... Is there a new policy in place I am not aware of?"** Hanson inquired, his brow furrowing slightly.

[12/15/2024 9:52 PM] Kaedues Staub
**"Just asking what I need to know,"** *He says without missing a beat.* **"One more thing. Will I be paid on commission or hourly?"**


[12/15/2024 9:53 PM] Hanson Greaves
He blinked a few times. Was this guy fucking with him? **"Commission..?"**

[12/15/2024 9:56 PM] Kaedues Staub
**"Will you pay me an agreed-upon amount of money for every hour I am transporting this radioactive material, or will you pay me an agreed-upon amount for each truck I transport?"** *Kaedues outlines it nice and clear. Basically, employers do something to their employees called paying them. You don't learn this in the Haven Heights education system unless you opt in for economics.*


[12/15/2024 9:59 PM] Hanson Greaves
He looked like something clicked in his head. Like a light bulb illuminated. **"An agreed-upon amount per truck. 1,000 micros per successful truck delivery is the rate for our newer temps with opportunities to earn more."**


[12/15/2024 10:09 PM] Kaedues Staub
*When Kaedues hears amount of micros he'd get per truck, he looks off to the side. A puff of air sputters out of his lungs and a smile is drawn over his face.*

**"I know you're screwing me,"** *Kaedues half-comments. He breathes in slowly and finishes his statement with..* **"but I'll do it."** *Kaedues lifts his left arm forward as if to make a hand gesture, except.. well, you know. Maybe the stub is more impactful!*


[12/15/2024 10:10 PM] Kaedues Staub
**"If that's it, I can start right now."**

[12/15/2024 10:14 PM] Hanson Greaves
**"I Needed you on the road ten minutes ago in that case!"** He said with a chuckle. **"I got a call to make. See to it champ."** With that, Hanson swiveled his chair so he could go back to his screen.


[12/15/2024 10:20 PM] Kaedues Staub
*If Kaedues was a sensitive man, Champ would have began the crash out to end his life as an independent handyman. No, Kaedues just walks out of Hanson's office and makes way for the plant where he'd find the barrels of waste and the trucks to move them.*

*Ordinary people would drive, but Kaedues would walk even farther distances than this. A few blocks is nothing to the guy. He makes way, and after his exit from the building he was just in he shuffles his right foot around. Something was resting uncomfortably.*


[12/15/2024 10:39 PM] Narration
As Kaedues exited the building, a man took his place in approaching Hanson's office. He'd open the door hasitly. **"Hey, sorry I'm late, Mr. Greaves... I am here to drive those trucks you needed moved around."**


[12/15/2024 10:39 PM] Hanson Greaves
Paused and slowly looked at the new guy. **"...What?"** So, that guy here a moment ago wasn't the driver?

[12/15/2024 10:39 PM] Narration
It was not long before Kaedues arrived at the large plant. Using Hanson's location details, he arrived to the truck yard and ultimately the truck he was assigned to drive... It certainly was LEAGUES more modern and advanced than what he is used to driving. It was park right up against the loading dock. Hanson never gave him any key and there was not a soul in sight he could ask. Hmm.


[12/15/2024 10:44 PM] Kaedues Staub
*Kaedues' intuition tells him just to walk up to the truck. With his credentials, maybe a high-end piece of tech like this would just open up to him?*


[12/15/2024 10:46 PM] Narration
The moment Kaedues approached the large truck, the daytime running lights of the truck turned on. It's engine spurring and breathing life as it idled. The driver door gave an audible buzz, notifying Kaedues that it was unlocked. He'll have to climb up to the door.


[12/15/2024 11:06 PM] Kaedues Staub
*Climb?*

*Kaedues gets a running start towards the truck's tire. With a short hop to prime himself, he lands in a crouching position and quickly explodes upwards in a leap that covered the height of the tire's front wheel. He grabs hold of the door's handle to pull himself the remainder of the distance.*

*(Seems easy enough to do.)*

*Kaedues now hops down from the truck, absorbing the impact of the drop off the wheel's helm by bending his legs. He walks towards the back end of the truck and looks for any personnel who may be responsible for loading the barrels into the truck.*

*(I assumed I was going to do this in Gavyn's van. I get the feeling those barrels would make the thing's wheels pop.)*


[12/15/2024 11:12 PM] Narration
The loading bay door was open with a singular worker of the plant interacting with a datapad in his hand at the ledge. He was seemingly unaware of Kaedues' presence.


[12/15/2024 11:16 PM] Kaedues Staub
*Kaedues walks closer to the nameless worker operating the datapad.* **"I'm here for the material disposal job. Is the truck already loaded?"** *He asks. Maybe this guy doesn't know. If he doesn't, the question would hopefully ring a bell for the guy.*


[12/15/2024 11:17 PM] Narration
The guy glanced up from his data-pad and gave Kaedues a neutral smile. One that didn't reach his eyes. **"Yep, its ready to be taken."**


[12/15/2024 11:30 PM] Kaedues Staub
**"Thanks,"** *Kaedues says plainly and returns to the car. With another hop and a leap, he opens up the door and climbs into the driver's seat.*

*..It's so high up in here. The air is.. well, it's not sterile, but it's not stale either. When Kaedues breathes in, he smells something totally invisible from the truck.. like it just came off the manufacturing line. The seat beneath him feels like.. it feels firm. Firm! Kaedues' ass has never experienced this level of rest and comfort.*

*When he places his hands on the steering wheel, there's a certain softness that brings him to... what even is that? What is that feeling? How could anything so simple feel so good? There's an attraction to this kind of feeling he can't deny. Suddenly, the memories of his own van, his own house, the place he lives and the air he breathes seem so desolate and run-down and dark..*

*..Actually.. no, none of that's true. The errant thoughts slip away in a heartbeat as he checks his mirrors and prepares to leave the plant with Monita's truck. A tool. A means to an end. You are here for Micros.*


[12/15/2024 11:43 PM] Narration
The truck's auto parking brake system disengaged and it began to move forward smoothly. The outside world was dampened to the point where the engine could hardly be heard. It was like driving on water without a current. Smooth.


[12/15/2024 11:44 PM] Kaedues Staub
*On Kaedues' way to the disposal site he was beamed earlier, he turns the radio of the car on. He opts to listen to the news broadcast-- even though he's pessimistic about it telling him anything about the lockdown.*


[12/16/2024 12:00 AM] Narration
*"Thanks again for tuning in to 55.34 Tab News! Yesterday in District 9 was quite eventful. Last night the Neon Kyrie Wrestling Championship was cancelled due to security concerns. Officials from the NKWC stated that the original security concern has been addressed and the event will resume at the height of the new week."*

*"What else is coming up next week, the official end of the Lockdown. You heard it here folks. The CCR has confirmed that the lockdown will be lifted in a few days. You can expect higher than normal traffic volumes and delays. With the end of the lockdown, local businesses are expected to see a surge in customers, providing a much-needed boost to the economy. Furthermore, public events and gatherings can resume, bringing normalcy and joy back to daily life."*

*"There is an updated version of the Venom 3.7 cyberdeck announced by Jinxsoft which would enable twice the RAM capacity of their predecessor Venom 3.6. You can pre-order the replacement deck tomorrow and if you ship your used deck back, you'll get 1.4% off!"*

*"District 9 Citizens should know that the mandatory neural network registry will be signed into law next month. This means everyone must be registered with the CCR's NN to maintain their citizenship. This newly implemented registry is to help combat rogue individuals and allow the CCR to easily respond to crime by enabling street camera systems to dynamically report crimes before they even occur.Those who do not comply will be punished swiftly."*

[12/16/2024 12:05 AM] Kaedues Staub
*Weather.. not interested. Kaedues makes a mental note of what was said near the end and the radio station he was listening to. Mandatory registration of his neural network?...*

*He brushes it off, or at least he thinks he does. He definitely combs the radio for another news network, though.*

**[Channel 88.7 - Signal Surge FM]**

*"Good evening, Haven Heights! This is Dray Vex with your nightly feed of chaos and tunes. Let’s dive into the underbelly of today’s happenings."*

*"First up, the Tech Crawler Markets in District 9, Littleton were hit hard this morning by a mysterious power surge that fried half the stalls. Rumor has it, a rogue AI ghost slipped into the grid and decided to wreak some havoc for funsies. The CCR has denied these claims, naturally, and pinned it on "unlicensed hardware." A little too convenient, don’t you think?"*

*"In brighter news, street artist GlowTag just unveiled their newest piece on the East Wall of the Fairview, Cedar Square—a sprawling mural of the Neon Nebula from two decades ago. It’s already drawing crowds, but watch out, drones are scanning for unauthorized photos. Art’s free, the image isn’t."*

*"And for all you speed freaks out there, the infamous Razor Circuit is hosting an illegal night race tomorrow. Sources say the pot’s bigger than ever—enough creds to buy a small cyberdeck factory. If you're heading down, keep those signal scramblers on. The CCR’s street enforcers are already sniffing around for racers to na— Oh.. Whats that? They already shut it down? FUC—!"*

-# music starts playing, cutting off Dray Vex


[12/16/2024 12:17 AM] Kaedues Staub
*Kaedues makes a mental note of Dray Vex. The character seems like they're in over their head, but they clearly have access to some surface-level illegal activity. Not that Kaedues needs to poke his nose over there.*

*As he approaches the disposal site, Kaedues searches for /another/ radio station..*

**[Channel 101.1 - The Voice of District 9]**

*"Good day, citizens. This is Eira with your daily updates and reminders from the 𝗖𝗲𝗻𝘁𝗿𝗮𝗹 𝗖𝗼𝗺𝗺𝗮𝗻𝗱 𝗥𝗲𝗴𝗲𝗻𝗰𝘆..."*

*"First, let’s celebrate our collective success! The CCR’s Neural Network Surveillance System, now coming out of Beta in Districts 9's Neon Kyrie, has reduced unauthorized behavior by 96%. Yes, you heard that right, 96%! Thanks to your cooperation and the vigilance of our systems, Neon Kyrie is safer than ever. Remember, compliance isn’t just expected—it’s rewarded."*

*"In other news, the CCR is proud to announce the rollout of the "Unity Upgrade Program." Starting next week, all citizens are eligible for subsidized neural interface enhancements. This groundbreaking initiative from BioTech will improve work efficiency, reduce health risks, and strengthen our shared bond through seamless connectivity. If you haven’t yet, visit your local CCR hub to schedule your mandatory installation. Together, we’ll create a city of unlimited potential."*

*"On another note, beware of dangerous misinformation circulating in back-alley broadcasts. These rogue transmissions seek to divide us and disrupt our progress. Rest assured, the CCR is actively tracing and dismantling these harmful signals, such as the bogus resurgence of Horizon Grey. Always trust official sources like The Voice of District 9 for the truth. Remember: Unity is strength. Dissent is chaos"*

*"Stay vigilant, stay loyal, and stay proud to be part of Monita’s unstoppable march toward perfection. Up next, the anthem of progress: “One Future, One City.” Sing it loud, Vespera!"*

-# Some annoying anthem begins to play twice the volume of the broadcast.


[12/16/2024 12:25 AM] Kaedues Staub
*That's enough people talking for one car ride. He turns the radio off and commits to the rest of the drive in __complete silence__.*


[12/17/2024 6:15 PM] Narration
The remainder of the drive was uneventful for Kaedues. Surprisingly, it was fairly easy to navigate through the streets of Monita. Road laws were obeyed and speeds were well-regulated among everyone. It has to do in part with the heavy military presence that likely suppresses any dissidence and misbehavior long before they become a problem. 

The dumping grounds were just up ahead, defending the perimeter of the dump stood 12-foot concrete walls. Mounds of trash could be seen peering over the high walls and standing in the epicenter of vast dumping grounds was a large furnace. Large toxic fumes bellowing from the large single stack jutting out from the top of the factory, housing it. Kaedues approached the front entrance to the facility. Here, two heavily armed soldiers stood on either side of the opening. In the center of the road was a security post with windows on each face of the building, allowing the employee who was station there 360 degree visibility. Lucky for Kaedues, the truck ahead of him was already pulling into the dump, given Kaedues the go-ahead to pull on up to the post.


[12/17/2024 7:01 PM] Kaedues Staub
*Kaedues pulls forward. He feels a certain sense of scrutiny in his line of thought regarding the position he is in. Something about the height of the car or the shape? It feels as though it's above his pay grade. That's it, right? Well, it also happens to be true.*

*Now the red-haired gofer waits for instruction from the employees manning the post.*


[12/17/2024 7:07 PM] Kaedues Staub
*While he listens, and maybe even talks, there's... almost like a translucent itching in the back of his head. A feeling he has not learned words to describe, something that feels incomplete, something that feels longing. It feels like Deja Vu, except slower... somber.*

[12/21/2024 8:39 PM] Narration
The employee that returned to the booth in the center moments before returned with a datapad in hand. His gat as poised and proper. His back was straight and he held the data pad with both hands with the brim of the device inline with his sternum. The staffer wore that dull grey uniform. A dress coat with collared shirt. The same colored pants that could pass off as slacks was adorned on his lower body.

His steps were measured as he approached the driver side of the cabin. Once he was directly aligned with the door, he turned on his heel and glanced up at Kaedues' waiting for the red-haired driver to roll down the window so they may engage in dialogue.


[12/21/2024 8:46 PM] Kaedues Staub
*Kaedues rolls down the window and looks at the staffer. He doesn't say anything, since they're initiating and all.*


[12/21/2024 9:19 PM] Narration
**"Hazardous material transport vehicle number..."** The man broke character for a moment. His eyes dropping down to the data pad to verify the information he was about to speak. It was only for a second until he looked back towards Kaedues to complete what he was wanting to say. **"— 0041. On time for a change."** He commented, now swiping right on his data pad. The screen was bright enough to illuminate his face. The turquoise blue hue dancing with splotches of greens, yellows, and reds moved about as information was being displayed. **"You are designated to drive this vehicle to hazard zone G. Back into the assigned G3 lot and park the vehicle. Exit the vehicle and proceed to leave the yard through the man tunnel."** He instructed. The staffer took a few steps back to allow Kaedues space to travel.


[12/21/2024 9:40 PM] Kaedues Staub
**"Understood. Thanks."** *Kaedues says plainly, and begins to back the truck out of the yard as he was instructed.*
*The act of pulling out and driving off feels.. deaf? There's something missing here, but it isn't his payment. Kaedues proceeds onward, steering the truck toward the disposal site...*

*He reaches into his pocket to fish out another stick of caffeinated gum.. but when his fingers find the opening in the package he realizes there are none left.*
*(Fuck.)*


[12/21/2024 9:42 PM] Kaedues Staub
*The drive to the disposal site is relatively boring. Kaedues doesn't mind.*


[12/21/2024 10:37 PM] Narration
Kaedues arrived at the disposal site, several other trucks were parked around the G3 lot. Acting as a visual indicator of where the truck should be relative. Outside of the truck in lot G2 were two staffers of the facility. Talking amongst themselves as Kaedues pulled up towards G3. One of them looked over to Kaedues' truck and after a moment of thought, returned to their conversation. 

With the truck parked, Kaedues could see a man tunnel just a few dozen meters away. It too was protected by these military personnel. Everyone was on edge, everyone needed to be on their best behavior. Something that was a stark difference from what he would see in Haven Heights and even more uptight than Fairview was during his stay. Large silos of hazardous materials were surrounding the lot with many of them being maintenance or manipulated by licensed workers. Unlight the rest of the waste facility, this section was relatively clean since they could not just have these materials out in open air. This place was one well-oiled machine, huh?


[12/21/2024 10:49 PM] Kaedues Staub
*Kaedues pulls into lot G3 and doesn't bother exiting the vehicle. Yet. He takes into consideration that those people were having a conversation. Guess the military robots really don't do everything.*

*A position like this.. Kaedues could actually resign his own free will if he was consistently employed to perform a job like this. Just driving back and forth.. getting there on time.. a job where everything is accounted for.*
*And then, he'd never need to do anything but work. That sounds effective. That sounds beneficial.*


[12/21/2024 10:57 PM] Narration
With or without Kaedues exiting the vehicle. It would not stop the employees from doing their jobs! Crews of people with hi-visibility vests would begin approaching the group of vehicles, carrying hoses and tools in their arms. Seems like they are getting ready to start pumping the contents from the trucks into the Silos. **"Hey, buddy."** An hard-hat wearing individual would tap on the grill of the truck to get Kaedues' attention. **"You done sight seeing? Hop out so we can do our job."** The man with salt and pepper black hair would passive-aggressively state loud enough to the truck so the on-board microphones that amplify speech from the outside could relay the information.


[12/21/2024 11:03 PM] Kaedues Staub
*Kaedues registers the worker's comment. He opens the door to the truck and steps out onto the wheel roof..*
**"Right,"** *He says plainly. He could apologize, but he gets the feeling that such comments would be taken as trivial by anyone who's been doing this nonstop all day.*

*Kaedues closes the door to the truck and jumps-- he does not drop down, he jumps-- off of the truck. He lands with a thud on the ground in a crouched position.*
*He stands up as if the impact didn't feel like a trick scooter chopping his ankles off. Could be a little unnerving, actually.*
**"Am I clear to wait here, or is there a designated spot?"**

The guy looked at Kaedues as if he was pulling his chain. His eyes went down and then back up to his gaze. **"You don't wait around. Your designated spot is getting out of this facility and either A, collect your mircos from your agency and fuck off or get into another truck. You should have an entire list of tasks.** The seasoned worker was now suspicious of Kaedues. Why would he ask such a novice question? **"Either way, your work here is done."** The man dismissed Kaedues off with a wave of his __cybernetic hand__ as he moved towards the rest of his crew.

[12/21/2024 11:19 PM] Kaedues Staub
*Kaedues shrugs and walks towards the exit of the disposal site without another question. Kaedues makes note of the robotic hand.. for a moment. The significance of a detail like that slips Kaedues' mind after seeing all the androids and sophisticated technology in the area. It does remind him to look at the stub where his left hand used to be, though. Huh. That guy's pretty lucky to have one. He must have--*

*Kaedues turns around immediately and walks toward that man again. When he flags him down, he pipes up.* **"Who installed that prosthetic hand you use?"**


[12/22/2024 10:05 PM] Narration
The grizzled and seasoned worker came to a stop just before he reached his team, exasperated that this red-haired moron was causing him more problems! A deep sigh through his nostrils and the drop of his head indicated his resignation to the fact he needed to answer any burning questions of this kid so he shuts up. The man then turned around with a slight tilt of his head. He just now noticed Kaedues' missing hand and his hardened expression eased up just slightly. **"No one calls these prosthetics unless you're a __meat__. There is a ripperdoc here in Monita. Goes by the name of Warin, he fixes up pretty much all the workers here."** He then nudged his head into the direction of his colleagues. Each of them sported some sort of cybernetic from feet, legs, and entire arms for some of them. Workplace accidents must be frequent. **"Prices are fair, but don't go expecting miltech. He only deals in a𝘂𝘅𝗶𝗹𝗶𝗮𝗿𝘆 grade tech. Not that Gutterware bullshit in Haven Heights."**


[12/23/2024 2:14 PM] Kaedues Staub
*Kaedues makes a mental note of the man he heard of on his way out of the disposal site.*
-# *+A ripperdoc named Warin operates in Monita. This seems like a difficult person to reach if I am not on business in the area.*

*When he leaves the site, he breaks into a stretch before he commits to the hike back. He can feel his muscle fibers __croaking__ when he stresses them, like hardened clay.. or rebar..*

*He takes off into a sprint back towards the yard. It's been a few days since he ran like this.. no, a week or two? He can't remember. All he can focus on is the next step in front of him.*
*Seeking a change of pace, Kaedues turns the local radio station on instead of plugging in his playlist. The simple, groovy tunes lack a particular grunge that Kaedues needs to pay attention. The music sounds like noise to him.*

*The feeling of the Kaedues' feet striking the ground becomes its own kind of rhythm that Kaedues can sink into. After a few minutes, running becomes nothing more than a background process for Kaedues, the kind of thing he can forget he is doing entirely. If he was not so objective-driven, this would almost seem like a superpower; to activate a passenger feeling in your own body.*

*Kaedues however is not someone with this priviledge. He simply runs back to the yard. No breaks. Maybe that water cooler will look more appetizing by the time he is there..*


[12/24/2024 2:11 PM] Narration
Kaedues entered that same hallway containing that water cooler. A cluster of bubbles escaped their confines at the bottom and raced to the water surface above.

The hall hasn't changed a single bit aside from one detail that wasn't there before? A holographic television, showcasing Monita propaganda. Flashing advertisements and smearing messages underneath the extremely exaggerated visuals.
**"The CCR are recruiting lawmen to protect and maintain the peace. Statistically, District 9's safety Index is ranked 4th out of all districts. Help us achieve more by enlisting your offspring. You'll not regret it!"**

Within Hanson's office, Kaedues can see the general makeup of Hanson speaking animatedly beyond the door to his office.


[12/24/2024 4:29 PM] Kaedues Staub
*Kaedues takes a deep breath in. The air circulating throughout him eases his burdens. There's nothing like fresh air for clearing someone's fatigue after a run. He grabs one of the shitty disposable cups and fills it with the filtered water, completely free of any __troublesome__ natural vitamins or minerals.*

*It feels like nothing going down other than the chill of the cooled water. This kind of water doesn't even feel like fuel.. it just feels like.. what was the word? Kaedues finds himself __wondering__ about the question too much, so he drops it.*

*Kaedues notices Hanson's demeanor. If it concerned Kaedues, he'd probably get a call about it. He considers entering the office to check in, but he opts out of such a task since it has little to do with his commission. He tosses the already degrading cup into the nearby trash bin and exits the area surrounding Hanson's office.*

*(Right... another truck is another thousand micros. I'll return to the yard and see how many more trucks there are to deliver.)*

*Like that, Kaedues migrates over to the yard where the trucks are prepared with the hazardous material..*


[12/24/2024 7:12 PM] Narration
Kaedues continued this process of getting to the facility and transporting awaiting trucks to the landfill. As if it were a factory line, everything was the same. Show up, drive the truck to point B, go to the next truck and rinse and repeat. During Kaedues' last trip, he could have noticed that other than him, many different drivers were taking the public transit bus. Something in the future he could look at if he was eager to give his feet a well-deserved rest.

With the last truck delivered, Kaedues returned to the office, most likely to receive his payment. This time however, most lights were turned off in the workplaces. Aside from the lights illuminating the hallways. Activity was at an all-time low with only guards moving about.

 Mr. Greaves' office stood out like a beacon, the glow from multiple screens casting shadows through the semi-opaque glass door, contrasting with the silence of the surrounding offices. Kaedues could see the silhouette of Mr. Greaves, working late into the day without doubt.


[12/24/2024 7:32 PM] Kaedues Staub
*In retrospect, public transit sounds like something he should have considered already. It could even allow him to make more transports. If he hadn't ran... he could have done quite a few more.*

*Kaedues wastes no time and knocks on Hanson Greaves' door.*


[12/24/2024 7:41 PM] Hanson Greaves
**"Come in."** That same line he given Kaedues during his first visit here emerged from through the door. The main room lights crescendo to full.


[12/24/2024 7:44 PM] Kaedues Staub
*Kaedues enters Hanson's office.*
**"I deposited four trucks,"** *He says immediately after the door closed.* **"No problems."**
*Kaedues was going to comment on how impressive the tech behind the trucks was, how intuitive they are and easy to work with. But there would be no point.*

[12/24/2024 7:47 PM] Hanson Greaves
**"So I've observed..."** He remarked, doing his signature 'leaning' into his chair. Propping his feet up against the desk. One arm laid across the armrest and the other bent so his hand was eye level. He picked at the skin on his thumb with his index finger as he regarded this guy. A faint expression on his face, almost a smile. 

**"Who the hell are you?"** Hanson asked, whatever smile that was there was now gone. He seemed upset perhaps?

**"Kaedues Staub,"** *He says without missing a beat. If he didn't sound so deadass, he'd come off as matter-of-fact.*


[12/24/2024 8:04 PM] Hanson Greaves
**"Kaedues."** He echoed, with a few subtle nods. His eyes moved from the red-haired man and looked straight forward. In his own thoughts before further addressing him with a glance at his missing hand. **"Four deliveries, all within a window of __half__ a work day is impressive."** Hanson extended his hand to grab a device with a mouthpiece on it. Afterwards, he would bring it to his mouth, a small light illuminated as he took a drag out of whatever substance was housed within it and exhaled a slow and potent cloud of smoke. 

**"Who sent you?"**


[12/24/2024 8:05 PM] Kaedues Staub
**"Gavyn."**

His eyes widened and he sat up real quick. In that same motion, he began to cough up a lung. At least 15 seconds of DYING occured before he addressed this issue. **"Gavyn?! That fat fuck sent you?! You're someone from Haven Heights!"** He'd exclaim. Bewildered by this revelation.

[12/24/2024 8:13 PM] Kaedues Staub
**"Never heard of a certification for anything like that. So no. I am certified to drive big rigs like that, though."**


[12/24/2024 8:17 PM] Hanson Greaves
**"You're trying to get me killed, aren't you?!"** He'd asked, he leaned both his arms against the desk. **"You're beyond LUCKY no one checked your credentials at either location. You would have been flatlined within a heartbeat! Have you ever been in Monita before?"**


[12/24/2024 8:17 PM] Kaedues Staub
**"No."**


[12/24/2024 8:23 PM] Hanson Greaves
**"Fucking A."** He'd exasperated. **"I would report you, but that would also mean I would go down with you. So, let's pretend this never happened, m'kay? No more driving the trucks; you're done...."** Hanson wanted to say more and it pained him to say what he needed to say next. With a bit of apprehension he would take a chill pill. **"I meant it when I said your work today was great.. Don't trust you entirely, but if you're that much of a hustler then I have to give that grease ball some points for scouting you..."**


[12/24/2024 8:24 PM] Hanson Greaves
**"Got family or friends in Haven Heights?"** Such a odd question...


[12/24/2024 8:27 PM] Kaedues Staub
**"That depends-- are you one of them?"** *Kaedues answers an odd question with another odd question.*


[12/24/2024 8:28 PM] Hanson Greaves
**"Potentially."**


[12/24/2024 8:29 PM] Kaedues Staub
**"Where I come from, the work I did for you today earns me more than 'potentially'. If you want me to recommend you any talent, I'll need something."**

4000 were wired to Kaedues' account which was displayed to him just a moment later.

[12/24/2024 8:35 PM] Hanson Greaves

**"I agree. What jobs do you need done?"**


[12/24/2024 9:16 PM] Hanson Greaves
**"Delivery jobs. I have two important packages that need to go to Aerial Port 2... Once this lockdown ends, got priority air that need to reach their destinations within minutes of the release.

**"Then sure, I will deliver them. Tonight. In the meantime... I am not certain on resting anywhere. This place is nothing if not regulated. How can someone pass hours here?"**

*Kaedues holds his stub into the air, and it's not really clear that he intends to hold up one finger. He reaches into his pocket and shows the crumpled packet of gum to Hanson.* **"Also, do you guys sell this stuff anywhere around here?"**


[12/24/2024 9:24 PM] Hanson Greaves
**"What the hell is that?"** He asked, his brow furrowed.


[12/24/2024 9:27 PM] Kaedues Staub
**"Caffeinated gum. It's made by Leben. Owned by BioTek."** *He turns the package around so Hanson can read it. The other side is just as scuffed as the front and is __completely fucking illegible__. Thanks Kaedues.*


[12/24/2024 9:34 PM] Hanson Greaves
**"No fucking idea... One second."** He turned towards his desk and the holographic displays resurfaced. **"Leben's caffeinated gum..."** He was searching it up. **"There are some designated shopping sectors in Monita. One store has that brand of gum here. The rest are all in Haven Heights."**


[12/24/2024 9:39 PM] Kaedues Staub
**"I better hope they keep this same kind. The other flavors __don't work__ for me. It has always needed to be the coconut stuff."**
*Kaedues scratches his head.* **"Anyway, like I asked, what am I meant to do to pass time? I get the feeling that if I step in the wrong rhythm over here I'll be hung."**


[12/24/2024 9:49 PM] Hanson Greaves
**"Hanging is unheard of... You'd be shot until you're fine enough to be sawdered into a new circuit board."**
He would turn off his screens. **"You cannot really loiter anywhere in Monita period. You can only do that in closed spaces. Unlike Haven Heights and the other districts that are managed by the run of the mill CCR, you have a level of autonomy in public unlike popular belief. Here, we are dealing with the Vesperian Legion."**


[12/24/2024 9:51 PM] Hanson Greaves
**"To the South of here, you'll find the only residential sector of Monita. It's cramped, but clean and orderly. Could rent a room for a while."** He'd beam over his contact credentials so he could be reached. **"Let me know if you're ready for the gig ahead of time. That way I could give my people a heads-up that you're coming, alright?"**


[12/24/2024 9:52 PM] Hanson Greaves
**"You'll get the deets then."**


[12/24/2024 9:53 PM] Kaedues Staub

[12/24/2024 9:55 PM] Hanson Greaves
**"See, this is why I am fucking with you.. You have some kind of....energy. I like that. 10 PM at the earliest."**


[12/24/2024 10:00 PM] Kaedues Staub
**"I'll ring."** *Kaedues registers Hanson's contact info and raises his stub of a left wrist up as he walks out of the man's office.*

*From there, Kaedues walks out of Wall Section 319 and returns to the van Gavyn is loaning him. It only takes some begging and pleading and a particular heat rising in his chest to start the fucking thing, and after that point he makes a drive toward the shop Hanson mentioned earlier. He intends to, of course, buy the gum. Hopefully, the flavor in question is in stock..*


[12/24/2024 10:14 PM] Narration
Hanson's recommended store was nothing like Haven Heights. Pedestrians maintained their paths along pedestrian walkways. No one jaywalked to their destination. Vehicles maintained their distance from one another and gave right-of-way to the appropriate agents. Automated assistant bots walked with their owners, carrying their groceries out of the store. What was peculiar about this scene was that there were no children. In fact, if Kaedues was paying attention, there were no children visible in Monita.  

The store was like a superstore, large and tall. Sporting holographic advertisements along its length. Vesperian Legionaries were posted evenly throughout the establishment. The store was clean and organized, with aisles and sections clearly marked. Products were displayed in well-lit areas, making it easy for shoppers to find the items they needed. 

The atmosphere inside the store was unnerving for the unsuspecting. There was no music. Shoppers moved with purposeful efficiency, rarely stopping to browse or linger. Their expressions were focused, and their interactions with one another were minimal, as if they followed an unspoken code of conduct. Each person knew exactly what they needed, and they moved swiftly from one aisle to the next, adding items to their carts. Similarly to the parking lot, shoppers remained on one side of the aisles. Never crossing to fetch anything from the neighboring shelf.

*Kaedues makes note of the strict atmosphere of the shop. He's not the type to be unnerved in a low-stakes situation like this, but Kaedues __does__ like he is completely out of his element. He's reminded of Fairview... but like, worse.*

*He pays attention to the signs and moves through the store as if the aisles are roads. Actually, it was pretty easy to find the aisle that housed Leben's Caffeinated Gum. He does, unlike other people, stop to look and see if they have any of the coconut flavor in stock.*

*Kaedues appears to be lucky, because there is just one left in stock. Huh..*
*(If anywhere were to have a full stock, I'd expect it to be here. That's...)*

*It's nothing. It is nothing. Kaedues returns to the front of the store and walks around for a bit.. looking for a clerk or register.. someone to process the money. There's no one. No one at all!*
*After seeing another person just.. walk out with their groceries, Kaedues hesitates to accept that the correct course of action really is just to walk out. When he does exit the store, he notices that the micros associated with the purchase simply leave his account.*

*Anyway, Kaedues returns to Gavyn's van and begins his commute toward the residential district with the intent to rent an apartment. On his way, he rings Gavyn's number.*

**"Hey, Gav. I called to thank you for sending me over here. I wound up getting more than I bargained for."** *There's a faint, dull atmospheric hum of that shitty van in the background of Kaedues' end.*
**"As thanks for loaning the van to me, I want to get it fixed up for you. Do you know a guy for that?"**


[12/25/2024 5:24 PM] Gavyn
He was quiet for just a flash in the pan before piping up. `"Don't sweat it man. We only keep it around to say we have it for our monthly asset audits."` He went to explain. `"I don't care too enough about that fragged tin can to get the work on it done. If anything, I might just sell it at the start of next month and liquidate the funds."`

**"How much for it, then?"** *He replies quickly!*


[12/25/2024 5:40 PM] Gavyn
`"I don't know.. It's a metal fossil man... Been here longer than I have... Let's go with... 2,500 micros. It runs when it runs, you know?"`


[12/25/2024 5:48 PM] Kaedues Staub
**"I'll have to get back to you after I get the thing checked out. Wouldn't mind a replacement set of wheels."** *Kaedues pauses for a moment.* **"I can't ask you to still your offer, but I would appreciate it."**

*After a moment, Kaedues continues.* **"Anyway, that was it. I'll be in touch."** *Kaedues doesn't hang up, unlike his choices with Freddy earlier. He gets the feeling that Gavyn likes to be given room to yap back a little.*


[12/25/2024 5:53 PM] Gavyn
`"Yeah, sure thing man, talk to you later."` Gavyn would go forward and hang up the call.


[12/25/2024 6:26 PM] Kaedues Staub
*With the call up, Kaedues moves on toward Monita's residential area with plans to book a hotel or apartment for the day.*


[12/25/2024 6:42 PM] Narration
Kaedues moved further into Monita's residential area. Just as Hanson said, it was cramped living. Each house was identical, with sleek, metallic surfaces that gleamed under artificial lights lining the streets. The lawns were perfectly manicured, artificial, and drones buzzed quietly overhead, maintaining the pristine environment.

There was a minimalist business sign indicating a motel/hotel he could stay in. The sign read "Neon Stay Haven," its letters glowing softly in a futuristic font. There was no foot traffic either in or out of the building as he parked in the parking lot along the side of the building. It seemed like residents were either away at work or intentionally avoiding public spaces. The atmosphere was certainly controlled; deviation was __not tolerated__. It rained like every night. Light in nature provides some acoustic noise to the silence.

*Kaedues cruises slowly forward in the van. He looks for any kind of main office to ask for assistance with..*

*After some time driving around, he hangs his head and gives Hanson a call. Didn't think he'd be resorting to this just yet...*
*(If this turns out to work just like the grocery store from earlier, I'm going to look like a fucking gonk.)*


[12/25/2024 7:42 PM] Hanson Greaves
`"Ye-hello."` Hanson answered promptly.


[12/25/2024 8:10 PM] Kaedues Staub
**"This is Kaedues. Calling to ask about this residential area. How... do I pay for a room? Who do I ask?"** *There's an audible, exasperated sigh from the other end.* **"Don't tell me all I have to do is walk in, please."**


[12/25/2024 8:11 PM] Hanson Greaves
`"It's extremely obvious you're not from around here... Does that answer the question?"`

*A loud feeling surges past Kaedues as Hanson speaks. Something vibrant and sharp and... upsetting. He does not acknowledge it.*
**"Yes."** *Aaand he hangs up.*

*Moving forward... Kaedues drives down one of the lanes. He pulls into the nearby parking lot and turns off Gavyn's van. Hopefully it didn't just die because if it did die it would have turned off just like that and there is literally no way to know whether or not i will be able to return to work in the small handful of precious hours i have left please if there is a god do not let that fucking van be dead my livelihood may very well hinge upon this*

*Blink. Kaedues shakes his head and comes to his senses in front of a door lined with green LED strips. He walks forward, and the door decompresses and opens up.. the gofer takes a step inside. What kind of room are we working with?*


[12/25/2024 8:32 PM] Narration
The room was sterile, and the overall tone of the living space was monotone and cold. The flooring had an artificial wood design, its smokey grey texture and color would prompt anyone to wear socks. The walls were lighter shades of grey, with holographic pictures adorned the wall with the headboard of the bed. The bed was a queen size bed. The comforter and pillows from which he stood were thin. With a single nightstand next to it. A small booklet was placed where its edges were aligned with the stand itself. A soft white led lamp was nestled in the back corner of the nightstand that joined a corner of the room.

Sweeping his eyes from the right side of the room and down the middle. This presented an enclosed hallway with two doors built into the walls. One had a bathroom-themed symbol embedded in the door. The second door led to a small closest as it was ajar.

To his left, a large flatscreen television hung dormant on the wall. Beneath it was a minimal entertainment center. The room lighting was dim and cool, casting a bluish hue over the entire space. There was something almost clinical about it. Clinics.... Hospitals.


[12/25/2024 9:01 PM] Kaedues Staub
*Kaedues doesn't spend much time getting to know the atmosphere he walked into. He sits down on the bed, and.. well, it's not too different from the worn-down mattress he used to sleep on in his van.*

*The thought takes a long time to set in with Kaedues. A long, long time. Give or take 15 minutes of silence...*

*It's.. comforting. It's a good feeling... Remembering that place.*
*(I feel like calling those wheels 'my van' would be missing the mark. That isn't all it did. I quickly became accustomed to it. Using it as.. a mobile house. No.. it was a place to rest. A place I could listen to music at on my way to work.)*

*These memories are tinged with something all-encompassing.. like a smell, or a sound.. It's somehow easier for Kaedues to transport himself to that place, that time. He can almost.. actually smell the inside of the van now. The smell of gasoline baked subtly into the stale dust suspended in the air.. and that aged mattress, how it created a.. tolerable.. organic smell. Good thing he showers.*

*Kaedues remembers returning to that van after pulling James off the ground. After meeting Gavyn, and deciding to salvage his job. Driving James and Her to the BioTek offices to present the M25 Leopard design to corporate.*

*.......Her...?*

[12/25/2024 9:14 PM] Kaedues Staub
*The abstract idea of a female character enters Kaedues' mind. It seems __about right__ that she would be sitting on the __mattress__, actually. He has a hard time picturing her anywhere but there.. and the __passenger seat__. With his eyes closed, he 'looks' around the imaginary space he conjured of the old van. Looking at Her swells a dull pain into the back of his head like the kind someone might feel with a bad headcold.*

*..In fact, the more he looks at Her, the worse the pain feels. First it's dull, and then it becomes clean, and then sharp. He looks away-- opens his eyes, even-- but it __doesn't__ bring him out of the van. Something other than his mind directs his hand to move around, to feel the cheap cloth blanket underneath him. The tactile feeling of the covers and the weight associated with the fabric helps bring him out of that space. He rubs his thumb thoroughally against the cloth and retreats to the space underneath it. He covers himself.*

*He breathes in, allowing the organic feeling of his lungs filling with air to further ground himself. For a reason he has yet to consciously grasp, he looks to the other side of the bed-- the __right__ side of the bed--*
*It was only for a fleeting moment. That figure isn't there. There is no one there.. and despite that, the vaguely feminine silhouette, dark as night, is burned into his eyes.*

*He releases his index finger from the restraints of his teeth. He didn't realize it, but he was biting down on his knuckle. Each impression left by his teeth left a narrow cut. Small red beads grow from the slits in tandem with the pain that sets in.*


[12/25/2024 9:15 PM] Kaedues Staub
*He looks left and right. His back is up against the wall.. his left arm is grasping it. When did that happen?*

*...What time is it?*

Kaedues received the first pick up point. It was nearby, a residence's house.. Hmm. Drop off point was Aerial Port 2 which was in Wall Section 340.


[12/25/2024 9:45 PM] Hanson Greaves
`"I'll let my contacts know you're coming. If you run into any issues, you know how to reach me."` Hangs up.


[12/25/2024 9:51 PM] Kaedues Staub
*Kaedues breathes in and out. There __is not enough information__ for Kaedues to believe that this mission is safe, personally. However, the fact that Hanson's career could hinge on Kaedues' relative anonymity allows him to proceed without questions. __This time__.*

*Kaedues exits the room he rented and proceeds smoothly over to the parking lot where Gavyn's van is located. He gets in and tries the keys. Expected by everyone, the van hardly lets out a sputter. A few minutes later, the stars happen to align and the van coughs to life. A depreciated sigh introduces Gavyn's van to the road, and he moves to the pickup point. Something about the way everyone is in this place tells Kaedues to stay in his fucking van.*


[12/25/2024 10:18 PM] Narration
Kaedues arrived at the house, which looked just like every other on the block: tall, modernized, sleek, and crammed up next to its identical neighbors. The front door opened, and a child emerged, carrying a box. He was no older than eight, struggling to keep the box from slipping out of his arms. He resembled a miniature version of every adult during the day, dressed in the same uniform, his hair meticulously gelled even at this hour, with a complacent expression on his face. The box was metal, with neon red lights lining its sides, signaling it was some sort of lockbox.

The boy approached the vehicle and moved towards the driver's side, carefully looking both ways to avoid any passing trucks. He looked up at Kaedues with a grin, waiting for him to acknowledge the boy.


[12/25/2024 10:27 PM] Kaedues Staub
*Kaedues watches the child move up to his van. A child?*
*The idea that a child would be delivering the package never occured to Kaedues. It sets off an alarm in his head, but for reasons Kaedues is not privy to the signal is shut out of his train of thought. He nods at the child and opens the passenger side door. Giving the child enough time to move away from the slow to open door, Kaedues lowers his right hand to allow the person to hand him the box from a comfortable height.*


[12/25/2024 10:29 PM] Narration
**"This is for my uncle in Neon Kyrie. Can you tell him I said that I miss him?"** He asked as he successfully gave Kaedues the box. Stepping away from the vehicle.


[12/25/2024 10:36 PM] Kaedues Staub
*It's such an ordinary question. Kaedues knows the answer, but can't speak it. He feels... no, he thinks..? something..*

**"I'll see what I can do."** *He gives the child a half-answer. Something that doesn't mean anything here nor there. He didn't think about the question for long enough to come up with an answer backed by a reason.*
*The door closes, and Kaedues pulls away from the pickup point. Now, the drive to the drop-off point begins He has no plans to visit Neon Kyrie. For that reason, the request of the child irks Kaedues.*


[12/25/2024 10:47 PM] Narration
Kaedues reached the wall section he was supposed to be in. It was quiet considering it was the dead of night. The time was 10:46 PM; it was a good time. A single shutter door was open. His destination was within the shutter door and he'll need to go up the elevator to traverse up the wall. All the transport vehicles were in the lot, off and awaiting their jobs for the next day. The air was crisp and carried a slight chill, adding to the eeriness of the deserted area. The bright overhead lights illuminating the lot pierced through the thin fog layer that has accumulated due to the air pressure. Rain was moderate in strength.


[12/25/2024 10:56 PM] Kaedues Staub
*Kaedues turns off Gavyn's van and picks up the box that child gave him. Why.. nevermind. He carries the box through the rain and hardly seems bothered when his dry hair turns cold, slick and wet from the rain. When he enters the building, he feels a single ice-cold drop of water roll down his face slowly. In fact, it moves so slowly down that by the time he gets where he intends to go it will not have fallen.*

*With the box in hand, Kaedues moves to the elevator. He looks at the array of floor buttons and points at the bottom-most one. His hand slowly draws a line upward until he sees the floor associated with the drop-off point and he presses down. When Kaedues feels the elevator drag on his guts on the way up, he is reminded of how long it has been since he last entered an elevator.*


[12/25/2024 11:08 PM] Narration
Ding the elevator opened and he was greeted with a large hanger bay. The hangar itself is immense, its walls adorned with layers of pipes, panels, and glowing consoles. Overhead, powerful industrial lights cast stark reflections on polished floors, creating an interplay of shadow and shine. In the distance, the circular glow of an airlock dominates the backdrop, its light cutting through the darkness. A large aerial vehicle is docked in the industrial hangar. Its hull is weathered, showing signs of countless journeys through all sorts of conditions. At the front of the hanger was the rest of Monita and beyond that, the spires of Neon Kyrie could be seen deep in the distance. Such a sight to behold. 

There were a few people here, and they worked on a variety of tasks involving or not involving the large craft. There was one individual who was walking past Kaedues. Perhaps he could ask them exactly where this needed to be?

[12/25/2024 11:15 PM] Kaedues Staub

a few moments went by and a young man emerged from the cargo bay ramp of the ship. His head on the swivel as he began seaching for something. His eyes fell upon Kaedues and the container he possessed and then pointed towards Kaedues as he approached him. 17 seconds later and he reached Kaedues.


[12/25/2024 11:19 PM] Maxwell
**"You must be Hanson's new hire. The name's Maxwell."** He'd extend his hand towards Kaedues. He was polite, but unaware of Kaedues' missing hand.... How was he gonna juggle that box and shake his hand?


[12/25/2024 11:25 PM] Kaedues Staub
*Kaedues tosses the box over to his other hand. He raises his forearm and allows the box to land on his collapsed arm. With his right hand free, he shakes Maxwell's hand.* **"Are you a middleman, or is this box addressed to you?"**


[12/25/2024 11:27 PM] Maxwell
**"I suppose 'middleman' is more fitting in this situation, huh? I'm simply Aubrey's top AV tech."** He'd shake Kaedues' hand.


[12/25/2024 11:31 PM] Kaedues Staub
**"I understand."** *Kaedues returns the box to his right hand.* **"Then, where should I take this?"**


[12/25/2024 11:32 PM] Maxwell
**"Follow me."** He'd take one glance at his numb. Making a solid mental note of it and gesturing with a hook of his arm to follow his lead.


[12/25/2024 11:37 PM] Kaedues Staub
*Kaedues follows at a fixed distance. If Maxwell speeds up or slows down he might notice that Kaedues is quick to adjust his own speed. Is that considerate? Kaedues wouldn't even think about it.*


[12/25/2024 11:44 PM] Narration
Maxwell guided him up the ramp, passing pallets loaded with various devices and containers. Near the front of the ship stood a secure container.

The pilot's cockpit door was open, revealing someone reading from a data pad. From his position, all he could see was the tattoo on their hand.


[12/25/2024 11:44 PM] Maxwell
Maxwell opened the secure container using a facial recognition system. He placed his face in front of a camera, which scanned his features and unlocked the container. The lid slid open, and Maxwell extended his arms to receive the container from Kaedues.


[12/25/2024 11:45 PM] Kaedues Staub
*Kaedues lifts the container with his single hand and gives it off to Maxwell.*


[12/25/2024 11:52 PM] Maxwell
He then retrieves the container from Kaedues and secures it. **"One down, one to go."** Maxwell then blinked, sending Kaedues the location of the last pickup. It was on the North side this time, he hasn't been to the North side of Monita just yet. **"See you in a bit?"**

**"...Right."** *Kaedues just put together that this is /the/ drop-off point, then. He turns around and walks back toward the elevator.* **"See you in a bit,"** *He affirms.*

*Elevator door closes. Kaedues' finger finds the floor he started on. Elevator ride is uneventful. Eyes take a while to adjust to the darkness outside. It's a short and wet walk to the van. Van purrs to life on the first key turn. No one believed that. It took another five minutes.*

*Kaedues allows the cold, moist air to fill his lungs and evacuate them. For some reason, it comforts him. He pulls out of the parking lot and begins the drive toward the new pickup location, on the northside.*


[12/26/2024 12:09 AM] Narration
As Kaedues approached the north side of Monita, he could tell how much more militarized this section was. The roads were wide and there were Vesperian Legionaries all over the place. As Kaedues stopped at a light, a medium armored tank rolled through the light traveling from Kaedues' right to left. Then another... then another... A platoon of Vesperian Legionaries marched in rows behind the tanks. Most of them didn't even look human.

To the left was the wall that encapsulated District 9. Where they were traveling was towards what appeared to be a gate in the wall that was closed off. It was the only way in or out of the District on land. His destination was literally just after this light and in some bar? A few vehicles were parked out front and the front doors was ajar.

-# *+ Tanks and planes wait in Monita. I think they are ready to be deployed.*

*Once the light shifts again to green, Kaedues pulls forward and parks in the bar's mostly empty lot. He closes the van's door with a clunk and walks inside. This time, he tries to identify anyone who is __looking out__. Could be Baxter. Then again, the unidentified man in the plane could have been Baxter too.*

*(Aubrey could have been the man in the cockpit. On the other hand, 'Aubrey' could be the name of an agency or company I do not know yet.)*
*Kaedues remembers seeing a tattoo on the man's hand. He tries to recall it..*

The place seemed relatively calm. There weren't many people here and those that were seemed to be in their own little world. It was almost as if they were here to escape something. When Kaedues entered, there was a group of three sitting at a table. All three of them look towards the entrance. A bartender was cleaning a glass and looked up to see who it was. A couple of tables were occupied by people. One table only had one occupant, and it was a CCR official. Smoking on a cigar and looking over some documents.

Now, his contact should be here already.  Where to start?


[12/26/2024 9:20 PM] Kaedues Staub
*Kaedues surveys the room and doesn't like the limited options he has for deciphering who is and who is not the deliverer of this package. When dealing with situations like this, there is a very small window of time Kaedues has to stand at the doorway without seeming suspicious. He makes use of this grace period by casting two distinct, yet unassuming, looks at the two options.*

*He first casts a look at the CCR official.*
*(I would not expect to see one of the Regency's Suit & Shoulders here. Or anywhere. He is also __alone__, which makes more sense to me if he's going to be giving me something.)*

*He then casts a look at the group of three.*
*(On the other hand, if the package is important it may be safer to have a few people escort it to this point. These people also already looked in my direction. If __Baxter__ is among these people, their attention would make sense since Hanson tipped him off.)*


[12/26/2024 9:56 PM] Narration
The three men, clad in identical uniforms, caught Kaedues' attention. A closer look revealed them as potential residents of Monita. Their uniforms, grey and faded, seemed almost ghostly. Must be the run of the mill patrons...? Either way, they shot periodic glances at this newcomer. The CCR Official, seated at the back, remained oblivious to Kaedues' presence. He took a slow drag from his cigar, then set it aside to sip his drink. Beside him lay a neatly folded uniform. The bartender, muttering under his breath, swapped a clean glass for a used one.

*Seeing the particular way those guys are glancing at Kaedues makes him prioritize them from the get. Didn't know they were chill like that, to be honest.*
*He walks over and nods silently to the three guys. In this position, commitment is necessary. The CCR agent could very well be a thorn that these three are dealing with, then.*

[12/26/2024 10:17 PM] Kaedues Staub
*That's.. interesting. Kaedues makes a glance at each of the three people. He doesn't want to reply at all, but given the situation he'd come off like a hard-ass.* **"More or less."** *He holds his hand forward, palm facing upward as if asking for the package.*


[12/26/2024 10:20 PM] Narration
The second guy (centered between the two on his left and right) looked up towards Kaedues with an almost sadistic grin on his face.. **"Heh... Then you best find someone who can help you out then."** Doesn't seem like these are the guys.


[12/26/2024 10:27 PM] Kaedues Staub
*Kaedues rolls his eyes and shakes his head. The consequences for picking wrong range from nothing to.. well, being androided by force.*
*He wants to call Hanson, but doing so right now is moronic. Instead, he approaches the bar.* **"....heeh.."** *He mutters almost silently to himself as he looks at the menu.*

**"You guys serve anything bitter here?"** *He asks in a mellow tone, facing the bartender.*


[12/26/2024 10:31 PM] Narration
**"We serve pretty much everything in terms of alcohol. Has not been any shortage in supply since the lockdown."** The bartender responded. His gaze floating up towards him. A holographic menu illuminated the bar itself. In terms of drinks, he was not lying. **"Anything stand out to you?"**


[12/26/2024 10:38 PM] Kaedues Staub
*Kaedues sighs. Having to actually go through the list is tiresome.*
*...Wait. A beer he seems to remember fondly is on the menu.* **"Sure. I'll order a pilsner, thank you."** *Pretty standard, popular. Aromatic. Also.. ordinary.* 

*His face racks with guilt before he comes out with the next bit.* **"Just a hand glass, please. I need to drive."**


[12/26/2024 10:42 PM] Narration
**"Mmnnghm."** He gave Kaedues a half nod before taking a small glass from beneath the counter and walking towards the dispenser. This guy seemed uninterested in Kaedues as he would his wife after 30 years of marriage. Within a few moments he returned with Kaedeus' request.


[12/26/2024 10:46 PM] Kaedues Staub
*Kaedues takes the glass in hand. He waits.. well, maybe longer than he should wait, before sending the listed price of the drink over to the bartender.*
*Then, regrettably, he calls Hanson. He takes a sip of the beer.*
*(This feels illegal. I can't believe I'm drinking it out of this cup.)*
*The corners of Kaedues' mouth turn down as he thinks about that.*


[12/26/2024 10:47 PM] Hanson Greaves
`"You got it?"` He answered rather quickly.


[12/26/2024 10:49 PM] Kaedues Staub
**"Who am I working with?"** *Kaedues asks impatiently. There's a bitter stress on the consonants of those words. He doesn't like asking the question..*


[12/26/2024 10:52 PM] Narration
`Turn around.` A third voice interjected in their conversation? Kaedues' caller information at the corner of his began to distort and change from Hanson Greaves to a group call.


[12/26/2024 10:55 PM] Kaedues Staub
*An alarm signal rings out in Kaedues' head. Well...*
*Before Kaedues does any turning around, he takes another sip from the glass. As he places the glass back onto its coaster, while the scent of the beer still lingers in his nose, he turns his body a quarter turn on the bar stool. He then turns his head to get a look behind him.*


[12/26/2024 11:00 PM] Quincy
*"..."* The only thing about the CCR agent that changed was the direction of his eyes. Illuminating a bright blue hue as they bore into Kaedues. `"Grab the uniform from this table and get changed in the restroom... You look ridiculous. You three, you're going home for the evening."` He continued to speak through the call.


[12/26/2024 11:00 PM] Narration
`"Sure thing."` One of the guys would stretch and yawn. **"Well, time to home and get ready for work in the morning."** The others then began talking amongst themselves as they began leaving the bar... They were all in on it?


[12/26/2024 11:09 PM] Kaedues Staub
*Kaedues grips the glass a little tighter for a moment. Whatever provoked him to do that quickly fades away though, and he just downs the rest of the glass.*

*Without wasting another moment, he approaches the CCR agent and picks the uniform up with one hand.* **"Probes,"** *He says on the exhale. He moves over to the restroom without any further protest. If he isn't stopped, he'd be out in a remarkably short amount of time. Kaedues has the act of taking off the jumpsuit muscle-memorized.*


[12/26/2024 11:13 PM] Narration
He was not stopped. The bartender's attention was set on the three guys being obnoxious and hadn't seen Kaedues slip towards the restroom.


[12/26/2024 11:13 PM] Quincy
Once Kaedues and the three men were out of the room, his attention turned towards the bartender before returning to enjoying the last of his drink.


[12/26/2024 11:14 PM] Kaedues Staub
*Kaedues pulls up. Now he looks even more boring than he did before. He's got his old jumpsuit slung over his shoulder, like a backpack on its way to retirement.*


[12/26/2024 11:15 PM] Kaedues Staub
**"Where is it?"** *He asks the man directly.*


[12/26/2024 11:15 PM] Quincy
**"Outside."** He'd reply. His voice was much.. shriller than what was heard in his head...


[12/26/2024 11:18 PM] Kaedues Staub
*Not wanting to be the questions guy, Kaedues just.. up and leaves the bar. He looks left and right, a little impatiently, for a package of any kind. Hopefully it's the same as the kind Maxwell wanted earlier.*


[12/26/2024 11:20 PM] Narration
When Kaedues went outside, he noticed one of the three guys standing by the back of his van. The other two were nowhere to be seen...


[12/26/2024 11:20 PM] Quincy
**"Unlock your van if you have not already."** He was right behind Kaedues, now walking past him with his arms behind his back. As if he was overseeing them.


[12/26/2024 11:24 PM] Kaedues Staub
*Kaedues stops in his tracks and looks at this man. Instead of unlocking the van, he reaches into the pocket of his old jumpsuit and pulls out the keys to the thing. He shakes them around.* **"Where is it?"** *He asks instead of going through with the trouble. This guy says even less than Hanson, and Kaedues was already upset with that guy.*


[12/26/2024 11:25 PM] Quincy
**"Time is money and money is time, Kaedues Staub. __Unlock it__."** Ah, he knew his full name.


[12/26/2024 11:27 PM] Kaedues Staub
**"Maybe for you. I am paid on commission."** *Kaedues just gives a thumbs-up to the guy waiting by the van as he approaches it.*


[12/26/2024 11:33 PM] Quincy
He twitches a little, but does little to nothing. Instead, he just follows suite.


[12/26/2024 11:33 PM] Narration
The guy at the back of the van tugged at the handles. To his surprise, it was unlocked! Just then, the two men who had disappeared reappeared from behind the bar, maneuvering a long, sizable crate on an electric pallet jack. In a flash, they loaded the container and the pallet jack into the back of the van within a minute time.


[12/26/2024 11:33 PM] Quincy
**"Get out of here you idiots before I have you all standing a unwinnable trial for death row."** He'd bark at the three. Who were quick to abide.


[12/26/2024 11:38 PM] Kaedues Staub
*Kaedues feels a tingling sensation near the back of his face as he pulls the van's door open. He climbs inside and pushes the key into the ignition...*
*With a turn, the van actually hums to life! After a few sputters, the beaut purrs to life, the radio kicks on.. and then everything gives out. Kaedues.. doesn't let it get to him. He just ignores it and tries the ignition again. Actually, he winds up trying maybe four or five more times before the van __actually__ stirs to life.*


[12/26/2024 11:48 PM] Kaedues Staub
*Kaedues pulls out of the parking lot and makes way back to the drop-off point. This time, he's stopped in traffic again while a few more tanks migrate across the intersecting road. He looks off to the left for a moment. In the car one lane over is a man driving a sedan __unlike__ what Carlos picked him up in earlier. He notices now that shaved heads are something of a running theme.*

*Other than that, the drive to the drop-off point is uneventful. Kaedues parks, kills the van ( 😰 ), and gets out. Come to think of it... how's he gonna get this thing inside?*

*He closes the door to his van and locks it this time. Now, he needs to think...*

[12/26/2024 11:52 PM] Kaedues Staub
*When Kaedues opens up the back of Gavyn's van, he notices the pallet jack that came with the package. Oh, that's.. well, that's convenient. He pulls the thing slowly off of the loading bay of the van, and once the legs fill out the rest becomes a cake-walk. He wheels the package over to the elevator and punches in the now familiar floor, intending to bring the package straight to Maxwell.*


[12/27/2024 12:11 AM] Narration
Ding! The elevator announced its arrival, the sound sharp and jarring in the silence. As the doors slid open, Aerial Port 2 stretched out before him, transformed by the absence of life. The once bustling hangar was now a shadow of its earlier self, its obsidian like floors reflecting the faint glow of the elevator lights. Most of the overhead lights were extinguished, casting the vast space into a twilight of muted hues and eerie contrasts.

The ship loomed ahead. Its cargo bay door remained open, spilling cold white light onto the neatly stacked crates within, as if frozen mid-task. Just fifty minutes ago, this space was filled with the bustle of movement and voices. The air felt heavier, as though it carried the residue of a presence recently vanished...

Kaedues stepped forward, the sound was swallowed by the vastness of the hanger. His shadow grew exponentially as he moved further from the elevator. Then, the doors behind him shut with a mechanical hiss, sealing him in. Someone called the elevator down as he heard the whining of the mechanisms causing the cabin to descend.


[12/27/2024 12:15 AM] Kaedues Staub
*Once again, Kaedues does not manage to behold the significance of these changes. The vast emptiness around him, the distant echo of his own footsteps as he paces toward the ship.. the now clear picture of the floor in front of him, unobstructed by the passing of countless workers.. None of these things even occur to Kaedues. He stands in front of the ship now.*

*Before he announces himself to possibly no one, he looks inside the ship. From the ground level. Can he see anyone inside, like last time?*


[12/27/2024 12:24 AM] Narration
There was not a single soul present when Kaedues' dialed in on the inside of the ship. Was the drop-off point incorrect? Was he required to have dropped it off somewhere else? No that wouldn't have made sense. The details were vague, yet precise enough where deviation from the 'plan' could have easily been corrected. 

Just as Kaedues moved to open his mouth. Something solid, pressed against the back his right earlobe. A pressure point that would make any person squirm uncomfortably. It was cold to the skin. A gun.


[12/27/2024 12:24 AM] Slade
**"One move and I'll blow your fucking circuits across Monita, you diggin' me?"** An unfamiliar voice. It wasn't Quincy's annoying voice and surely wasn't Hanson or Maxwell...


[12/27/2024 12:30 AM] Kaedues Staub
*Kaedues breathes in slowly and exhales in one shot.*

**"Talk,"** *Kaedues snaps back after a good, long moment passed to get his bearings. He had already begun to piece together little strings of information about this guy. Little nothings.*

*(I don't suspect this is a common thug. The situation surrounding this happening now would not add up.)*
*(Either this is an organized robbery after a tip from any one of the people I do not know on the inside, or this is an act made by an enemy of Hanson. No. Probably whoever or whatever 'Aubrey' is.)*

*(This guy sounds like has a fucking undercut.)*


[12/27/2024 12:31 AM] Slade
**"Release the jack."** He ordered Kaedues.


[12/27/2024 12:32 AM] Kaedues Staub
*Kaedues does just that. He pays close attention to any sound the man makes. It's the only thing he can pay attention to, anyway. That, and the man's shadow, which no doubt is also cast across the ground.*


[12/27/2024 12:37 AM] Narration
The shadow was confident in its pose. Unwavering, unmoving...


[12/27/2024 12:37 AM] Slade
**"Max, fetch."** He'd make a clicking noise with the inside of his cheek.


[12/27/2024 12:37 AM] Maxwell
Maxwell came out of the darkness, his hands and legs were a shaking mess as he neared Kaedues and ultimately the package. Not wanting to be anywhere near Kaedues or this new guy longer than he was required. He quickly pulled on the handle and began steering the pallet towards the ship itself.


[12/27/2024 12:37 AM] Slade
**"Yes... That's it... Back up, slowly. If you shy your skull from my iron for a picosecond, you know what is gonna happen. Hands up or brains out."** He continued to instruct Kaedues.


[12/27/2024 12:41 AM] Kaedues Staub
*Kaedues continues to breathe nice and calm. He chooses to follow this instruction, too. He makes eye contact with Maxwell. Unfortunately, Kaedues' lack of expression does very little to tell Maxwell his real position in this.*


[12/27/2024 12:46 AM] Slade
Once Slade determined Kaedues had completed his tasks, he swiftly executed a tactical maneuver. He'd strike Kaedues across the side of the head to disorientate him and swept his leg and pushed him onto his stomach and knelt between his shoulder blades in one motion, forcing Kaedues' arms out like a starfish, the gun at the back of his head once more. **"Stay quiet."**


[12/27/2024 12:53 AM] Kaedues Staub
*Instead of grunting or shouting, Kaedues shakes briefly. He goes down without a yelp, but it clearly hurt a lot.*
*In this position, there is little Kaedues can do. His eyes feel like they are bolted open. A brisk, swelling sensation rolls through out his body. He feels his fingers tense up. All ten of them.*

*There is no time left. If there ever was any, he used it.*
*...And.. that's it. He stares ahead and waits. The swelling sensation stirs again at the same moment he decides to up and wait.*
*There is no time left to decipher what that means. Kaedues doesn't form a thought, not one described with words at least. It's more of a feeling. A feeling like a young child might experience in the tense moments before their vaccine needle pierces their nervous skin.*


[12/27/2024 12:58 AM] Narration
The lights to the port then turned on. The sudden increase in clarity and light would cause even the more prepared of men to wince at the quick change in ambient. The hanger hummed to life as the power generators were brought back online.


[12/27/2024 12:58 AM] Hanson Greaves
**"Slade, come on now, Kaedues did you all a favor. The least you could do is shake his hand. Not clocking him with your iron."** Hanson strolled up from towards them from the direction of the elevators. His hands deep within his coat pockets.


[12/27/2024 12:58 AM] Maxwell
He was securing the crate onto the ship at this moment of time. Not daring to look back towards the scene that was unfolding behind his back.


[12/27/2024 12:58 AM] Slade
Slade did not immediately comment. His eyes remained lock onto the back of Kaedues head.


[12/27/2024 12:58 AM] Hanson Greaves
He was now at Slade's flank, seemingly nonchalant about the situation. **"He isn't going to do anything."**


[12/27/2024 12:58 AM] Slade
**"You don't know that."**


[12/27/2024 1:00 AM] Hanson Greaves
**"How much you want to bet?"** He'd counter.


[12/27/2024 1:00 AM] Slade
**"..."** It took Slade a long while before he shifted his eyes to the right. Then back towards Kaedues. **"Quincy cleared him?"**


[12/27/2024 1:00 AM] Hanson Greaves
**"Twice."**


[12/27/2024 1:03 AM] Slade
**"What you intend to do with him? Let him just walk or something choom?"**


[12/27/2024 1:03 AM] Hanson Greaves
**"Quincy has already reverse engineered the spike. Upload it to him, modify his memories and dump him back off in Haven Heights."**


[12/27/2024 1:04 AM] Hanson Greaves
**"Problem solved."**


[12/27/2024 1:05 AM] Slade
**"You want me to have Quincy waste a spike on this guy?"** He'd ask incredulously.  **"He'd be better dead, choom."**


[12/27/2024 1:07 AM] Hanson Greaves
**"Yes and we loose our tag in the process."**


[12/27/2024 1:07 AM] Narration
They were speaking of things that were foreign to Kaedues. Tags? Spiking him?


[12/27/2024 1:07 AM] Hanson Greaves
**"Come on, think it over."**


[12/27/2024 1:10 AM] Slade
**"I have a better idea. Go fuck yourself and deal with him yourself."** He'd get off of Kaedues, still pointing his gun towards him as he backed off.


[12/27/2024 1:11 AM] Hanson Greaves
**"..."** Hanson kept his eyes on Slade as he spoke. **"You can get up, Kaedues."**


[12/27/2024 1:13 AM] Kaedues Staub
*Kaedues had already begun to get up as Hanson begun to speak. He stands up, dusts himself off.. and just looks forward. He looks at Hanson. His expression is no different than when he spoke to Hanson earlier, in his office.*

*Kaedues makes very deliberate, timed breaths. The box breathing technique. He stills himself.*


[12/27/2024 1:18 AM] Slade
Slade's eyes shifted past Hanson towards two individuals who were now making their way towards the ship.


[12/27/2024 1:18 AM] Quincy
***"He's not dead. Interesting, must be Hanson's doing."** He'd comment out loud.


[12/27/2024 1:18 AM] Aubrey
**"Just Hanson things.."** The woman would reply. She had the same tattoos on her hands as Kaedues seen earlier that evening. Though, she paid him little attention aside from a quick glance before she boarded the ship.


[12/27/2024 1:18 AM] Quincy
He ended up with Slade, Hanson, and Kaedues.


[12/27/2024 1:20 AM] Quincy
**"So, how are we going about this, gentlemen? Turn him in and use him as a scapegoat? Spike him and dump him back to his enclosure or better yet, allow me to cause his deck to implode like I did to that bartender who was just a __bit too inquisitive,__ hm?"**


[12/27/2024 1:20 AM] Narration
It was quiet between them.


[12/27/2024 1:20 AM] Quincy
**"Any takers?"**


[12/27/2024 1:21 AM] Hanson Greaves
**"Slade is leaving him to me."** He'd sigh.


[12/27/2024 1:21 AM] Hanson Greaves
**"I'd __prefer__ if you don't detonate my intern's delicate deck."**


[12/27/2024 1:23 AM] Quincy
**"Suite yourself."** With that, he'd turn on his heel and walk towards the ship.


[12/27/2024 1:24 AM] Slade
**"Since I am not in the best of moods. Ask your friend here to get on the ship."**


[12/27/2024 1:24 AM] Hanson Greaves
**"You just said I could handle this the way I saw fit."**


[12/27/2024 1:24 AM] Slade
**"Nah, I changed my mind."**


[12/27/2024 1:25 AM] Hanson Greaves
**"..."** He looked over towards Kaedues. A slight nod of his head, pleading with him to cooperate.


[12/27/2024 1:27 AM] Kaedues Staub
*Kaedues' eyes close. Tight. His lips purse in a way he hasn't himself felt in a while. This whole situation... Something...*
*Nothing. Kaedues opens his eyes and does as he was asked. Or ordered. Which ever works better. He boards the ship.*


[12/27/2024 1:27 AM] Slade
**"Obedient."** He commented as he kept his gun trained on Kaedues. Side-eyein Hanson.


[12/27/2024 1:28 AM] Hanson Greaves
He just looked at Slade before shaking his head and boarding the ship himself. Slade was the last one on.

Kaedues was escorted from the cargo bay to one of the many halls that made up the interior of the ship. Just before he was navigated out of the cargo area. He could see Aubrey speaking with Maxwell at the cockpit door. Both of which stopped talking before watching Kaedues' disappear within the belly of the ship.


[12/27/2024 1:33 AM] Maxwell
**"...You think they... are going to kill him..?"**


[12/27/2024 1:33 AM] Aubrey
**"Don't ask too many questions with Slade around. You'll get thrown in with him in a heartbeat."** She gave him a word of advise before opening the door to the cockpit.


[12/27/2024 1:34 AM] Maxwell
He slowly shifted his attention back to where they once were... It was just him in the cargo area. **"..."** His head dropped slowly. This whole situation was a nightmare he did not want to be a part of.


[12/27/2024 1:36 AM] Narration
Kaedues was escorted into one of the dorm rooms on the ship. It was scarcely furnished, but it was furnished. A bed, a table he could sit at and a single chair. There were no windows present in this room.


[12/27/2024 1:36 AM] Slade
**"In you go."** He'd jab the back of Kaedeus' grey uniform with his gun.


[12/27/2024 1:38 AM] Kaedues Staub
*Kaedues takes a step inside. He turns his head, lowered at an angle, and looks at Slade.*


[12/27/2024 1:40 AM] Slade
**"I'll have Max check in on you in the morning. Hanson, we need to talk."**


[12/27/2024 1:41 AM] Hanson Greaves
**"All we do is talk."** He'd exasperate.


[12/27/2024 1:42 AM] Kaedues Staub
*Kaedues looks forward again and steps into the room. He crouches down, opting not to use any of the furniture at the moment. He just... waits. For a time.*


[12/27/2024 1:48 AM] Kaedues Staub
*He looks forward, at nothing in particular. Something in the moment instructs him to instead focus on whatever he can. He looks, in particular, at the furniture. At the floor, or ceiling. At the doorway he came in from. He reaches for the flash drive around his neck, and rubs it between his index finger and thumb.*

*His body feels tense. His head feels tense. Everything feels tense. That swelling feeling hasn't gone away. Kaedues rolls his tongue around in his mouth, trying to think of the words to describe the feeling even to himself. The act of trying, swatting at different terms or concepts until the rhetorical dictionary runs dry, is maddening. It is deeply upsetting. There is a want, now. A desire to find whatever it is that swelling is called. Like an artist without the pigments to make the paint. He just feels the drive between his fingers.*

[12/27/2024 2:05 AM] Aubrey
Meanwhile at the spacious cockpit. Aubrey was going over the pre-flight checklist one last time before they departed. Her eyes moving back and fourth between the data pad and the instruments before her with ease. Upon the front dashboard of the ship was a few knick-knacks that she kept around throughout her tenure as a pilot.


[12/27/2024 2:05 AM] Narration
The bridge/cockpit door opened with Slade and Hanson entering.


[12/27/2024 2:05 AM] Hanson Greaves
**"You're always doing this, Slade. You tell us one thing and flip the script and do another thing. That is why __this__ plan has never left the ground in ages."**


[12/27/2024 2:05 AM] Slade
Slade came to a stop and turned towards Hanson. **"I don't __need__ you to understand, Hanson. I __need__ you to just do as I say."** With a sharp turn, he continued over towards the front of the bridge. **"We've been looking for a sign for years. YEARS and now we have it."** Slade then plopped down onto a chair, allowing the momentum to swivel it just a bit more before stopping it with his boots. **"This is our chance to freedom, and I am not going to allow you to ruin it, Hanson... I'm not."**


[12/27/2024 2:08 AM] Hanson Greaves
**"I am not ruining anything, alright?"** He'd throw out his arms. **"You are well in position to do whatever the hell you want now. I found you someone that has no ties with anyone. He did the job flawlessly and with no questions asked. All I asked is that we just let him go. You think he's going to convince anyone that you just stole a prototype electronic warhead?"**

[12/27/2024 2:10 AM] Hanson Greaves
**"Slade... Just spike him."**


[12/27/2024 2:11 AM] Slade
**"What if we need that spike, eh? They don't grow in city parks."**


[12/27/2024 2:11 AM] Aubrey
**"Unpopular opinion, you two sound like bickering children."** She'd chime in. **"Keep it down will you?"**


[12/27/2024 2:13 AM] Narration
They both glanced over towards Aubrey. Then resumed their conversation.


[12/27/2024 2:13 AM] Slade
**"Fine... Spike him. Don't ask me to save your ass when it fails and the legionaries come to murder you."**


[12/27/2024 2:13 AM] Slade
**"I'll be home free by then so what does it matter? Right?"**


[12/27/2024 2:15 AM] Hanson Greaves
**"Thank you."**


[12/27/2024 2:16 AM] Aubrey
**"Problem with that plan."** She turned her head towards them. **"We got a few days before the lockdown ends. Unless you want to be observed by Vespera, I'd suggest we wait before we drop our new friend off..."**


[12/27/2024 2:17 AM] Quincy
**"I can only do so much. Allowing Aubrey to fly unrestricted has made my superiors...questionable."**


[12/27/2024 2:18 AM] Quincy
**"__you__ cannot afford to deviate from your plan. Either kill him or keep him captive. Its the only choices."**


[12/27/2024 2:19 AM] Hanson Greaves
**"Damn it..."**


[12/27/2024 2:20 AM] Slade
**"Should've listened."**


[12/27/2024 2:20 AM] Hanson Greaves
**"No, you should've listened. Had you allowed me to just handle the situation, I would have sent him on his way. But you decided to take matters in your own hands. You're complicating things and projecting."**


[12/27/2024 2:21 AM] Slade
He glanced over towards Quincy.


[12/27/2024 2:21 AM] Quincy
**"Don't look at me. I am merely here to uphold my end of the bargin. The moment you prime that warhead, I don't exist."**


[12/27/2024 2:22 AM] Slade
**"An expensive bargin."** He'd mutter.


[12/27/2024 2:22 AM] Slade
**"Let's think."**


[12/27/2024 2:22 AM] Hanson Greaves
**"Oh, we could've used reason hours ago."**


[12/27/2024 2:25 AM] Slade
He'd ignore Hanson. **"We secured Aubrey as our pilot, we secured unrestricted airspace access and valuable data from Quincy... We used an outsider to move everything we needed to complete the warhead. All that is missing, is a window."**


[12/27/2024 2:36 AM] Hanson Greaves
Hanson's eyebrows rose for a moment, pinching his nose. **"I'm going home."**


[12/27/2024 2:38 AM] Slade
Slade eyeballed Hanson as he moved past him. When the door closed, he turned his attention back to the remaining two.


[12/27/2024 2:38 AM] Aubrey
**"Same location?"** She asked as she finally fired up the ship's engines.


[12/27/2024 2:38 AM] Slade
**"Yeah.."**


[1/1/2025 10:09 PM] Narration
Kaedues was locked within the room he was 'designated' to for the remainder of the night. No visitors came to see him, leaving the caliber man to his own devices for roughly 6-7 hours. Would have slept during his time secluded in the room? Perhaps, locked in a state of thought?


[1/1/2025 10:23 PM] Kaedues Staub
*Kaedues has trouble keeping himself still. That buzzing, uncomfortable feeling in the back of his head motivates him to do anything but stay still. He __has to__ move. If he can't move, he'll sleep. Even that seems uncomfortable, at least right now.*

*Kaedues surveys the room. He seriously doubts that the people who accompanied Hanson would be stupid enough to leave keys or important information in this room, given his situation. He does still look anyway.*
*The room... smells sterile. Like the space outside Hanson's office.*

*He looks down at himself. The grey uniform he's wearing right now doesn't sit well with him.*
*(I left it in Gavyn's van.. my jumpsuit.)*


[1/1/2025 10:31 PM] Narration
Kaedues throughout his investigation found several items.
• __Empty Storage Containers__: There were two stacks of discarded plastic and metal boxes used to store equipment of some kind.
• __Cleaning Supplies__: Which gave the room that sterile aroma. Some of which have been opened.
• __Loose Fasteners__: A handful of screws, bolts, and washers scattered across the room.
• __Utility Components:__: Spare parts such as wiring, fuses, and a pair of wall panels scattered about.
• __An forgotten smart handgun, underneath the bed__: Kaedues noticed that in one of the compartments underneath the bed housed a single smart handgun with no spare magazines. It was loaded.

[1/1/2025 10:50 PM] Kaedues Staub
*Kaedues scours the room for anything, and is... more than surprised to find a gun. He stills himself almost completely-- the swelling feeling from earlier replaced by curiosity and suspicion. He looks over to the door sealing him off from the rest of the ship. There's no window.*

*His fingers wrap around the handle. He picks it up, and gives the weapon a good look. He is familiar with kinetic weaponry, but this is a far cry from those analog mechanisms. This looks like future tech. If Kaedues had the money to commission this gun, he would find it irresponsible. It's like seeing a car that uses jet fuel cruise down the highway.*

*After some quiet thinking, Kaedues decides that he should accept this strange opportunity to completely disassemble the gun. Kaedues __does not__ check the chamber of the gun. He does, however, clear it anyway as he assumes there is a round in there.*
*The rest of the disassembly is also familiar to Kaedues. He takes the gun apart and lays its pieces in the container he found it in. Then, he puts the whole thing back together. Suddenly, the smart handgun no longer seems so alien.*


[1/1/2025 11:02 PM] Kaedues Staub
*He notes the chips and boards inside the housing of the gun. Now looking at the assembled gun, Kaedues draws a blank. Why is he bothering with this?*
*His eyes drift over to the locked door he came in from.*
*(...I'm here at the whims of that man. In a sense, I was going to reach this point ever since I accepted Hanson's deal.)*
*A thought crosses his mind.*
*(I could have just been killed. If I had to choose between being abducted and being killed, then this is definitely the __better__ outcome.)*
*Just then, he happens to look at the gun in such a way that he can see himself. His own eyes gleer back at him.*
*`But you had no choice.`*

*It takes him another moment, but Kaedues clears the magazine of the gun now. He makes sure the bullets are aligned and facing upwards-- something about their pointed tops makes him want to be cautious.*
*The magazine is re-inserted into the gun. Without another wasted moment, Kaedues attempts to dry-fire the thing.*


[1/1/2025 11:05 PM] Narration
The moment Kaedues squeezes the trigger, the hammer clicked. It's operational without biometrics. Only one would wonder just what makes this weapon a 'smart' weapon.


[1/1/2025 11:17 PM] Kaedues Staub
*Probably passed with high marks at the shooting range.*

*Sure, Kaedues has a weapon. This is where the common street thug fucks up every single time, because they do not think of step 2.*
*The logistics of using this weapon..*

*(I am indoors. Actually, I am more than indoors, I am in an aircraft. Puncturing a hole in this thing's hull could cause a change in the air pressure, or worst case, have some effect on the vehicle's flight path. ..If I remember correctly.)*
*However, something about the deafening silence that surrounds the room he is in tells Kaedues that this may not be a problem.*

*(The map of this place.. it's full of hallways. There is literally no worse place to have a gunfight than someplace like this. I'd be better off holing myself up in here.)*
*His head shakes involuntarily, and his gut wrenches.*
*(The bald one seems eager to fry just about anyone's hardware. Seeing as how the guy hijacked Hanson's phone call--a choom of his own no less-- and claims to have fried the bartender I spoke with..)*

*(If we assume I just get plain lucky.. there are seven bullets. One for the loud mouth, one for the bald one, one for Hanson. Scratch that-- two for the bald one, two for the loud mouth. That still leaves me with two for when things go south.)*


[1/1/2025 11:23 PM] Kaedues Staub
*He shakes his head.*
*(It's not that simple, though. I have no idea where I am. I know of __no__ landing sites for a vehicle this big other than the one I came from, and if I get the feeling that leaving Monita from that point would be impossible. If I bring the thing back to Haven Heights, the eight nearest squadrons of CCR Lawmen will band together and turn me into swiss cheese.)*

*Well.. fuck.*
*Kaedues decides to pick up one of the bullets and take a closer look at it. It looks like... a thumbtack. A long thumbtack, but still..*

*(These bullets are not normal. I get the feeling they aren't made for combat.. nothing this over-engineered would ever be used by anyone. It's clearly too expensive.)*


[1/1/2025 11:34 PM] Kaedues Staub
*(Bullets with spiked tips.. If you shot this at someone, it'd definitely stick..)*
*He continues to study the shape of the bullet.*
*(I know why it looks odd now. A thumbtack is designed to stick, but not to push through. Normal bullets need to make holes. Since this thing looks expensive, I guess I should assume the bullet __does something__.)*

**"..Scheiße.."** *He mutters to himself.*
*(They were talking about 'Spikes' earlier. Maybe that's what these things are? If that's true, somehow, then just firing the gun at all could...)*
**"Ugh. I don't know enough."** *The conclusions Kaedues was drawing up have no real grounds. Most of them were thought of top-down where Kaedues actually has a shot of getting out, anyway. It could be impossible.*


[1/1/2025 11:57 PM] Kaedues Staub
*Kaedues shakes his head. He decides to re-load the gun and stash it back underneath the bed where he found it. If they didn't know it was there before, they might not look for a little while.*

*Then he moves to lay flat against the bed. Knowing that there is a gun beneath him gives Kaedues some kind of relief. Enough to close his eyes and sleep, at least. It'd be another one of those nights.*


[1/2/2025 12:03 AM] Kaedues Staub឵
*`The shop's door decompresses and opens as Kaedues steps through. Since he was just tipped off that his job could be swept out from under him, he is reasonably upset and feeling confrontational.`*

[1/2/2025 12:18 AM] Kaedues Staub឵
*` The first person who could be responsible that comes to mind is his supervisor, who is always in his office.`*

*`There's a lot to be said, honestly. Kaedues could speak a volume on how betrayed he feels, or how cutting him off right now is horribly indifferent to his situation. Instead, he just cuts to the chase and knocks on the manager's door. There's no answer at first. After Kaedues knocks again, a voice resonates from behind the door.`*

***`"I'm busy. What is it?"`***

*`Kaedues wants to keep a level head, but the situation he's been placed into is odd. He can't help but speak his mind.`*
*`"..I think you know. I think you know exactly why I'm here, you prick! Open the door!"`*
*`Kaedues pounds once on the door!`*
*`"Do you even know what kind of weight I pull around here? Not once have I ever turned you down! Not! Once! Not a single fucking time!"`*

*`After a short time, one set of pale fingers curls in front of the door and slides it open. There he is, the shop's lead. The man is tall, pale, and imposing. His blonde hair is caked in dust, and his long, grey coat ensures he does not stand out anywhere. His chest rises and falls in exasperation, and he combs his fingers through his hair. The man's eyes burn a dark hole where ever they look.`*

__***`"..Who the fuck let you outside?"`***__*` He demands to know of Kaedues.`*


[1/2/2025 12:19 AM] Kaedues Staub
*Kaedues breathes in and sits up abruptly. He's sweating. The feeling would quickly subside, but for the moment, it is not lost on him.*


[1/2/2025 12:26 AM] Narration
The hull of the ship was quiet which was different from the night before. He heard the engines to the ship crescendo and idle frequently, subtle inertia pulls here and there. But now, it was still and unmoving. Had they landed at their destination? If so, how long has it been since he had been held in the room. 
-# clink... clink... clink
clink... clink... clink
**Clink... Clink... Clink!**

Someone was walking down the hall outside Kaedues' current dwelling. Approaching his room no doubt. Then when it reached its apex the steps stopped and silence hung in the air...


[1/2/2025 12:27 AM] Kaedues Staub
*Kaedues instinctually gets out of bed and stands up. He watches the door on impulse.*


[1/2/2025 12:32 AM] Narration
Kaedues stood there for a solid 10 seconds before the audiable beep of the door disengaging resonated in his ears. The frame illuminated and the door opened...


[1/2/2025 12:32 AM] Maxwell
It was Maxwell with a tray of food in his grasp. He did not know what to expect upon opening the door as his eyes scanned the surroundings immediately before focusing on Kaedues who now stood in the center of the room. Maxwell's muscles tensed upon gazing on the man before him. Surely he had no hard feeling for him, right? He only did what he was told to do. **"H-hey, um.. Kaedues."** He started off timidly, hesitating on entering the room. Once he crossed the threshold, the door closed behind him. **"I got you some food... I'll uhh... just leave it on the table for you."** Maxwell then started to side step towards the table, keeping Kaedues in his line of sight. He was wary, very wary of Kaedues.

*Kaedues swallows as he looks at Maxwell. It takes Kaedues a cold second to nod.*
**"Thank you."** *Kaedues replies. Each word is pronounced with care. He looks at Maxwell, and at the tray in his hands.*


[1/2/2025 12:49 AM] Maxwell
With the tray placed on the table, he moved back towards the door.

*He has questions, but not the voice to ask them. Kaedues looks at the tray of food in front of him.*


[1/2/2025 12:52 AM] Kaedues Staub
*(Just a matter of time now.)*


[1/2/2025 12:53 AM] Narration
The door opened and Maxwell exited the room. The sliding wall moved back into place and another tone emitted from the door. It was now locked.


[1/2/2025 12:54 AM] Narration
The food were... rations? They were in packages. Dried meat sticks and fruits. Lovely.


[1/2/2025 1:00 AM] Kaedues Staub
*Kaedues picks up the package with his right hand and rips open the top of the package with his..*

*(This.. is getting very old.)*
*He brings the package to his mouth and bites down, ripping it open with his teeth. He shoves his hand inside, taking out piece after piece of meat or fruit. The pieces are broken into manageable sizes if need be, but are wolfed down regardless. He spends almost none of the time tasting any of it, though, he prefers the fruit. It is easier to chew, and faster to eat for that reason.*

*He takes routine breaks, sometimes, to make sure he does not develop hiccups from eating too fast. All of these actions happen in order, in time, in a cycle, until the meal is finished.*


[1/3/2025 7:26 PM] Narration
It was not long after Kaedues finished his meal that a more smoother pattern of steps coming from the hallway resonated in Staub's ear. It wasn't Maxwell's quick and hurried steps...


[1/3/2025 7:26 PM] Hanson Greaves
The door opened and Hanson entered the room, his lips pressed thin throughout its width as he passed the threshold of the door. **"Kaedues... Buddy."** He had a grin that did not reach his eyes. This was more of just an introduction rather than an actual greeting. **"Holding up?"** He asked as the door behind him closed. His hands now in his pockets. A slight tilt of his head as his right eye took priority in his focus. **"Mmn?"**


[1/3/2025 7:40 PM] Kaedues Staub
*Kaedues had already been sitting up as an attent person might when Hanson entered the room. He turns his head to Hanson.*
**"What?"** *He asks. Despite the situation, he sounds neutral. Like he always does.*

He sighed. **"I was asking how you were doing. But considering that nothing much as changed since last night. I would assume you're doing just fine."** With a wave of his dismissive hand, he would move on to his reason for being there. **"Look, I didn't mean for things to go down the way they did."** His tone hardened as if he was annoyed? **"My, partner, wasn't even suppose to be there but decided otherwise."** He then removed one hand from his jacket, pointing at Kaedues **"I am certain you have questions, but I wanted to be the one to say I am working something out with our friend. You and I have unfinished business."** His hand went back into his pocket.

[1/3/2025 8:15 PM] Hanson Greaves
He looked towards the door then back towards Kaedues **"My point is.."**  It came through gritted teeth. **"I'm going to get you out of this situation.

[1/3/2025 8:27 PM] Kaedues Staub
*Kaedues takes a deep breath in, and out. He stares a hole into Hanson's skull.* **"This is the first time in a long time that I have __ever__ agreed to a job I did not know the complete specifications of. Considering the situation, I did not want to complicate what was already looking to be a risky situation for myself and for you."**

*Kaedues presses his index finger and thumb together and rubs them around.*

**"Your job wound up being a very good example of why I ask questions."** *Kaedues' eyes do not deviate even the smallest fraction of an inch away from Hanson.* **"What did I deliver?"**


[1/3/2025 8:30 PM] Hanson Greaves
**"..."** He winched, not really something he wanted to *answer* considering the company he was in. After some deliberation internally, he came up with an answer... **"Two components for a device, a weapon, although not lethal."** He added.

**"No. What are you asking me to do?"**


[1/3/2025 8:49 PM] Hanson Greaves
He'd pull out a shard and held it level with his pocket. It held it out to reveal it, but not to openly give it to him. This shard is one that you would slot into your neural socket. Similar to the one Grace had on her desk. **"This."**


[1/3/2025 8:55 PM] Kaedues Staub
**"To myself?"**


[1/3/2025 9:01 PM] Hanson Greaves
**"Correct. It's the only way I can convince Slade not to dispose of you. Insert this and next thing you know, you'll obtain all that you wanted from me. A deal is a deal."** He elaborated. Raising the shard slightly before snapping his arm back into its original position.

*Kaedues extends his hand for the shard.*

If you answer it, and I believe you are telling the truth, I will use this."** *He looks Hanson square in the eyes, like usual. The Kaedues Way™️.*

*Kaedues sighs, as if disappointed. He nods quietly.*
**"That's not what I wanted to hear."** *Short pause.* **"__but..__ I believe you."**

*He raises the chip up to his neck.* **"If you need work done, give me a call. Next time, I will ask more questions."**
*Just as he is about to insert it-- no really, like the last millimeter--*
**"Oh. Check the bed. You guys left your gun in here."** *Aaand he pushes the thing in.*


[1/3/2025 9:37 PM] Narration
The moment he slotted the shard, a pixel in his vision went **dead**. 

At first, it was nothing, just a flicker in the corner of his eye. Then, it spread.... Doubling and doubling again, the redness devouring his sight like a **virus**. Throughout this process, he had no control of his body as he collapsed to the floor. There was no pain... Not a sound. Not a whisper of the crash of his dead weight... Not even the faintest scrape of sensation. His heartbeat? What heartbeat? His breath, Nonexistent.

There was no time to panic. No room for it. Thought itself was unraveled like a runaway decompiler. He was nothing. Less than a spark. Less than the shadow of a spark. During his descent, who was steering? Was it the boy who had less than a flash to croak. The drone? __It never mattered.__

Whoever or whatever was steering led him. **Right. Into. Nothing.**

Kaedues was spiked.

The pair continued on their way through the alleyway... The sound of some life was audible, but it seemed so unobtainable—It was as if it surrounded them. Spilling out of the alleyway, Cat, and Ghost appear on a side street now in some industrial sector.

The road stretched before them, broad enough to accommodate vehicles of most sizes, from compact cars to larger trucks. However, despite its ample width, an unsettling silence enveloped the surroundings. No soul or vehicle stirred; the world felt eerily motionless as if time had stood at a standstill. The air was thick with an uncanny stillness, heightening the desolation in the atmosphere.

**”It kinda feels like a horror movie, huh…?”** *Cat muttered lowly as she examined the hauntingly empty and quiet streets, the horizon painted with an eerie gray backdrop that shrouded the city, hiding whatever lurked behind.*


[3/3/2025 7:40 PM] Ghost
*Ghost scanned his surroundings. When Cat compared this to a horror movie, he simply responded,* **"What?"** *genuinely confused by the remark.*

*Regardless, they needed to find shelter and plan their next moves. The unknown lurked in this place, and in their current state, they were vulnerable.*


[3/3/2025 7:43 PM] Cat Bayes
“Y’know, like Quiet Mountain? The second one was kinda ass, but-“** *Cat stopped herself, shaking her head as if berating herself.* **”Sorry, getting off topic…”**

*For now, she continued to scan the empty city around them in search for a place to lay low.*


[3/3/2025 7:48 PM] Narration
A hydraulic door in the fog suddenly opened! They could dip back into the alley they came from to avoid being detected!


[3/3/2025 7:50 PM] Ghost
*Without hesitation, he gestured sharply to Cat and moved swiftly, retreating back into the alley they had come from. His rifle was already raised, eyes locked on the opening through the dense fog.*


[3/3/2025 7:51 PM] Cat Bayes
*Cat was quick to follow Cole’s lead, moving closely beside him as they took cover behind the previous alley. Hopefully they weren’t seen!*


[3/3/2025 8:01 PM] Narration
A large group of people exited the building, all wearing matching uniforms. Approximately 40 of them emerged and began walking towards an alley that was perpendicular to their path. However, the likelihood of them actually heading in that direction seemed slim. Surrounding this group were members of the Vesperian Legion, who appeared heavily augmented with cybernetics, making them look almost like complete robots. From head to toe, they looked lethal. Their gear featured red LED lights as accents, illuminating the grey fog with a wash of red that bled into the surrounding area.

The people being escorted were like drones themselves. No one looked around, and there was no gripping or intricate hair color, eye color, or distinctive characteristics. They looked dead. Yet, they moved and breathed, which was their own indication of being alive.

There were roughly 6 Vesperian Legionaries...


[3/3/2025 8:05 PM] Ghost
*Beneath the mask, Cole couldn't help but calculate his odds. Could he take them on? Judging by their gear, even taking down one might be a stretch with what he had. He still had a few impact grenades, but engaging now would be reckless. Staying low was the priority. __He exhaled slowly, forcing himself to hold back.__*


[3/3/2025 8:10 PM] Cat Bayes
*Meanwhile, Cat was just...watching as the workers passed them by, glaring at their lifeless expressions as they shuffled by like zombies. She seemed...horrified? Sad? It was hard to tell...*


[3/3/2025 8:47 PM] Narration
The contingent of 'people' continued past them. Their well-hidden positions kept even the trained eyes of the Legonaries away from them. Soon, they vanished into the fog. They were safe for now... What the hell was that place they came from... and why were they like that?


[3/3/2025 8:50 PM] Cat Bayes
**"..."** *Cat was quiet, her hood concealing whatever emotion her face might show in the given moment. She was clearly bothered by the contingent of husks that'd just passed them, but whatever was on her mind was being kept to herself.*


[3/3/2025 9:06 PM] Narration
Cat would receive a message. However, the sender's ID was obfuscated. Would she dare open a message from an unknown sender?


[3/3/2025 9:10 PM] Cat Bayes
**"Huh?"** *The sudden ping in her ears snapped her out of whatever trance she was in, as she stared at the holographic display of her inbox with the message sitting there. Reaching out, she tugged on Cole's sleeve with a hushed tone.* **"Hey, just got a weird message all of a sudden."**


[3/3/2025 9:17 PM] Ghost
*Ghost’s gaze flicked down to her hand on his sleeve. His expression remained unreadable beneath the mask.*

**“. . .”**


[3/3/2025 9:21 PM] Cat Bayes
**". . ."** *Cat prided herself on being a competent netrunner, and knew she could defend herself from attacks well enough...but this felt off. If someone was trying to attack her, then they wouldn't have made themselves known, and if they were attempting to track them, then they were already found.*

*Fuck it, they weren't in any spot to hesitate over shit like this right now. With a simple thought sent to her mind, she opened the message.*


[3/3/2025 9:25 PM] Narration
`832, Bain Rd. Go there.` A map attachment was included with the message. The format appended at the end seemed legit. it was up to her to accept the attachment file.

**"...We've got a location."** *Cat said, giving Cole a wary look.* **"832, Bain Rd...with a map attachment."**

*Well, we're already this far in. Without any other course of action, she opened the attachment.*


[3/3/2025 9:29 PM] Ghost
**"Your call. If you think it's safe, then lead the way."** *he said, his voice low and firm.*


[3/3/2025 9:30 PM] Ghost
*If she did decide to go to that location, then Ghost would just follow.*


[3/3/2025 9:43 PM] Narration
Cat opened the attachment and suddenly, the path became clear to her. It wasn't far away. At least there was some sense of direction within this blanket of fog.


[3/3/2025 9:45 PM] Cat Bayes
*Cat breathed an internal sigh of relief as the attachment opened as she would expect it to, but that didn't mean they were out of the woods yet. There's still the matter of the mysterious sender.*

*Looking back over, she gave her companion a nod.* **"Got no other choice in the matter, it's our only lead as of right now."** *With that, she began to lead the way to their new "friend" in the mist.*

The location they were given was warehouse... All the doors were sealed, saved for one slightly opened door on the side of the building.

**"..."** *Cat was watching the building with a discerning glare, as if trying to spot something out of the ordinary. The quiet atmosphere wasn't helping the butterflies in her stomach, but they were literally out of options here.*

*She glanced over towards Cole, were they doing this?*


[3/3/2025 10:04 PM] Ghost
*Ghost examined the door closely, noting subtle signs that someone had entered recently. Had they simply forgotten to close it, or was it left ajar on purpose, to bait them in? Too many possibilities, but only one way to get answers. __He had to go in.__*  

*Without turning his head, he addressed Cat in a low, measured tone.* **"I'll go in alone. You stay back and find cover. If I don’t come out in five minutes, assume I’m __dead__ and move on. Otherwise, wait for my signal."**


[3/3/2025 10:06 PM] Cat Bayes
**"...Fine, but don't think I'm super thrilled about leaving you for dead, Cole."** *Cat wanted to argue with his logic, but she was way too out of her element to even consider another option right now. With a nod indicating that the plan was set, she moved to a spot that was well covered and watched him from afar.*


[3/3/2025 10:07 PM] Ghost
**"Hold it."**


[3/3/2025 10:07 PM] Cat Bayes
**"Huh?"**


[3/3/2025 10:10 PM] Ghost
*Now that he had her attention, Ghost remembered one last thing. Without a word, he tossed his rifle to Cat, expecting her to catch it. He needed to stay light and mobile in case things went south. Whether she caught it or not, he had already made up his mind, switching to his __dual handguns.__*

*Turning back to the door, he silently widened the gap, his movements controlled. Just before stepping inside, he activated his **cybernetic ability.***


[3/3/2025 10:13 PM] Cat Bayes
**"Guh!"** *She was expecting a scolding, not a gun to be tossed her way! That's super fucking dangerous, dude!*

*Cat fumbled a bit, outstretching her hands to receive the incoming rifle - which she did! It wasn't the most graceful catch, but she'd be damned if she mistreated one of Ghostgaze's guns...even if it was out of nowhere.*


[3/3/2025 10:21 PM] Narration
The warehouse was empty, except for a cube in the very center of the warehouse. There was a skywalk suspended roughly 30 feet in the air, overlooking the entire warehouse. There were no additional rooms, no corridors. Just a warehouse meant for storage things...


[3/3/2025 10:25 PM] Ghost
*Ghost took in the scene quickly, his eyes scanning every inch of the warehouse. It was too open, too exposed. A single cube sitting in the dead center? That wasn’t right. His instincts screamed at him, this must be a setup.*

*His gaze flicked up to the skywalk, noting its vantage point. If someone was watching, that’s where they’d be. Yet, there were no signs of movement. No shadows shifting. Just silence? Still, he wasn’t about to take any chances. Keeping his steps light, he advanced cautiously, guns at the ready. He wasn’t walking into this blind.*


[3/3/2025 10:26 PM] Narration
Ghost had to use a ladder to ascend to the skywalk. The warehouse was well-lit, there was NOWHERE for someone to hide.


[3/3/2025 10:31 PM] Ghost
*Ghost remained low, his body pressed against the surface, relying on his enhanced cybernetic ability to stay undetected. His eyes remained fixed on the centre of the warehouse, watching every angle. The silence was unnerving, but he couldn't afford to let his guard down. After a brief pause, his voice came through the comms with a calm, controlled tone.* `"No threats in sight. Warehouse is clear, but there's an unknown object in the center. I have eyes on it. Proceed with caution and engage."` *His grip tightened around his handguns, ready to react if things escalated.*


[3/3/2025 10:36 PM] Cat Bayes
*After a few second delay, Cat's voice came through with a response.* `"On it, entering the warehouse.`

*Cole didn't have to wait long after that, as the faint squeak of a metal door creaking open could be heard from the entrance, and the silhouette of a little netrunner girl was shadowed by the grey light outside.*

*After closing the door behind her, she slowly she made her way inside, immediately locking her eyes on the metal box in the center of the room. She couldn't see Cole anywhere, but she assumed he was either using his cybernetics or he was up in the skywalk...or both. Well, nothing left to do other than approach.*


[3/3/2025 10:42 PM] Narration
As soon as Cat grew nearer to the box,

-# blink! 

A light flashed from the dome of the cube, and an outward projection of a man emerged!


[3/3/2025 10:42 PM] Quincy
**"Oh good, I was right to assume you were somewhat competent at following directions."** The image was a full-body projection of... some guy with illuminating eyes and in a well-pressed suit. His arms behind his back as he regarded Cat.


[3/3/2025 10:46 PM] Cat Bayes
**"Oh for fucks sake-"** *Cat's suspension was immediately replaced by aggravation at the first glance of this guy, even if it was a hologram. Well tailored suit, condescending voice, and the posture of an ass kissing middle manager? It was all Cat needed.* **"You a corpo?"** *She asked, the annoyance plain in her voice.*


[3/3/2025 10:46 PM] Ghost
*No sounds or any form of movement on Cole's end.*


[3/3/2025 10:48 PM] Quincy
**"Corpo? Are you so dense that you honestly believe a corpo would have any interest in a freelance netrunner with not much going for her portoflio? Please..."**


[3/3/2025 10:49 PM] Cat Bayes
*Eye twitch, but continue.*


[3/3/2025 10:50 PM] Quincy
He'd roll his eyes, before focusing on the skywalk before fluttering down towards Cat dramatically. **"Rhetorical quesiton. Obviously."**


[3/3/2025 10:52 PM] Quincy
**"You're Cat Bayes, 23 years of age and used to operate an braindance storefront. On the back-end, however, you acquired some... confidential recordings which ended in disaster, no?"**


[3/3/2025 10:54 PM] Cat Bayes
**"...Sure."** *Cat responded with a defensive tone, her glare locked on the man like daggers.* **"The fuck do you want with me?"**

*There was still a chance he didn't know Cole was here, she had to keep it that way.*


[3/3/2025 10:57 PM] Quincy
**"Very little at first, until I saw you snoopin' around Underwood's cache. It was quite ingenious how you hijacked the credentials, bypassing authentication with a 199X_SST protocol in place."**


[3/3/2025 11:00 PM] Cat Bayes
*...Well shit, Cat thought she'd covered all her tracks pretty well back then. Guess she got a bit carried away.* **"So you've been watching me for that long, huh? Kinda creepy, choomba."**

*This guy was seriously giving her the ick in all the worst spots. Just how long has he been keeping an eye on her, and for what purpose?*


[3/3/2025 11:03 PM] Quincy
**"Then, allow me to snag your full-undivided attention."** There was a dramatic pause. 
**"Benedict Kensington is the name of who burned down your little operation."**


[3/3/2025 11:10 PM] Cat Bayes
*Cat's eyes widened and her breath hitched in her throat. An anger that she hadn't felt since the fire swelled within her chest, and it took everything in her power to keep it from spilling out.*

*That blonde fucker's face appeared in her mind, and now she had a name. Maybe more if she played her cards right.*


[3/3/2025 11:10 PM] Cat Bayes
**"Go on..."** *She replied, her tone dark and low. He had her undivided attention now.*

The man leaned in slightly, letting the weight of his words settle before continuing.
**"Benedict Kensington is untouchable,"** he said, his voice smooth, almost amused by her reaction. "**You could try to go after him yourself, but you'd be dead before you even got close. Or worse, they'd make you disappear in a way that ensures no one even remembers you existed. Including your friends."**

He let that sink in, watching as the fire in her eyes burned.

**"But me? I can get you what you need. Credentials, names, access—anything."** He spread his hands, like a dealer laying out cards. **"You want to make Kensington pay? You’re going to need the right doors unlocked at just the right time. And I can do that for you."**

His gaze locked onto hers, steady, unwavering. **"But nothing comes free. Help me with what I need, and I’ll hand you the data to fry his circuits beyond recovery. I'll even give you a ticket out of Monita as well."**


[3/3/2025 11:24 PM] Cat Bayes
*The netrunner was quiet for a moment or two, letting the weight of his words sink deep into her mind. Her head hung ever so slightly lower, eyes tracing the the cracks and grout lines across the cold cement floor. A way to get back at that bastard - Benedict - and a ticket out of Monita for her and Cole. Only for the price of being his obedient little lapdog.*

*It sounded too good to be true.*

*She glanced up at him, the dim glow of her azure eyes piercing through the shadow of her bangs.* **"How do I know I can trust you? Why are you doing this?"**

The door they entered through then opened.


[3/3/2025 11:26 PM] Quincy
**"Excuse me.."** The man in the hologram was in the flesh, entering the warehouse.


[3/3/2025 11:27 PM] Cat Bayes
*Cat whipped her head around, ready to anticipate whatever ambush walked into the facility.*

*But no, it was him - just him.*


[3/3/2025 11:27 PM] Cat Bayes
*Somehow, this felt worse.*


[3/3/2025 11:27 PM] Quincy
**"Tell your friend to ease up a little."** He would adjust his tie as he strode towards her.


[3/3/2025 11:27 PM] Ghost
*Ghost kept his handguns trained on Quincy, waiting for Cat’s signal or any sudden movement to fire.*


[3/3/2025 11:29 PM] Cat Bayes
**"You-..."** *He even knew about Cole, too? The knowledge this man had almost felt omnipotent, it was enough to make her gulp a little.*

*After a minute of staring into his eyes, she waved Cole down.* **"It's...It's alright, I don't think he's here to hurt us."**


[3/3/2025 11:31 PM] Quincy
**"What was that question you asked a moment ago? Ah, yes.... How could you trust me. Well, to put it simply. I should introduce myself, I would assume that would be __enough__ to sate this inquiry."** With a quick flick of his wrists, he would adjust his cuffs. **"I am Quincy, a CCR Inspector here in Monita. If I __REALLY__ wanted either of you fried to a crisp, or taken out. I would have done so once you led me back to your... 'hideout'."**


[3/3/2025 11:32 PM] Quincy
**"I've been investigating the mystery that has been, Underwood.. You see. It's quite amazing how many of your kind are amassing in District 9. Quite poetic if you were to ask me."**


[3/3/2025 11:33 PM] Quincy
**"But, enough about that... I have withheld that information from my constituents."**


[3/3/2025 11:33 PM] Ghost
*He descended the ladder, his movements deliberate and slow. His guns were lowered slightly as he walked, each footstep reverberating through the quiet warehouse. His red eyes cut through the darkness, scanning the surroundings, until he was fully illuminated in the centre.*


[3/3/2025 11:33 PM] Quincy
**"Why? Because we can help each other."**


[3/3/2025 11:35 PM] Ghost
*Ghost holstered his handguns and extended his hands, signaling for Cat to return his rifle. His gaze remained fixed on Quincy, cautious.*


[3/3/2025 11:41 PM] Cat Bayes
**"..."** *It was safe to say that Cat wasn't feeling too good about __any__ of what she heard. Her mouth felt dry, and her head was left spinning. This Quincy guy, a CCR inspector, had not only known about their hideouts this entire time...but withheld this information from his peers? He could've ended Horizon Grey even before the start.*

*Feeling Cole by her side now, she noticed he was requesting his gun back. She took a hold of the sling over her shoulder and pulled it over her head, handing it back to him before turning back to Quincy.*

**"Why do you want our help taking down Benedict, aren't you guys supposed to be on the same side?"** *She needed answers, it felt wrong having so many questions. It felt wrong being this __powerless.__* **"What do you have to gain from all this?"**


[3/3/2025 11:47 PM] Quincy
He would start to laugh, **"Same side? I’m wounded to hear that you believe there are sides. It’s all superficial."**

He would walk the perimeter of the two. **"Truth of the matter is that you only side with aligns with your immediate needs. And frankly, Corpo’s don’t align with what I need."**

He would come to a stop, **"the moment these walls are breached. You would come to realize that the upper government will ferry all of their friends off to other districts. The CCR is nothing more than a tool."**


[3/3/2025 11:51 PM] Quincy
**"You don’t even know what’s going on… None of you do. I believe you have an idea but it’s only a fraction of what is the come. You want to live, get revenge, or leave your mark somewhere you ultimately align yourself with those who can achieve this. And I’m that guy."**


[3/3/2025 11:52 PM] Quincy
**"If you want answers, I need results. I think I’ve proven myself more than trustworthy."**


[3/3/2025 11:55 PM] Ghost
*Ghost glanced over at Cat, waiting for her response. Truth be told, he wasn’t particularly interested in the conversation, but he knew cooperating with this man might be their best shot at survival. He still didn’t trust Quincy, but that decision was hers to make.*


[3/4/2025 6:45 PM] Cat Bayes
*Cat exchanged the glance with Cole for a moment before looking down. There was clearly a lot of things going through her mind at this very moment, but at the forefront was Benedict. Trap or not, this was most likely going to be the closest she'll ever get to taking her revenge, and she wasn't going to pass that up.*

*Shifting her focus back to Quincy, she gave a big exhale with closed eyes, and finally opened them once she gathered her resolve.* **"Alright, I'll help, as long as you promise to hold your end of the bargain when it's over."**


[3/4/2025 7:01 PM] Quincy
**"We'll start with my end of the bargain. Your ticket to __freedom__."** He'd turn his palm upwards, and swept horizontally towards them.


[3/4/2025 7:01 PM] Narration
Cat and Ghost received one-time use clearance credentials. The notifications swept across their eyes.


[3/4/2025 7:01 PM] Quincy
**"You'll need to lose the weapons if you want to get through."**


[3/4/2025 7:05 PM] Quincy
**"Now. As to what I __need__ from __you__, Bayes."** He would clear his throat. **"Are you familiar with what Spikes are?"**


[3/4/2025 7:06 PM] Cat Bayes
**"Spikes?"** *Cat parroted, watching as the notification for the credentials swept past her eyes. Seems like she didn't know what they were.*


[3/4/2025 7:14 PM] Ghost
*The thought of losing his weapons was what displeased Ghost the most. **He felt exposed,** just like when Freddie Dawson had restrained him. His only response was a low grunt. With a sharp motion, Ghost tossed the rifle aside to his left, then followed suit with his handguns. **It stung to relinquish them,** but he was willing to compromise when necessary. Once unarmed, he made his way behind to one of the large empty crates and began changing.*


[3/4/2025 7:16 PM] Quincy
He'd sigh audibly, reaching into his suit jacket, producing a seemingly standard shard chip you would insert into your neural deck. **"Spikes are shards embedded with a highly sophisticated program, designed to lock away sections of an individual’s mind. They don’t just encrypt thoughts—they alter the very 'language' of the neurons, rendering information incomprehensible to both the user and any external attempts at extraction. Traditional decryption methods are useless against them. Even with the best tech, cracking just a fragment of the locked data would take hundreds of man-hours—if not more."**


[3/4/2025 7:17 PM] Quincy
**"It's perfect for keeping a information broker from squeakin' if their ass is compromised. A simple slot and you protect priceless data."**


[3/4/2025 7:19 PM] Quincy
**"Makes sense?"**


[3/4/2025 7:30 PM] Cat Bayes
*A deep sigh emanated from the somewhat frustrated netrunner as she pinched her temple.* **"Yeah, no, makes sense that you guys would come up with something like that."** *At this point, she wasn't even surprised anymore.*

**"So, what does this 'Spike' have anything to do with this?"** *She had a feeling, but it was better to get confirmation first.*


[3/4/2025 7:34 PM] Quincy
**"A connection of mine went dark. I assume, they spiked themselves in order to protect their affiliation with me. Something that I instructed them to do, yes. But the timing is horrid. I need that information before __it__ happens."**


[3/4/2025 7:37 PM] Quincy
He would procure a second shard from his jacket. **"Whenever I have spikes made, I make a reversal spike. Encoded within the same parameters, but does the opposite. You will go to my connections home, have them slot it, or slot it yourself, it matters not to me. Afterwards, your work will be done."**


[3/4/2025 7:37 PM] Quincy
**"Get this done and you may ask me any question under the blasted sun. I will even get you close to Benedict."**


[3/4/2025 7:41 PM] Cat Bayes
*Cat eyed the so-called "reversal spike" pinched between his fingers, casting a suspicious glance at first before looking back up to Quincy with folded arms. She's had harder jobs in the past, sure, but if there's anything she's learned from people like these...is that there's a catch.* **"Sounds simple enough, but I need more details. Where does this guy even live?"**


[3/4/2025 7:43 PM] Cole Mercer
*Cole emerged from the darkness once more, his imposing 6’5” frame cutting through the light. His long, jet black hair draped over his shoulders, some strands falling over his pale face. Shadows clung to his features, further accentuating the sharp angles of his jawline and cheekbones.*

*Dressed in a heavy, black trench coat that barely shifted with his movements. His eyes, barely visible beneath the strands of unkempt hair, burned with a quiet intensity. His gloved hands, now empty of weapons, twitched slightly, as if instinctively yearning for the cold steel of his firearms. Even unarmed, Cole exuded a presence that made the air feel heavier. He still carried his duffle bag, it's possible that his mask may be in there.*

*His voice came low and direct, devoid of any excess emotion.*

**"Name."**

[3/4/2025 7:53 PM] Quincy
He blinked and a digital image of their target burned into their retinas. Same with her current. **"She... lives in Fairview. Someone who you would call, a online streamer. Aurora King is her name. 21 years of age and is on my payroll for information. She isn't a threat, but those who she is connected with are. And I do not say that lightly."**

He would take his glasses off to clean them. **"Once her memories come back to her, she will do the rest. Try not to damage the woman, I much rather not have her father calling upon me to investigate you. We all know how that would end."**

[3/4/2025 8:00 PM] Cole Mercer
*[He took a step forward, his imposing frame casting a long shadow over Quincy.](https://youtu.be/kfy8KOi2ick?si=y7WEXfvICDGwponN) It wasn’t a move meant to intimidate, just to make his stance clear. His voice remained flat, cutting straight to the point.*

**"No __promises.__ But I expect compensation for my gear. __You know what we pulled in Fairview.__"**

[3/4/2025 8:12 PM] Cat Bayes
**"Wait, __Aurora King__ works for you?!"** *Cat raised her voice in recognition of the name, her arms unfolding and her eyes growing wide. It's like the last piece of a puzzle she'd long struggled with had just fit into place.* **"Holy fucking shit, it makes way too much sense now..."**


[3/4/2025 8:26 PM] Quincy
Once he put his glasses back on, he would flick the shard over Cat's way with his thumb.


[3/4/2025 8:27 PM] Cat Bayes
*Cat caught the shard with a quick swing of her fist, the small device landing perfectly in her palm with a mechanical thud. She opened her hand, staring at it for a moment.*


[3/4/2025 8:30 PM] Quincy
Quincy would finally regard Cole. **"This is a job that I have assigned Ms. Bayes to. There will be __no__ compensation for you coming from me since she is the one I sought after. Be thankful that I even given you the credentials to leave Monita. Consider that compensation __enough__."**


[3/4/2025 8:32 PM] Cole Mercer
*Cole let out a low grunt, offering no real reaction to Quincy's rambling.*

[3/4/2025 8:41 PM] Cat Bayes
*Easy Cole, Cat can share the reward with ya later. That being said, it's about time we figure out next steps.* **"Alright, so...get into Aurora's apartment, slot the reverse spike into her neck, and get the info for you?"** *Cat reiterated, to make sure everything was in order.* **"And what after that? How do you want us to reach you?"**


[3/4/2025 8:43 PM] Quincy
**"After that, we go our seperate ways; I will give you instructions on how to get to Benedict. You'll do fuck all with those instructions I give you and we never met. Simple."**


[3/4/2025 8:44 PM] Cat Bayes
**"Yeah, simple."** *Nothing is ever simple with these fuckbags, but at least she can get behind the never seeing him again part.*

*She looks over towards Cole, pocketing the reverse shard.* **"Well...I guess we should get moving. The faster we get out of this shit hole the better."**


[3/4/2025 8:48 PM] Cole Mercer
*Cole let out a low grunt once more, waiting for Cat to make a move. He left the initiative to her.*


[3/4/2025 8:49 PM] Cat Bayes
*Giving one last accusatory glance to Quincy, she adjusted her hoodie and started making her way past him. She didn't feel safe with the CCR inspector at her back like that...they needed to move out of there.*


[3/4/2025 8:51 PM] Cole Mercer
*Cole followed. Just before stepping out of the warehouse, he cast a final side-eye at Quincy, __likely__ the last time he would ever see him. His black sclera and small white pupil lingered on him for a brief moment before shifting back to Cat as they moved on.*

[3/4/2025 9:00 PM] Cat Bayes
*Once they had moved a substantial distance from the warehouse, Cat stopped and turned to Cole with a rather concerned glance. They'd just been dropped __several__ bombshell revelations, and it looks like she wanted to discuss.* **"We need to update Kode on the situation, alright with you?"** *She asked.*


[3/4/2025 9:05 PM] Cole Mercer
*Cole leaned back against the wall, arms crossed, his gaze fixed on the ground. His response was blunt.* **"Do whatever you want."**


[3/4/2025 9:06 PM] Cat Bayes
*She nodded, before her eyes flashed their usual vibrant orange glow. Cole noticed that he had an incoming group call coming from Cat, including Kode.*


[3/4/2025 9:07 PM] Cole Mercer
*He accepted.*


[3/4/2025 9:10 PM] Kode
`"That didn't take long. What is going on?"` He picked up.


[3/4/2025 9:15 PM] Cat Bayes
`"We got an update, but I'm not sure if I should call it good or bad news."` *She looked over towards Cole, before looking back down at the ground.* `"I got a message from a mystery sender, with GPS cords and a location. Sent us to a warehouse where we met a uh...'unlikely' friend."`

`"Know anything about a CCR inspector named Quincy?"`


[3/4/2025 9:18 PM] Kode
`"No. You met with the CCR? Tell me you're lying to me."`


[3/4/2025 9:19 PM] Cat Bayes
`"If we knew the shit head was CCR, I wouldn't have gone in the first place."` *Cat sighed, she was expecting this reaction from Kode.* `"The news doesn't really get any better...Kode, he's known about our new hideout since the beginning."`


[3/4/2025 9:22 PM] Kode
`"...What else did we learn?"` He'll get back to that later...


[3/4/2025 9:42 PM] Cat Bayes
`"It seems like the CCR, or at least this Quincy schmuck, don't like the fact that the Corpo's are disbanding and tearing apart the CCR. We also met their replacement too...the Vesperian Legion. They were escorting...uh...I dunno how to explain it, it was like they were a pack of mindless, soulless office workers. They barely looked alive."`

`"In exchange for a way out of Monita, Quincy wants us to handle a job for him."` *Huh, she left out Benedict.* `"He wants us to go to Fairview to find his informant: Aurora King. Apparently, she took something called a Spike: a type of Shard the CCR developed to completely rewrite neurons in the brain and lock memories behind a set of insanely complex encryptions. Fortunately, he just gave us the "Reverse Spike" to undo the effect."`

[3/4/2025 9:52 PM] Kode
`"Spikes...Yeah, I am familiar with them. Though, they aren't on the streets... What you were seeing from those 'office workers' is a subset of a similar product."`

There was a massive pause. 

`"Paige would kill me if I overwhelmed you. But it is important for you to know... Monita is one big factory. Those people you saw, are most likely lesser drones. Doing civil tasks for the Vesperian Legion so that their combatants can continue churning soldiers out for their war beyond the walls."`

`"That manditory firmware initative you've probably been hearing about... Is certainly a last ditch effort to amass a drone army beyond imagination. In other words, they intend for all of us to become one of those things..."`

`"If this Quincy guy did not give you a time limit, I suggest you return back here... I could explain everything in better detail that way."`

WHAT THE FUCK HAPPENED WHEN I WAS GONE


[3/4/2025 9:53 PM] kazito_kaz
WAIT

BRO


[3/4/2025 10:04 PM] Cat Bayes
*So he knew about the Spike, then that makes things easier. Still, hearing words like 'lesser drones' thrown around put an uneasy grimace on Cat's face, her fists clenching tightly. Things were lining up perfectly: the destruction of Haven Heights and Fairview, the amassing army of 'lesser drones' to build their new vesperian legion, the expansion efforts beyond the wall? The corpos were tired of being treated like mere mortals, and wanted to ascend to a higher status. It made Cat sick to her stomach.*

*There was a pause from her, before she managed to continue.* `"Y-Yeah, we'll come to you first...and, I've got something I wanna talk to you about once we get back. It concerns Biotek."`


[3/4/2025 10:05 PM] Kode
`"Stay safe."` *Disconnected*


[3/4/2025 10:07 PM] Cat Bayes
**"You too."** *Cat said in response, before leaning her back against the wall, holding her palm over her eyes with a small groan.* **"...Fuck."**


[3/4/2025 10:08 PM] Cole Mercer
*He disconnected without a word, as there was no real need for him to say anything further. Cole then turned his attention to Cat...*


[3/4/2025 10:09 PM] Cat Bayes
*The netrunner seemed...tired? Frustrated? Maybe a bit of both, but it was hard to tell what was going on in her head without directly asking her. Something's definitely been bothering her ever since their run in with the Vesperian Legion and the drones, but it was up to Cole whether or not he wanted to pry or move on.*


[3/4/2025 10:11 PM] Cole Mercer
*A third grunt escaped him. He hated wasting time on unnecessary distractions when there was an objective at hand. Still, he __couldn't__ ignore it.*

**"What is it now?"** *he asked bluntly.*


[3/4/2025 10:16 PM] Cat Bayes
*Hearing that, Cat lowered her fingers for her eye to peak through, looking over at Cole. She shook her head, lowering her hand to her side before using her offhand to rub at her arm. She pushed herself off the wall and faced the man properly.* **"It's...nothing. This place just brings up bad memories for me, I'm good to keep moving."**


[3/4/2025 10:18 PM] Cole Mercer
*Cole gave her a quick, sharp glance, but said nothing in response. He could tell something was off, but it wasn’t his place to press. If she didn’t want to talk about it, then so be it.*

**"Let's move."** *he said, his tone cold and direct.*


[3/4/2025 10:21 PM] Cat Bayes
**"Yeah."** *Don't have to tell her twice. She moved alongside Cole with a determined pace.*
