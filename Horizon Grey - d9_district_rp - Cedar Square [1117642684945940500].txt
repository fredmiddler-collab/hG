Kaedues found himself out on the streets of Fairview, more specifically, Cedar Square. When people thought of the Utopia of Vespera this was it. The streets were clean, the skies were clear, and there were not many cars out on the roads. Many people chose public transit, bullet trains flying across in the backdrop or simply walking the sidewalks. The life of the middle class, so quite so surreal.

At times there were more Lawmen than there were civilians. Their drones nosily flying over people to scan them and projecting the typical propaganda the CCR loves to amplify every few minutes. Now Kaedues stands out on the sidewalk taking in these sights.


[6/13/2023 2:39 PM] Kaedues Staub
*Each step in Fairview feels strange to Kaedues. If only those buildings were greyer, and dirtier. Despite his grievances though, Kaedues begins walking with the flow of traffic on the sidewalk. He looks out for people who are asking for help, or people who look like they need it.*

*On his way through Fairview Kaedues brings up his playlist and hits shuffle. It spits a quiet song at him so he can listen while he walks.*

[6/14/2023 11:26 PM] Narration
As Kaedues Staub ambled down the neatly maintained streets of Fairview, the world seemed to function like a well-oiled machine. People walked with purpose, their steps perfectly in sync with the rhythmic hum of the bullet trains zipping past. The intricate architecture of the buildings, with their polished glass and gleaming metal, seemed to defy the very notion of imperfection. A stark contrast to the grime and disarray of the places Kaedues was used to. In Haven Heights, there is always something to fix but here.. It was like the place __was__ Kaedues. Always on time, always on point.

Kaedues was an outsider to Fairview; it was evident in the way he moved. His attire, which was more rugged and worn compared to the polished and clean fashion of the locals, made him conspicuous. This did not go unnoticed by the local law enforcement.

The Lawmen in Fairview were always on high alert. The area was not just any neighborhood; it was the jewel of District 9, the epitome of the Utopian vision that the CCR aimed to project. The Lawmen were, therefore, as vigilant as sentinels. As Kaedues strolled, he could feel their scrutinizing gazes fixed on him. Drones buzzed past him at intervals, scanning him with a precision that left no room for anonymity.


[6/15/2023 12:04 PM] Kaedues Staub
*Walking through Fairview feels like a chore in of itself to Kaedues. It isn't the first time and it won't be the last time he visits... unfortunately. Some part of him, far within, enjoys seeing the city so self sufficient. This part is however completely overshadowed by Kaedues' drive to work.*

*Before he can find himself complaining, he notices the odd looks. Normally he doesn't mind things like that-- he usually looks gross and grimey so it's normal to be looked at like a piece of filth. Here in Fairview though this kind of attention might hurt his job hunting... it warrants more attention than usual. With that said Kaedues begins searching for a clothing store here in Fairview to spend his hard earned cash on.*


[6/17/2023 1:29 AM] Narration
There was no clothing store within his gaze where he stood the moment he initiated his search. It was not until he reached the second block where he saw a sign arched over a portion of the sidewalk. It read, "Starlit Wardrobes".  Mannequins lined the digitized windows flashing the prices of the attire on display in such a way that was meant to lure the attention of anyone striding by.


[6/17/2023 1:36 PM] Kaedues Staub
*Kaedues takes a deep breath. Most of these clothing stores will have odd sounding names to Kaedues.*

*With that said, Kaedues makes haste to enter the shop.*\


[6/17/2023 3:29 PM] Narration
The store was undoubtedly high-end. The floors were impeccably clean, and every piece of fabric, trim, and thread was neatly arranged. Some customers were browsing the merchandise in person while others were using drones to virtually try on clothes. The women's section was on the left, and the men's on the right, with clear signage. Walking down the central path with marble-like flooring would lead him straight to the front counter.


[6/17/2023 4:50 PM] Kaedues Staub
*Without speaking, Kaedues navigates to the mens' section of the store. Kaedues is specifically looking for a tracksuit. Something that he could run in, should he want to.*

*Does he see anything like what he is looking for?*


[6/17/2023 5:00 PM] Narration
There were few sports outfits out for display. However, there was a kiosk that some of the other customers were using that provided catalogs of getups. Underneath the screen was a rectangle-like cutout that one would assume that the outfit would come out from there. Either way, the outfits were limited on physical display.


[6/17/2023 5:12 PM] Kaedues Staub
*Kaedues walks up to a kiosk and tightly shuts his eyes for a moment. He's still in a lot of pain from yesterday despite his efforts to parade around like nothing happened. He's still cut up and bruised-- he looks worse than he did yesterday... complexion wise at least.*

*His eyes slowly adjust to the screen. What kind of getups are showcased with the kiosk?*


[6/17/2023 11:06 PM] Narration
Seems like the last person to use the kisok happened to have last browsed the sport section. The following Outfits were on display...

[6/18/2023 11:38 PM] Kaedues Staub
*Kaedues isn't a fan of navigating these bright and annoying screens when he can help it. His eyes fixate quickly on the red outfit though and Kaedues moves to examine it further.*

*Kaedues wants to stand out to these people, but not so much that they think he's disgusting. He likes the straightforward look of the red tracksuit and what attention it may bring to him. Is there any more available information about the tracksuit?*


[6/19/2023 12:47 AM] Narration
His eyes focused on the outfit. Registering his interest, the item would expand on the screen, along with information regarding the outfit.

**Price: 899 ₥R with store membership.**
**Price: 1,700 ₥R without store membership.**


[6/19/2023 6:44 PM] Kaedues Staub
*Kaedues' eyebrows sway up when he sees the price of the outfit. Almost two grand??? For a tracksuit and runners???*

*Not happy with it, Kaedues walks over to the cashier himself. Is anyone in line? And what kind of people are they, if there is a line?*


[6/19/2023 8:43 PM] Narration
There was only one person waiting in line. The cashier and a woman who seemed to be around the same age as Kaedues, maybe younger and were engaged in a friendly conversation, indicating that they knew each other. Their body language and tone suggested that it was a casual chat.


[6/19/2023 8:43 PM] Aurora King
The woman with the white hair had her weight shifted to one leg, her eyes lighting up as she browsed and held the said friendly conversation with the cashier. **"So, I told my agent no. I won't team with some fucking corpse who doesn't know a thing or two about Solar Knights IV. Might as well play with the low-level bourgies who can't even play as a kleptoid."**


[6/19/2023 8:43 PM] Jer
The man running the counter seemed more entuned with the woman's complaints than working. **"Going to be real hard trying to find anyone in the edgezone that will be good enough to join you on stream. Ever get that issue at your place fixed?"**


[6/19/2023 8:43 PM] Aurora King
Her eyes widened with a roll before the blink and relaxation came about her expression, **"Haven't even looked. Some gunks who know who I am will come around eventually. Just a simple leak, nothing to get one's chip short-circed."**


[6/19/2023 8:43 PM] Narration
Potential job opprotunity for Kaedues?

[6/19/2023 9:22 PM] Kaedues Staub
*Kaedues overhears the little conversation between.... Probably a live streamer and an art major. He almost tunes it out but then... But then, Kaedues hears it.*

***'Issue'.***

*The gopher quickly pieces together the context he initially discarded. What to others would be a non thought is an opportunity to Kaedues. He holds his bruised left arm upwards with his palm forward as a greeting; Kaedues speaks up.* **"You need help fixing something?"** *He says while looking at this pale girl.*

[6/19/2023 9:53 PM] Aurora King
With a graceful motion, she gracefully swung her head, her hair flowing behind her like a captivating waterfall as she turned her gaze towards the eavesdropping man. A look of curiosity and puzzlement filled her eyes, silently questioning his presence. However, a tinge of concern also flickered within her, as she pondered intently about the identity and intentions of the mysterious figure.  **"And who are you?"**


[6/19/2023 9:55 PM] Jer
Jer, who had been standing behind the counter, diverted his attention away from Aurora and shifted his gaze towards the peculiar man. A subtle hint of annoyance flickered across his face, evident that the unexpected intrusion had disrupted his cherished moment spent with a dear friend. His disapproving eyes scanned the stranger's appearance, betraying a hint of judgement towards the man's rather unconventional appearance.

*Kaedues plants his feet and slips his hand into his pocket. He takes a breath in and feels a strange tingle up his spine. He had almost forgot what it felt like to present himself to someone else.*

*The red-haired man locks eyes with Aurora and raises his chin to present his face. He raises his left hand and uses his thumb to point to himself.* **"Call me the Caliber Man,"** *he answers coolly.* **"I overheard you have a problem."** *Kaedues takes a step forward, now at a comfortable distance instead of farther away.* **"I'll fix it for you."**


[6/19/2023 10:03 PM] Kaedues Staub
*His stare is direct and straightforward, a gesture that might disrupt people not ready to look back at him. With Kaedues, his honesty is often suspiciously blatant.*


[6/19/2023 10:15 PM] Aurora King
**"Oh my goodness, he actually has a handle?"** She exclaimed, a genuine suprise evident in her tone, as she turned towards Jer, seeking a moment of shared astonishment.


[6/19/2023 10:15 PM] Jer
His gaze briefly returned to Aurora, sharing a knowing glance, while the corner of his mouth curled up unapologetically. After that fleeting exchange,


[6/19/2023 10:15 PM] Aurora King
With a subtle chuckle, she redirected her attention back to Kaedues. The smile would drop with a directness that cut through the air, she uttered bluntly,**"You look like shit— Oh!"** Her demeanor swiftly shifted as she regained her buoyant disposition. **"Well, you're a handyman after all, so that's to be expected. Speaking of which, how much would it cost to have my sink pipes repaired? They're leaking like crazy!"** she exclaimed, a touch of urgency lacing her voice.


[6/19/2023 10:31 PM] Kaedues Staub
*Kaedues doesn't even flinch when she insults him, nor does he miss a beat. While Aurora turns to look at Jer, Kaedues takes another step towards the girl. His arm returns to his side and his eyes remain fixed on her head.*

*When she asks about money, Kaedues pipes up.* **"14₥R /h."** *His price might come to shock Aurora.*


[6/19/2023 10:38 PM] Aurora King
**"14 ₥R?!"** She exclaimed, her voice infused with disbelief. Was he really charging that cheaply?! Casting a sideways glance at him, she regarded him with suspicion. **"You cannot be from around here, offering such ridiculously low prices like a stiff."**


[6/19/2023 10:43 PM] Kaedues Staub
**"Then I'm not from around here. Do you want better, faster work for this low of a cost?"** *Kaedues tries to pressure her lightly with the question. He keeps his gaze fixed on her as if he's watching her every move, every little adjustment she makes with her face.*

*He wants to say more, to reel her in, but he refrains. His excitement coils around him as he speaks and as he waits.*


[6/19/2023 10:52 PM] Aurora King
**"I'm quite surprised they allowed you to venture this far into Fairview,"** she remarked, a hint of astonishment coloring her words. **"Typically, they tend to round your kind up."**

At that very moment, the store's sliding doors parted, granting entrance to four lawmen accompanied by their Neural Nomad. It was evident that their purpose was to locate him, their eyes scanning the establishment with focused determination.


[6/19/2023 10:54 PM] Jer
Jer couldn't help but suppress a snicker, his awareness of what inevitably followed such a situation.


[6/19/2023 10:57 PM] Kaedues Staub
*Kaedues turns curiously to the lawmakers, ignoring Aurora's comments. He's curious as to what they're here for.*

*Realistically they're here for him, unless someone else who doesn't belong is hiding inside the store. He waits for them to continue their business.*

One of the officers discreetly nudged his colleague, directing their attention towards Kaedues. With a shared understanding, they closed the distance, their purposeful strides bringing them closer to him. Donning their gloves, a sense of anticipation filled the air. With a stern tone, one of the officers asserted, **"Alright, choom, loitering is strictly prohibited in Cedar Square."**


[6/19/2023 11:11 PM] Kaedues Staub
*Kaedues sighs and walks towards them. He makes a passing glance at Aurora again as he passes her but otherwise seems unphased.*

*As he walks, he looks... perfectly conditioned. Kaedues is definitely NOT the kind of guy a mugger would target, that's for sure. His posture, his speed, the rhythm of his walk all indicate he orders himself strictly.*


[6/19/2023 11:15 PM] Aurora King
With a swift and dismissive wave of her hand, she took charge of the situation, determined to prevent any unnecessary arrests. Her voice carried a hint of impatience as she addressed the officers, her words laced with a touch of snippiness. **"Officers, please pay attention. He's not loitering aimlessly. I specifically hired him to perform essential work for me."** She declared, her tone conveying both authority and annoyance. **"Come back here, I did not release you silly little newbie."**


[6/19/2023 11:15 PM] Narration
The officers halted in their tracks, visibly torn between proceeding with their initial intention and heeding Aurora's words. Their gazes shifted back and forth between each other, as well as Kaedues, their curiosity piqued about his next course of action. It was evident that their focus had shifted, as they became more intrigued by the unfolding situation, waiting to see how Kaedues would respond.


[6/19/2023 11:37 PM] Kaedues Staub
*Kaedues stops walking and turns back toward Aurora curiously.* **"You also didn't pay me. I am not a dog, so if you want my help... we'll have to make if official."** *Kaedues crosses his arms.* **"14 ₥R."**


[6/19/2023 11:51 PM] Aurora King
She was shocked, completely caught off guard. He was supposed to support her alibi and be a __good dog__, but instead, he portrayed her as a fool. The only reason she had the audacity to attempt such a thing was because these officers were familiar with her and knew her boyfriend's association with the CCR. Being ridiculed like this was humiliating, yet she had no choice but to comply with his terms to salvage some dignity. **"14 ₥R."** she muttered under her breath, rolling her eyes and glancing away. At least he was dirt cheap. Charged anymore and she would have told him to fuck himself.


[6/19/2023 11:54 PM] Narration
One of the cops let out a mean-spirited chuckle, quickly joined by the others. A previously tense situation now transformed into a cruel source of amusement. **"Just wait until your boyfriend gets wind of this one, just rich,"** one of the cops taunted with a smirk, reveling in their departure from the store.


[6/20/2023 12:13 AM] Kaedues Staub
*Kaedues promptly leans against the wall.* **"I love working for people like you."** *Kaedues admits with an expression so blank, you can't really tell how he feels.*


[6/20/2023 11:45 AM] Aurora King
She couldn't believe she was being humiliated like this, and the officers' taunts only made it worse. Taking a deep breath to compose herself, she turned to Kaedues, her voice filled with a touch of annoyance. **"Oh, I'm sure you do. Congratulations, you've made your point,"** she said, her tone dripping with sarcasm as she turned her attention towards Jer. **"Later, choom. Gotta shepherd this glitchhead."**


[6/20/2023 11:45 AM] Jer
**"Good luck."** He would say, sighing.


[6/20/2023 11:45 AM] Aurora King
**"Prepped to get started blockhead?"** She would say to 'The Caliber Man' as she walked past him with a quick roll of her eyes.


[6/20/2023 1:02 PM] Kaedues Staub
*Kaedues nods.* **"Let's go."** *As Aurora walks out of the store Kaedues follows closely behind. She might notice that he has a distinct iron-like smell lightly following him around.*


[6/20/2023 1:59 PM] Aurora King
As they stepped out of the store, Aurora scanned the streets, her eyes darting left and right, observing the individuals present and those conspicuously absent. However, amidst her vigilance, her gaze snagged on the group of officers leisurely lounging near their patrol vehicles. Their eyes fixated on Aurora and Kaedues, their attention unmistakable, like predators observing their prey, as they witnessed their departure from the store. she sharply gazed back before heading down the sidewalk. **"Nice job, glitchhead. I'm starting to wonder why I bothered pulling your ass out of a scrape. Instead, you run your yap and make a mess of things. All my effort to lend a hand, and now it feels like I've zero'd a part of myself in this drek."**


[6/20/2023 5:29 PM] Kaedues Staub
**"Good luck with that,"** *Kaedues retorts.* **"I can't help. But now that I'm on payroll I'll fix those pipes of yours. More too, if you have something worth the money."** *He walks parallel with Aurora. He looks around at his surroundings while he walks.*


[6/20/2023 7:21 PM] Aurora King
**"No fucking' way, you chrome-cased chump. You ain't got a slitchin' clue 'bout the stack of troubles you've dumped on my plate. I'm only trudging through this drek 'cause we got eyes all over our asses."** Her voice carried the weight of frustration and distress. **"Naturally someone like __you__  don't got a byte of understanding about how things run here."**


[6/20/2023 10:25 PM] Kaedues Staub
**"...."** *Kaedues pauses for a moment before turning to Aurora and responding.* **"You hired me __knowing__ I'm not from around here."** *He pauses so the implications of his question become obvious.* **"Let's take a look at the pipes you are talking about."** *Kaedues mentions that last bit with a twinge of suspicion. Does he think her pipes are worse than advertised? Is Kaedues being overly cautious? Who knows?*

Kaedues found himself back on the streets of Cedar Square, his steps leading him straight towards the store that held the coveted outfit he had set his sights on. However, he knew that acquiring it would require obtaining a membership, which meant engaging in a conversation with the man stationed behind the counter, Jer.


[6/28/2023 12:27 AM] Kaedues Staub
*Kaedues doesn't mind the thought. He's prepared to perform what the locals call a 'pro gamer move'.*
*The door to the convenience store opens, and Kaedues makes a bee line to the counter.* **"Hello. I'm interested in a store membership. What does that look like here?"**


[6/28/2023 12:32 AM] Jer
**"Well, well, well, look who's back. Can't say I missed your presence, pal. I don't need you causing any more trouble around here. You've already got my friend knee-deep in a whole mess of drek, and now you're planning to drag me into your little slum theatrics. A membership requires your biometric data. Hand on the pad over there."**  He would nudge his head towards the pad to his left.


[6/28/2023 12:32 AM] Kaedues Staub
*Hand on the pad. Kaedues doesn't respond to any of Jer's antics.*


[6/28/2023 12:34 AM] Jer
**"Just great. Now I have to disinfect the pad because of you."** Jer's voice carried a mix of annoyance and resignation, the burden of additional tasks. **"You're all set. If you can even afford anything."**


[6/28/2023 12:35 AM] Kaedues Staub
**"Thanks, Jer."** *He responds simply and then walks over towards the kiosk he is familiar with.*


[6/28/2023 12:40 AM] Jer
**"He fucking stinks..."** He'd grumble.


[6/28/2023 12:48 AM] Kaedues Staub
*Now at the kiosk, Kaedues inspects that fabled red tracksuit he wanted from before. It's not even his style, but it'll make him stand out more and be more recognizable. He inputs his measurements into the system so it can fit the outfit to him. For every space to enter a measurement value Kaedues has an answer. Before long, Kaedues finds that he's almost out of money.... and waiting for a brand new outfit.*


[6/28/2023 12:53 AM] Narration
The machine would spit out a generic purchase response. **"Thank you for your purchase. Your transaction has been completed successfully. We appreciate your business and hope you enjoy your new acquisition. If you have any further inquiries or require assistance, please do not hesitate to contact our customer support. Have a great day!"**

DING! His outfit came out of the box, neatly folded!


[6/28/2023 12:58 AM] Kaedues Staub
*Kaedues takes the outfit and makes a bee line to the store's changing room. In a few moments, Kaedues emerges from said room looking like a normal Fairview citizen... if not for his gait. And his language. And his smell. And the way he talks... you get the point.*

*Anyway, Kaedues casually walks up to the counter again.* **"I gave this store's membership a shot, but it's not for me. I want to cancel."**


[6/28/2023 1:00 AM] Jer
**"Ugh, seems like making people's lives harder is your favorite pastime, huh? Fine, I'll cancel it, but mark my words, don't you ever dare show your face in this place again. We clear?"**Jer's tone carried a mix of frustration and determination, his stance unyielding as he set his conditions for resolution.


[6/28/2023 1:01 AM] Kaedues Staub
**"If you want to play it that way I'm game."** *Kaedues says plainly. In fact, he sounds a little too eager to take Jer up on his offer.*


[6/28/2023 1:05 AM] Jer
He would interface wtih the computer for a few seconds. His eyes darting left and right as he searched the records and removed Kaedues from their system. **"Beat it."**


[6/28/2023 1:08 AM] Kaedues Staub
*Like that, Kaedues walks out of the store with intent never to step back in. Stepping back out onto the streets of Fairview, does he notice anything different?*


[6/28/2023 1:11 AM] Narration
A fresh squad of lawmen sauntered by, completely oblivious to Kaedues' presence, their attention focused elsewhere. The fact that they paid him no mind could be interpreted as a sign of mission success, at least for the time being. The populance too did not mind Kaedues from a distance either. No more weird looks, aside from those gazing upon his unmodified right hand. However, those kind of gazes are to expected.


[6/28/2023 1:13 AM] Kaedues Staub
*In that case, Kaedues makes a beeline to Danny's condo so he can drop off the only thing making him stand out-- the jumpsuit nestled underneath his arm.*

[7/4/2023 1:31 AM] Narration
Another tranquil day unfolded in District 9, Cedar Square. The sun beamed brightly, casting its warm glow on the lively neighborhood. Autonomous vehicles (AVs) glided gracefully above the streets, their unhurried pace radiating an aura of leisure. The residents, too, moved about with a sense of ease – be it on their hoverbikes, the latest model cars, or merely indulging in a bit of retail therapy. Indeed, it was a day of simple pleasures.


[7/4/2023 1:31 AM] Rob Upton
Corporal Mason and Private First Class Rob found themselves stationed in their patrol vehicle, perched on the edge of the bustling sidewalk. Their mission was to monitor the streets designated to them. Rob, seated at the helm of the vehicle, had his seat slightly reclined. His gaze, while seemingly casual, was perpetually trained on the vibrant scene playing out before him.


[7/4/2023 1:35 AM] Rob Upton
Rob and Mason shared a history that extended back to their days at the academy, where they were part of the same graduating class. Their bond could be described as one of friendship or camaraderie, depending on the perspective. Rob had an affinity for the more cerebral pursuits and could be categorized as a nerd. His social interactions with fellow law enforcement officers in their division were limited, and extroversion was not a trait one would associate with him. This made for a complementary partnership, as Mason would step up and assume the social responsibilities of their duo. More often than not, in 9.999993 out of 10 situations. **"Another day in Vespera."** He'd sigh distantly, his attention shifting over towards a family of four walking on the opposite side of the road.


[7/4/2023 1:50 AM] Mason Reed
*Mason was also taking in the neon sights, his arm rested on the door panel. Unlike Rob, Mason wasn't as focused on the scene, it seemed like he had other things on his mind at the moment.* "Yep..." 

*He squinted toward the family of four passing by, causing him to let out a long sigh. His attentiveness on basic lawman duties started to wain a little as the months went by. To the higher ups he maintained composure, but with just him and Rob alone, his demeanor started to yield to his true feelings. Rob probably could guess why.*


[7/4/2023 1:53 AM] Rob Upton
He swiveled towards his partner, his voice tinged with anticipation, **"If my memory serves me right, you've got just two more days before your Leave of Absence kicks in. Must be thrilling, huh?"**


[7/4/2023 1:56 AM] Mason Reed
*Mason removed his arm from the panel and leaned back into his chair, turning toward Rob.* "Of course, though the closer it gets the longer the wait feels."


[7/4/2023 2:01 AM] Rob Upton
**"You're telling me. Though, I'm still finding it hard to believe that you of all people managed to snag an input."** His tone carried a hint of envy, didn't it?


[7/4/2023 2:14 AM] Mason Reed
*Mason raised a brow as he mentioned the term 'input'. Even though that term has been known through most of his life, having it directed at him felt weird still.* "Haha.. I don't blame you, I wonder how I got someone so wonderful as well. And don't worry, I'm sure you'll get someone eventually." *yeah he could sense that tone a mile away.*


[7/4/2023 2:20 AM] Rob Upton
**"You kidding me? There isn't a woman out there who'd even consider engaging with me digitally. There was one girl, but she was not into me like that in grade school. Don't even know where she is now."** He remarked as he slouched further into his chair. Seems like someone's rizz is non-existent. **"I might as well just stick to the BD porn."**


[7/4/2023 2:28 AM] Mason Reed
"..." *Mason turned away, a brief silence entered the car, then he turned back to his partner. His right arm reached over to his shoulder and grabbed it.* "My filter is off-- get your ass out there man..I refuse!! To see you settle." *He then started to pat his shoulder multiple times, each hit added a little more force.*


[7/4/2023 2:32 AM] Rob Upton
Rob was hesitant and clearly out of his comfort zone with the mere thought of “putting himself out there”. His uncertainty was visible, but something in Mason’s words struck a chord within him. His shoulders straightened slightly as he pondered over his partner’s earnest plea. He didn’t respond immediately, but his silence spoke volumes – acknowledging the weight and sincerity of Mason’s encouragement. He sighed before reaching for the radio and turning it on. **"I'll see what I can't do, I guess."**


[7/4/2023 2:39 AM] Mason Reed
*Mason stopped his pats and his eyes widened. There was clear surprise on his face, he didn't expect his encouragement to work that well.* "That's what I like to hear." *He returned to leaning back on his chair, putting his hands behind his head. It did feel a little condescending to Mason, encouraging someone else to get a girlfriend while he already has one, but you won't get anywhere just wishing for something.*


[7/4/2023 2:42 AM] Narration
The radio tuned into something spicy!


[7/4/2023 2:45 AM] Narration
**"In a developing story, Littleton witnessed an action-packed security operation last night as the valiant forces of CCR swiftly responded to an attempted sabotage by an individual alleged to be Paige Underwood, a former member of Horizon Grey. Horizon Grey, a nefarious terrorist organization neutralized by authorities in the wake of their deplorable acts during the Kilo incident in District One years ago, has been believed to be defunct."**

**"The incident was initiated by the CCR's efficient surveillance system, which detected and tracked down Underwood through the streets of Littleton. As CCR agents demonstrated remarkable prowess, an unidentified rogue element emerged from the shadows to aid Underwood. Nonetheless, the CCR’s coordinated and disciplined response forced them to retreat into the underground tunnels of Littleton."**

**"In the interest of public safety and to ensure comprehensive investigations, the CCR has instated a temporary restricted movement policy in Littleton. Residents are encouraged to remain indoors and contribute to the safety of the community by reporting any unusual activity."**

**"The citizens of Littleton have been commendably cooperative, with reports of neighborhood watches and digital community groups forming to provide additional support to the security measures in place."**

**"The citizens of Littleton have been commendably cooperative, with reports of neighborhood watches and digital community groups forming to provide additional support to the security measures in place."**


[7/4/2023 2:45 AM] Rob Upton
As the report went on, Rob's attention went from his own coochie-less lifestyle to the radio. The story drawing him in. **"...?"**


[7/4/2023 2:52 AM] Mason Reed
*The mention of Littleton was all that was needed in order for Mason's full attention to turn to the radio.* "..."


[7/4/2023 2:56 AM] Rob Upton
**"Damn..."** His voice escalated in disbelief, **"Horizon Grey, right here in D9? I was under the impression they all got flatlined in the D1 Kilo debacle... Seriously, man. Hope that crazy bitch and their friend don't find their way here. Things have been too peaceful for that nonsense."**


[7/4/2023 3:04 AM] Mason Reed
*Mason was silent for a while, the news report still fresh in his mind.* "As much as they did, it wouldn't be surprising if they had a few survivors that managed to escape." *He sat up straight in the seat and looked out the window.* "I also agree with you, I'd rather things stayed nice and quiet around here. Though, I feel like I've been hearing news about Littleton more often now."


[7/4/2023 3:06 AM] Rob Upton
**"Yeah, its a shithole like the rest of Haven Heights. I just wish they would go ahead and just blow it all sky high. Be better off without the eyesore."**


[7/5/2023 12:52 AM] Mason Reed
"Hm.. That's going the extreme route, but.." *He paused and started to rub his chin. It seemed like he was in deep thought about something.* "Nah, nevermind, whatever happens to Littleton is up to the top brass."


[7/5/2023 12:41 PM] Rob Upton
Rob glanced over towards Mason for a little while before focusing his attention forward. **"I guess.."**


[7/5/2023 12:41 PM] Narration
First it was the radio and now their MDT would flash coordinates for a call that they have been dispatched to...

[7/5/2023 4:52 PM] Mason Reed
*Mason's thoughts were cut off as the sudden MTD turned on.* "That's us." *He readujsted himself in the seat and turned the car from parked to drive.* "A domestic disturbance at 145 Elm Street.. Well, let's not keep them waiting."


[7/6/2023 12:15 AM] Rob Upton
Rob looked at the screen and exasperated. **"Fuck me."** He would shift his seat forward. The digital mirrors showing that they were clear to pull out into traffic and hauling down the road.


[7/6/2023 12:15 AM] Narration
The call was accepted and the flashing holographic panel on the dash changed from the typical Mobile Data Terminal to a GPS to aid Mason in navigating the streets.


[7/6/2023 12:15 AM] Rob Upton
He would turn on the sirens and would key the radio, allowing Mason to focus on the driving. The logistics is his  **"Car 54 assigned to Incident number... 23-50782. 10-97 to 10-20. Be there in two minutes."**


[7/6/2023 12:26 AM] Narration
The two lawmen, Mason and Rob would pull up in front of the apartment complex in good time. When they were just down the block, Rob killed the siren as to not alert any wrongdoers who would be anticipating their arrival. These calls don't normally and even if they did, not much occurred outside of just mistaken arguments. Though, one could not be too sure. 

Mason parked up along the curb just outside...


[7/6/2023 12:26 AM] Rob Upton
Rob got out of the vehicle, adjusting his belt and fixating his palm against the back of his handgun grip. **"Car 54, 10-23. 10-1 on 100.3."** He would change his frequency dial on his radio to 100.3 with his free hand which was their scene frequency. This granted them access to QRF if things were to go south. Now, he was approaching the front doors.


[7/6/2023 11:47 PM] Mason Reed
*Mason carefully got out of the car after turning it off, also changing the frequency on his dial to 100.3, readying his hand above his belt just in case. He approached the door with Rob, turning to him and gave him a nod, making sure he was ready.*


[7/7/2023 1:06 AM] Narration
The law enforcers crossed the threshold into the apartment complex, their boots purposeful as they made a beeline for the stairwell. 12B - the code deciphered as the 12th room on Floor B, a level up. Opting for agility over comfort, they chose the stairs over the elevator. The atmosphere was cloaked in an unsettling silence, with only the clinking and rustling of their gear punctuating the stillness as they ascended the staircase. The echo in the stairwell seemed to amplify their every move.

Upon reaching the second floor, the anticipated cacophony of a domestic dispute was conspicuously absent. All was still. Rob was the first to step into the hallway, his eyes darting back and forth, scanning for any irregularities. With calculated steps and senses on high alert, he began to inch his way toward room 12.


[7/7/2023 1:06 AM] Rob Upton
**"Dispatch, advise, what's the address of the caller for 50782?"** he inquired into the radio.


[7/7/2023 1:06 AM] Narration
A synthetic, robotic voice responded crisply on both of their radios, **"Caller's location for incident 50782 is registered at room 11B."**


[7/7/2023 1:06 AM] Rob Upton
**"You want to knock on the caller's door while I see if I can't make contact on 12?"**


[7/7/2023 1:18 AM] Mason Reed
"Sure, tell me if you need assistance." *Mason carefully made his way to room 11B, knocking 3 times on the door, waiting for a responce.*


[7/7/2023 1:24 AM] Narration
After Mason's knock, there was a rustle from behind the door before it slowly began to open. The occupant of the apartment exuded a timid aura, her movements cautious as she inched the door open. Before any part of her body was visible, her head cautiously peeked out. Her eyes, wide with apprehension, locked with Mason’s. It was as though she was gripped by the fear that the neighbor she had reported might have caught wind of her actions. **". . ."**


[7/7/2023 1:27 AM] Rob Upton
Rob, assuming a poised stance, positioned himself squarely before room 12, which was situated right adjacent to the door Mason was at. His sharp gaze meticulously swept over the door, taking in its texture, the gleam of the metal numbers affixed to it. There was a focused determination in his movements as he raised his hand and rapped firmly against the door with a steady rhythm. The air seemed to thicken with anticipation as the echo of his knocks resonated down the hallway. 

After delivering his knocks, Rob deftly sidestepped to position himself beside the door, ready to react at a moment’s notice. He did this as a precaution, anticipating the possibility of the door being flung open aggressively or, in a worst-case scenario, facing a more threatening response. Waiting for any sign of movement from within the room.


[7/7/2023 1:36 AM] Mason Reed
*As the caller opened the door and locked eyes with Mason, he began to relax his posture, trying to come off as less threating to the frightened woman. He glanced to the side for a split second when his partner knocked on room 12's door, then returned his gaze back to the callers.* 

*He leaned down a little and spoke in a soft tone.* "We're the CCR responding to your call. You reported hearing loud shouting and objects being thrown around?"


[7/7/2023 1:43 AM] Narration
The woman nudged the door open slightly more, enough to allow her to dart a worried glance down the hallway towards her neighbor's door. Her voice was hushed and her words rushed, an apparent attempt to convey her urgent concern without being overheard.

**"I heard an awful lot of noise from the room next door,"** she began, her voice trembling slightly. **"There's a couple living there. The man, he just lost his job at some big pharma corporation. Since then, he's been drowning his sorrows, day in, day out. I think... I think he might be hurting his girlfriend."**

Her eyes darted anxiously toward the other door again. **"Not long ago, there were these loud bangs, screams... Terrifying and then quiet. That's when I decided to call."** Her last sentence was nearly a whisper, filled with a blend of fear and determination.

She leaned in a little closer to Officer Mason, her eyes wide. **"And there’s something else,"** she added, her voice dropping to an even lower whisper. **"I think he might be on something. I’ve seen him before, and this is different. His shouting’s more erratic, and I swear it’s like he’s lost all control."** she finished, her eyes welling up with genuine concern.


[7/7/2023 1:48 AM] Rob Upton
Rob maintained his position near room 12, his senses heightened as he absorbed the woman's account relayed by Mason. The ominous silence from behind the door suddenly seemed more menacing. With a newfound sense of urgency, Rob smoothly unholstered his handgun and held it in a low-ready position. His voice, steady yet laced with the weight of the situation, broke the silence as he spoke into his radio. **"Dispatch, requesting QRF. Have them step it up. We might have an escalation scenario in progress. One male suspect, potential female victim inside the apartment."** His eyes never left the door, but he shot a quick, determined glance toward Mason, nudging him to come to him. They'll have to deal with the situation themselves for the time being.


[7/7/2023 1:58 AM] Mason Reed
*He nodded and turned back to the woman.* "We'll take care of the situation, stay in your room until further notice." *He then quickly, but carefully over to Rob standing on the opposite side he was. Mason took out his handgun, his senses heightened, and body tensed, preparing for whatever was on the other side of that door. If the man is still on something, he probably won't care about who gets in his way, Mason was taking no chances here.*


[7/7/2023 2:05 AM] Rob Upton
The doors in this building were modernized, featuring sleek keypads in lieu of traditional knobs. For the CCR, this was a boon. Their issued wrist gear contained RFID biometric scanners, granting them universal access for emergencies. Rob raised his wrist close to the pad, and the built-in scanner briefly illuminated before the door silently slid open. He took a deep breath, his gun at the ready as he peered into the room.


[7/7/2023 2:05 AM] Narration
As the door slid open, a shroud of darkness enveloped the apartment, as if it was reluctant to relinquish its secrets. The hallway stretching before Rob and Mason was narrow with every light within the room being turned off.

There were two doors on either side of the hallway; they were closed, with no signs or sounds coming from behind them. The doors had seen better days - their once glossy finish marred by scuffs and scratches and holes, each telling an untold story.


[7/7/2023 2:05 AM] Rob Upton
**"CCR! Come out with your hands up!"** Rob’s voice boomed through the darkness, authoritative and unwavering, resonating against the walls as if trying to penetrate the shadows themselves. **"Mason, get your light down the hallway."** Rob knew charging into the room was a no-no. Best to identify where anyone was before going in.


[7/7/2023 2:31 AM] Mason Reed
*Mason turned on the light on his handgun, slowly moving the light throughout the room.* "Cover me.." *Mason began to walk up a bit, moving the light to different parts of the room. As the light pierced through the shadows, Mason carefully pushed forward taking one step at a time.*


[7/8/2023 12:39 AM] Narration
Beyond the doorway's edge, Mason's tactical flashlight cut through the room's murky veil, revealing an unsettling tableau of carnage and chaos. The harsh light danced over a splatter of blood, its crimson hues smeared grotesquely across the walls. The hallway, a narrow, dimly-lit stretch, unfurled into what seemed to be the living room. Yet, just before the demarcation line, he could see the hunched figure of a man, his gaze focused downwards, seemingly engrossed in something out of Mason's line of sight. A heartbeat later, the man swiveled towards Mason, his visage illuminated by the unforgiving light.


[7/8/2023 12:43 AM] Narration
The suspect was blinking blearily into the harsh beam of Mason's flashlight, the man squinted, his face a tangle of confusion along with an unhinged laugh erupted from his mouth, raspy and hollow. **"What's the prob... the...issue?"** he slurred, gus voice a sickening coctail of deranged humor and dangerous unpredictablity. The man swayed on his feet, the intoxicating influence of whatever narcotics he'd consumed making him unpredictable.


[7/13/2023 1:31 AM] Mason Reed
*Mason squinted toward the drunken man, his hands gripped the handgun even tighter, preparing to make a move any given second. He clearly seemed like someone with nothing else to lose, if Mason thinks what that blood stain on the wall is, then...* 

"..Are you fucking kidding me..." *He said under his breath a hint of anger being heard in it. He slightly moved backwards, keeping the light directed on the face of the man.* "This is the CCR! We've received reports of loud disturbances coming from this room. Put your hands behind your back please..before this gets ugly."

*Mason himself knew that his warning most likely fell on deaf ears with him being intoxicated and all.*


[7/18/2023 3:04 PM] Narration
Narrator: The man lurched unsteadily, a marionette jangled by unseen hands. His eyes, ordinarily a crisp winter white, were now veiled by a nebulous purple fog, a toxic atmosphere revealing the circuitry of red vessels painted in tangled streaks. Like a ship tossed in a tempest, he swayed precariously, gravity gaining the upper hand as his weight staggered in betrayal towards the innocent bystander – a petite table unsuspectingly nestled in his precarious path.

A sudden collision ensued, the wooden entity clattering in an echoed protest, its usual equilibrium disrupted by the intoxicated individual. The man's world spun as the floor became the ceiling and the legs of the furniture turned into insurmountable obstacles. In an unpredictable dance between the puppet and his wooden adversary, he stumbled, his foot entwined in the angular limbs of the overturned table, leading to an ungraceful descent, a tumble that mirrored his intoxicated world.

With a half-grin wrestling against his grimace of discomfort, the man let out a raspy chuckle. He raised a shaky finger to the innocent piece of furiniture. **"Well, table,  it appears we're both leg....legless tonight..  HA!!!!!"**


[7/18/2023 3:08 PM] Rob Upton
Rob maintained a steady grip on his handgun, its cool muzzle pointed unerringly towards the stumbling figure. Though he was reasonably certain the disoriented man posed no immediate danger, it was not his call to make. His gaze briefly swiveled to Mason, a silent question hanging in the air between them before snapping back to the unpredictable spectacle before him.


[7/21/2023 12:30 AM] Mason Reed
*Mason's gaze turned toward Rob for a split second, contemplating what to do with the druken man. He certainly didn't seem like he could make any calculated moves. Mason sighed and lowered his gun a tad, making sure to keep the light on him.* "...Well, let's get him out of here. Once he's out of the room we'll be able to conduct a thorough investigation."

*He took a few glances around the room and began walking closer to the man. Something was bugging Mason, almost like his senses were telling him __something__ else had to be here...* `"Where is the woman.."` *That question was echoing in the back of his mind. There was no sign of the woman besides that one bloodstain, and that only made him fear what the answer to that question was.*


[7/28/2023 11:17 AM] Rob Upton
"Alright, I will lock him down." As they closed in, he holstered his weapon, unveiling a gadget that resembled a slim rod with dual openings. Upon contact with the perp's wrist, it birthed a luminous holographic bind, bathing his arm in an ethereal blue-green light, leaving it incapacitated. The same sequence played out on the other hand, with both limbs now cuffed and contained at the man's back.


[7/28/2023 11:23 AM] Narration
Mason entered in the primary room where the intoxicated man was embroiled in a futile contest with a minuscule table. The room clearly functioned as the main living space, punctuated by a holographic TV screen adorning the wall to his right. Flanking the spectral display to the left, a corridor snaked its way deeper into what were presumably bedrooms. The gleaming hard floors underfoot bore the stains of blood, its trail originating from a spot on the wall, winding its way into the hallway.


[7/31/2023 1:24 PM] Mason Reed
*Mason Took glances around the living space, making sure to keep an eye out for anything that could be unusual. But, the main thing that got his attention was the bloodstain leading toward the hallway. Deciding that was the most important clue, he began to walk down the hallway, following the blood trail.*


[8/23/2023 10:16 PM] Narration
The blood trail ominously snaked its way from the hallway, leading to a door closed. Behind it, the glow of light beckoned. Was it a bathroom? Or perhaps a bedroom?


[8/26/2023 12:34 AM] Mason Reed
*Mason carefully continued down the hallway, once he made a decent way down, he noticed the blood trail led to a closed door. With the light on he didn’t know what to expect, everything else was dark besides this one room..*

*Once he steps in front of the door he grabs the knob with his left hand, his right hand still tightly gripped around his handgun. Slowly, he pushes the door open, waiting for whatever to reveal itself.*


[8/26/2023 1:10 AM] Narration
The door yielded under the gentle pressure of Mason's hand. As it swung open with a silent creak, the expanse of the room beyond unfurled before him. It was unmistakably a bathroom, illuminated in the soft, diffused light filtering through a frosted window. To his immediate left was a porcelain toilet, pristine and white. Further in, he glimpsed the contours of an old-fashioned clawfoot bathtub, partly obscured by a lacy shower curtain.

But what truly caught his attention was the lone figure by the sink. The whispered tales of the neighbors painted a picture in his mind, but seeing her now was a stark contrast to imagination.

She was a picture of resilience and tragedy. Pale skin marred by purpling bruises, some fresh and others in the process of healing. A gash on her forehead bled slowly, staining her disheveled hair. Her eyes, though, were the most striking — a vivid green, sharply contrasting her battered state. They were wide with surprise but showcased a clarity that spoke of her alertness.

Positioned at the sink's counter, she tried to staunch the bleeding, dabbing at her wounds with shaking hands. The array of first-aid items scattered haphazardly around her suggested a desperate attempt to make sense of the violence that had been inflicted upon her. She looked at Mason, and for a moment, time seemed to stand still.... Her eyes met Mason's, and a flash of recognition crossed her face. The uniform, the badge — they marked him as a figure of authority, perhaps even safety. 

Swallowing hard, her voice quivering but determined, she finally spoke, meeting Mason's gaze twisted with fear. **"Officer... please. It's not what it looks like. I... I fell. It was just an accident. He didn’t mean to..."**


[8/28/2023 11:28 PM] Mason Reed
*Once Mason opened the door, his gaze first went left, just a regular toilet, but then it turned right.* “…!!” *What he saw betrayed his imagination to the highest degree. Her bruises, eyes, face, everything made Mason sick to his stomach.*

*His eyes fell down to the array of medical items then back up to the woman. His neutral and cautious expression turned into one of empathy and sadness. He placed his gun into its holster and took a few more glances around her wounds.*

“It.. It’s ok, I think you’ve suffered quite enough.” *Mason made his way over to her, bandaging the spots that looked the most bruised and lethal.* “I can’t believe this…” *He mumbled under his breath.*


[9/21/2024 10:13 PM] Narration
The woman resigned herself to Mason. A wave of humiliation followed, along with defeat. One could imagine how she ended up in this position, feeling both vulnerable and powerless. It was only a matter of time before her husband was bailed out. 

Occasionally, she muttered to herself, perhaps cursing her husband for her exposedness. Nonetheless, Mason assisted the victim with her immediate injuries. Fortunately, they weren't too severe and she still had full range of motion. As Mason finished up, his partner emerged from the doorway. It was time for Mason to finish what he was doing so he may have a word with his counterpart.


[9/21/2024 10:48 PM] Mason Reed
*It was obvious that Mason felt extremely bad for her, the man..not so much. He couldn't comprehend why a person that supposedly loves you, would put their spouse in a state such as this. As soon he finished treating her he stood up.* "I'm sorry this happened..." *That's all he could really say, for a situation like this.*

*He then turned to his partner and walked up to him, letting out a sigh.* "She's been cared for, how's the guy?"


[9/21/2024 10:52 PM] Rob Upton
Rob sighed, crossing his arms and stepping away from the doorway so they may speak of the matter not in front of the victim. **"He's in custody and sitting in Car 30's cruiser. They decided it was best to incapacitate him since the moment we started putting him in the car, he started acting erratically." ** After his brief explanation, he would gaze back at the bathroom door. **"What about her?"**


[9/21/2024 11:07 PM] Mason Reed
"When I walked in she was trying to clean up her bruises. Even tried to defend the guy by saying it was a fall, or he didn't mean do it." *He shook his head.* "She's most likely been conditioned to his treatment and endured this for so long just to stay with him. Though, the reason why..not sure."


[9/22/2024 12:05 AM] Rob Upton
Rob contorted the corner of his mouth momentarily before looking back at Mason. **"Had Dylan do a quick search on the nut-job. Repeated offender, and always on something. We both know what is going to happen next, he's going to get post on bail and he'll be back before the night's over."** Rob began looking around the house. **"Unless we find a big score of narcotics. Since we know he is on something."** He paused for a moment before suggesting in a hushed tone. **"We could always plant some... You know. Evidence."** Rob then looked back at the bathroom to ensure the victim wasn't listening. **"It's either let him come home tonight or lock him up for good."**


[9/22/2024 2:38 AM] Mason Reed
"......" *There was a good pause before Mason said anything. Either get rid of the problem or let it continue. Well, each decision ultimately had some sort of unknown underline to it. But, they're police officers aren't they? Why would they sabotage a civilian...* "That's some question, Rob. Honestly, I'd..." *Mason looked back at the bathroom.*

"Is it alright if I speak to her real quick. There's somethings I want to know first."


[9/22/2024 2:40 AM] Rob Upton
**"I'll let Dylan know we are still investigating."** He'd reply, moving towards the front door.


[9/22/2024 2:42 AM] Mason Reed
"Thanks." *Mason moved back into the bathroom.* "Excuse me, there's a few things we want to ask."


[9/22/2024 2:58 AM] Narration
The woman was sitting on the edge of the tub by the time Mason returned, her gaze was distant and muted. His words snapped her out of her trance as she shook her head. **"I'm...sorry.. I can try and help... I don't know what I could do for you though..."**


[9/22/2024 3:08 AM] Mason Reed
"It's ok, all you have to do is answer a few questions." *Mason spoke in a soft tone, trying to ease some of her stress.* "First, do you remember how long this has been going on for?"


[9/23/2024 12:21 AM] Narration
The woman smiled faintly. Whatever expression she made wasn't reaching her eyes. **"Oh.. No, not particularly..
 He gets like this rarely.. Work stresses him out..."**

Details outside of the question were provided. Mason probably detects that she's padding the answer for a specific outcome.


[9/25/2024 11:47 PM] Mason Reed
*Mason internally sighed and took a second to respond.* "...I'm sorry, but I'm looking for the straight answer. We've already heard that this was a frequently recurring event, and that he's recently lost his job."

*He dropped his formal tone and went into his casual one.* "You don't have to worry about getting abused anymore. Is there some specific reason why you're defending him this much?"


[9/27/2024 3:35 PM] Narration
Mason's words only furthered distressed the woman. **"He's my husband, what kind of wife would I be if I didn't defend him! And I'm not being abused, We were just arguing and it just got out of hand. There is nothing more to this officer."**


[9/27/2024 11:35 PM] Mason Reed
*Masons eye's widened at her response. Mainly because that was the sort of answer he was looking for.* "I understand that you're trying to protect him, and I respect that. But there's a point where a person's actions cross the line from being understandable to unacceptable, and this incident clearly crosses that line. The fact that he's your husband only shows how unusual and concerning his treatment is."

*He paused briefly, choosing his words carefully to avoid making things worse.* "I know this is a difficult situation, and I can see how overwhelming it must feel. But right now, we're just trying to find the best outcome for both of you. It's obvious you still have an attachment to him, be that from your time with him or dislike for change. Though, would you really want to keep things how they are?"


[9/28/2024 6:48 PM] Narration
The woman eased up physically. The wrinkles in her brow vanished as she placed her face into her hands. Taking a few shaking breaths in a bid to soothe her nerves. **"There are no good outcomes."** She muttered underneath her palms.  **"Not with my husband's job taken from him. I have nowhere to go. If he goes away, then we are going to lose the apartment. I cannot keep up with the cost of living... We'll be homeless...Or worse, be forced into Haven Heights."** She confessed, her hands lowering just enough for her to see over the finger tips. Staring at the wall, imagining the horrible things that would befall her.


[10/12/2024 6:46 PM] Mason Reed
"......" *He couldn't speak. Or, he couldn't think of anything to say to that. Multiple suggestions popped into his head, but none of them could guarante her safety or another opportunity for her husband. For a second Mason looked a little lifeless, he truly did not know what he could do for her. And if he could do anything, would it be good enough?*

"...I'm sorry, I need to leave for a second." *Mason turned around and started to make his way to the door.*


[10/12/2024 8:08 PM] Narration
The woman watched the officer go. Her mind started to wander, about what was to come. Imagining herself in a cold cell in the streets of Haven Heights. She'd hear stories of what happens to those in the city slums. How the gangs would go around and prey upon the vulnerable... How people are treated worse than livestock. Her heart sank and her mind fell deeper into a void. Tears began to swell in the corner of her eyes. No, she wasn't going to allow herself to get dragged down there. Even if it means...

She shot to her feet and bolted for Mason, tripping and nearly falling in the process. The amount of distance she covered would only allow Mason to turn around partially. With desperation, the wife wrapped her hands around the officers holstered pistol. **"Nngh!!"** Her resolved proved to be enough for the weapon to come free and with a single goal in mind, she turned the weapon onto herself. Pressing the tip of the gun to the side of her temple and pulled the trigger.
A loud crack of the firearm discharging rang through the room, the flash of light and heat burned her neck before she crumpled onto the floor.


[10/13/2024 4:52 PM] Mason Reed
"**WAI-!***" *Once she grabbed the gun in his holster he tried to stop her, but once he fully turned around she had already pulled the trigger. He could only watch her body fall to the ground and blood pile up on the floor were her body laid. What was initial shock turned into an almost scary calm, though it would be better to call it silent rage.*

"...I see..." *He closed his eyes and took a few deep breaths, like he was preparing himself for something or coming to terms with something he had to do. She was already dead, and the gun shot probably alerted some people around the area, so that wasn't good. The worst case scenario already came to pass, so...* "I'm so sorry..." *He said with a sincere tone as he approached her body and stopped to retrieve his gun. After that, he was going to move her body off the floor and into a more respectable position, but he ultimately chose to leave it in its current state.*

*A look of frustration crossed his face as he gave the room and her lifeless body one more look. He left the room and made his way down to where the other suspect was being held.*


[10/13/2024 8:43 PM] Narration
Mason had left the apartment building. As soon as the automatic doors opened to the outside world, Rob could be seen, hurrying to the door himself. Must've heard the shot earlier and and decided to investigate. Once he laid eyes on Mason, he would ease up a bit as he holstered his service pistol.


[10/13/2024 8:43 PM] Rob Upton
**"There you are. Heard a gunshot. You alright?"** He asked as he shifted his frames back onto his face.


[10/13/2024 10:37 PM] Mason Reed
*Once Mason came into view it was obvious he wasn't the same person that walked in with Rob just by his expression and demeanor alone. It was almost like a switch had flipped within him mentally. He slightly shook his head and started to walk past him and toward the car with the drunk man.*

*He knocked on the drivers window and signaled for them to roll down the back window and unlock the doors.*


[10/13/2024 10:40 PM] Narration
The officer complied with the order, the window was rolled down and the door's lock was disengaged.


[10/13/2024 10:44 PM] Mason Reed
*Once the window was rolled down Mason moved to the back window to get a view of the man.* "Hey, you still breathing?"


[10/13/2024 10:52 PM] Narration
The drunkard looked over to the other officer and smiled with a toothy grin. **"I am not a bad person. I didn't do anything wrong."** He spoke, words slurred and his tone unsteady. **"Can I just...take a nap?"** The drunk man questioned.


[10/13/2024 10:53 PM] Rob Upton
Rob himself was a few meters from Mason, hands pocketed as he scoped out their surroundings.


[10/13/2024 10:59 PM] Mason Reed
"Hm... Sure, you can take a nap." *Mason moved back from the door and opened it, pulling the man out of the car.*


[10/13/2024 11:01 PM] Narration
**"Thank you."** He muttered as he stumbled forward. Only to have his body fall onto the ground as his feet gave way. **"Woah hoho! Down we go!"** He'd squeal with drunken glee. Rolling over to his side to stare up at Mason. **"You're pretty cool."** He complimented, his eyes unable to focus on anything. **"Are we going now? My wife and I got some unfinished business."**


[10/13/2024 11:04 PM] Rob Upton
Rob looked over his partner from the corner of his eye, the way he was behaving and his body language. Something went south, but he wasn't going to say a thing about it. Instead, he was going to watch his partners next move.


[10/13/2024 11:09 PM] Mason Reed (pinned)
"Yep, I'll send you right to her..." *Mason pulled out his gun from his holster and pointed it square at the man's head. At first he hesitated to go through with this, but after seeing the mans unremorseful attitude, he really couldn't care any less for him.*

"Night." *He pulled the trigger and shot him in the middle of his head.*

[10/13/2024 11:15 PM] Rob Upton
**"..."** Rob didn't flinch or even move a single muscle. He simply stood and observed. His eyes never left the man's corpse, even after Mason fired the gun. **"...He deserved it..."** He spoke flatly. **"...The woman's dead?"** Rob asked, pushing his frames back onto the ridge of his nose. The concussion caused the frames to slide.


[10/13/2024 11:21 PM] Mason Reed
*Once the deed was done, he put away his gun and turned away from the body toward Rob.* "...Yeah, took my gun and shot herself. The last response she gave me..I don't think I've seen someone that down in despair in a while."


[10/13/2024 11:25 PM] Rob Upton
Rob nodded solemnly, **"I'll ask Car 30 handle the clean-up. Meet you back in the squad cruiser."**


[10/13/2024 11:40 PM] Mason Reed
*Mason nodded and turned back to the dead body laying on the ground. Well, he doesn't really feel bad for the man particularly. Overall it would've been better if none of this happened in the first place and both could live happy lives. Sadly, that choice has past. All he could do was pray that both got to rest in a place they both deserved to go.*

*Since there was nothing else to do regarding this case, he still needed to speak to Dylan though. He closed the cars door and made his way over to his squad cruiser.*


[12/8/2024 8:24 PM] Narration
The interior was dark. A soft hue of red, blue, and white was cast over the interior from the squad cruiser's lights outside. A gentle hum of electronics filled the space, soft beeps could be heard from the onboard computer. The sound of the door opening broke the silence, followed by the sound of the notification that the vehicle was still running.

CCR operators had the ability to either conference call the dispatcher or communicate over the radio and or cybernetics. It was up to Mason how he wished to get a hold of her.


[12/12/2024 11:39 AM] Mason Reed
*Once Mason got into the car, he leaned his head back against the chair, taking a moment to clear his head. He eyed the computer, contemplating whether to call the dispatcher over a conference call, or by cybernetics. Considering how he felt at the moment, he'd rather go for a more personal approach. So, he decided to call over cybernetics, waiting for them to pick up.*


[12/12/2024 11:02 PM] Narration
The call was being transmitted, awaiting for a response. It rang for quite some time which Mason would know meant that she was either in a meeting or working out another call that had been handed off to her to moderate. When it seemed that the call would drop, Dylan picked up!


[12/12/2024 11:04 PM] Dylan Hackett
**"Mason, sorry I almost missed your call; Just cleared out a call a moment ago... What you got for me?"** Dylan inquired, seemingly eager to work with Mason.


[12/12/2024 11:40 PM] Mason Reed
*The long wait almost made Mason cut the call off prematurely, but at that moment she answered!* "Oh, you had me worried there for a sec..."

"Just letting you know that we took care of the call. Though, it didn't exactly end as pretty as I'd hoped it did..." *It was obvious that the tone of his voice indicated that **something** had happened. He sounded more...drained than his usual call reports.*


[12/13/2024 1:42 PM] Dylan Hackett
There was a momentary pause, **"I know how you feel."** Another pause.

**"Do you need me to pull you off of patrol?"**


[12/14/2024 1:10 AM] Mason Reed
"Nah, I'll be fine." *He tried to raise his mood.* "Just feels kinda ironic, considering that **this** was one of my last calls... Other than that, how's everything on your end been? Any notable trouble?"


[12/14/2024 1:19 AM] Dylan Hackett
**"Unfortunately, there is an high-risk warrant that has been issued issued moments ago, and they are planning for a raid on their two hideouts tonight. It has been relatively quiet until an hour ago..."** She exasperated.


[12/14/2024 1:21 AM] Dylan Hackett឵
**"I am going to have to allocate a few lawmen to help the Haven Heights special tactics unit. Considering we believe our target is still there... But since the report I have received from Rob and the other units on your scene is quite concerning... I will defer the assignment to another team."**


[12/14/2024 2:25 AM] Mason Reed
"Hmm..." *There was a slightly long pause on Mason's side. A part of him wanted to just accept the dispatch, but he also has no idea what would be in store for him if he went to the raid or how his partner would feel about it.*

*He sighed and leaned forward in his chair.* "...If possible could you leave the dispatch for us open for a while?  Personally, I wouldn't really mind taking the spot if I could help out, but I would like Rob's input on it."


[12/14/2024 2:46 AM] Dylan Hackett
**"You're willing to go to Haven Heights?"** She sounded shock. __*NO ONE*__ in their right mind would never volunteer. Then again, it was Mason.


[12/14/2024 3:33 AM] Mason Reed
*He chuckled a little.* “Insane, right? I know, that’s why I’m waiting on Rob, he’d have more sense for this than I would. I’m only following a habit I’ve had since I was a kid.”


[12/14/2024 3:42 AM] Dylan Hackett
**"I don't know what to think of that, truthfully... After you clear off that site, return to the station. If the two of you decide you want to go, then I will have all the details by then. Right now, I have my hands tied since this isn't a call I managed."**

every post you make is one post closer to mason's inevitable prosperous relationship with aurora king! each word represents a commandment of their matrimony, each punctual glyph representing the hard work and dedication it takes to get there! each iconic unforgettable one-liner represents the total of 14.62 children they will produce in their lifetime! isn't that wonderful?

[12/14/2024 11:27 PM] Mason Reed
"Gotcha. Thanks for all your work Dylan, and sorry for taking up your time." *After saying that Mason hung up the call. His immediate thoughts after questioned if accepting this was a good idea after all... He just shrugged it off and turned his attention to the window to see what the other officers was doing, and more specifically where Rob was.*


[12/14/2024 11:38 PM] Rob Upton
Seconds later, Rob opened the passenger door and climbed into the patrol vehicle with an exasperated sigh, taking off his glasses and rubbing the bridge of his nose to alleviate the tension from scrunching his brow too often. **"The other units are clearing off the call. Coroner was called to clean up those bodies."** With a extended silence, he then refixed his glasses onto his nose and looked over to Mason. **"Back to the station?"**


[12/14/2024 11:57 PM] Mason Reed
*...Huh...* "......" *After seeing Rob's mannerisms he could almost guarantee he wouldn't be happy with what Mason had to tell him. He already looked so tired.* "Mm.. Possibly? I just called Dylan and she informed me on a high-risk warrant in Haven Heights. Apparently they need some lawmen to help out."

Rob pressed his lips thinly, contemplating the information. **"Who the hell does command want out of Haven Heights?"** He asked to himself as he out the front windshield. **"You're looking to accept it, aren't you?"**


[12/15/2024 6:04 PM] Mason Reed
*Mason tilted his head a bit before slightly nodding.* "When she asked I said I didn't mind. Though, I told tell her it wasn't 100 percent decided until I asked you."


[12/15/2024 6:22 PM] Rob Upton
Rob grumbled to himself, clearly agitated with what his conscious was telling him to do. One last look towards Mason sealed the deal for him and ultimately folded to the idea. **"I'm short on hours. Might as well."**

*Mason smirked and reached over to give Rob a firm pat on the back.* "See, this is why you're the best partner I could have... Wait- why are you short on hours..?" *While starting the car and putting it into gear, Mason texted Dylan on his cybernetics to let her know that they would accept the dispatch before they arrived at the station, just in case.*


[12/15/2024 7:34 PM] Rob Upton
**"I didn't really mean I was short on hours, I just need more. Since our tour is about to elapse. It would be nice to take some extra micros home. We won't be on duty for a while."**


[12/15/2024 8:35 PM] Mason Reed
"Yeah, I get that. Guess we're ending our time with a bang, and hopefully a nice paycheck." *Mason began to drive off the site, headed toward the station.*


[12/15/2024 8:51 PM] Narration
Mason and Rob returned to the station, parked in the enforcer fleet vehicle parking area. The lot was quiet, with only traffic hum breaking the silence. Rows of patrol cars stood still under the dim glow of the setting sun, their polished surfaces reflecting the orange glow. A gentle breeze rustled the nearby trees, adding to the evening's tranquil atmosphere. Only a few other lawmen were in the lot, doing an assortment of tasks.


[12/15/2024 8:51 PM] Rob Upton
Rob hopped out the Ion Enforcer and moved to collect his duffle bag from the back seat. **"What are you planning on doing during our leave?"** He asked, making idle chatter with Mason.


[12/15/2024 9:51 PM] Mason Reed
*Mason got out the car and also retrieved his belongings.* "Nothing to big. I might actually try to fully relax this time instead of partially thinking about work. It's also been a while since I've done an outing..." *Once Mason got home he knew what he would be doing―*

"How about you?"

**"Going to take my mom out to Neon Kyrie for a week and visit family."** He replied as he hoisted the back onto his shoulder and made his way towards the station. **"Haven't been to Kyrie since graduation."**


[12/15/2024 10:15 PM] Mason Reed
"Oh? Hope everything goes well with that. I'd actually enjoy seeing you get a win." *That probably sounded smug, but he was very sincere.*


[12/15/2024 10:32 PM] Rob Upton
**"Ha.. Ha."** Rob certainly took that as a smug comment, but it was in good spirit. There weren't many instances that would get Rob worked up.


[12/15/2024 10:32 PM] Narration
The duo entered the station and were greeted with a flurry of activity within the station. Lawmen hurried back and forth, answering phones and processing docs, while ringing phones and chatter filled the air. A few people sat anxiously on benches, waiting for their turn to speak with an Lawman.

**"You think Dylan is in the dispatch center?"** He asked Mason as they entered the locker room.


[12/15/2024 11:49 PM] Mason Reed
"Should be..." *Mason proceeded to his locker and unlocked it In it was pictures of several people that briefly caught his eye on the side. However, he immediately jolted out of his trance, put away his belongings, and took what he needed from the locker.* "...She told us to meet up with her if we accepted the dispatch, so I'd expect her to be there."


[12/16/2024 12:01 AM] Rob Upton
**"I'm getting cold feet."** He muttered to himself. Staring at the back of his locker.


[12/16/2024 12:17 AM] Mason Reed
"..." *Mason closed his locker and walked over to Rob, giving him a pat on the shoulder.* "...I get how you feel, but we're almost done. Last big one of the season, then we can finally get some rest. Yeah?"


[12/16/2024 12:24 AM] Rob Upton
He shook his head, **"Yeah... I guess. Come on, lets go find Dylan.."** Something about Rob's response and gesture eluded that it wasn't the shift that was dampening his mood.


[12/16/2024 12:36 AM] Mason Reed
*Mason raised a brow.* "Alright..."  *That response felt very..half-assed? If it wasn't the mission that was making him act this way then he wasn't sure what was. Maybe something or someone he mentioned? All Mason could do was watch over him until they were done with their shifts. With that in the back of his mind, Mason made his way over to the dispatch center in hopes Dylan was there.*


[12/16/2024 12:49 AM] Narration
It was only a few turns to the dispatch center. Once the two entered the room, Mason spotted Dylan.


[12/16/2024 12:49 AM] Dylan Hackett
Dylan was standing off to one side of the room, multiple holographic displays orbiting the young woman as her eyes danced between them. Mason and Rob were off to her right, just enough where she wouldn't notice them.


[12/16/2024 12:50 AM] Rob Upton
Rob moved a bit slower than Mason. He'd much rather be in the background for this.


[12/16/2024 1:17 AM] Mason Reed
"Oh..." *Mason said under his breath.* `"I...I think I see what was bothering him."` *Mason had a small smirk and slightly shook his head. Rob was more introverted than him, maybe even more so with girls? Mason quickly fixed his look as he walked up closer up to Dylan to get her attention.*

"Hey, we're here for your call."


[12/16/2024 5:10 AM] Dylan Hackett
Dylan was in her element until Mason's voice pierced through her focus. Her eyes flicked into his direction and with a subtle turn of her head, she was now able to regard Mason. 

**"Hey Mason thanks for coming. I know it's your last day and I feel terrible for asking so much of you."** She went to explain. The holographic screens began to flicker out of existence until it was just her, Mason and Rob.


[12/17/2024 5:25 PM] Mason Reed
"It's no big deal, you do quite a lot for us yourself so don't worry about it." *The flickering lights of the holograms caught masons attention for a while, that is until they disapeared.* "So, you have the details on the dispatch for us?"

**"Most, still ironing out the logistics with command."**


[12/17/2024 7:23 PM] Narration
Immediately information began to be fed to Mason and Rob through their neural sockets.


[12/17/2024 7:23 PM] Dylan Hackett
**"We received numerous tips from our detective sub-division about two hideouts that a man in connection to a dangerous criminal were located. Normally, with these kind of calls Spec Ops would have it handled. But, for some reason or another our available teams have been reduced by 80%."** There was a pause, even she was trying to come to reason as to why their manpower has been reduced. **"Long story short, we are low on manpower and I have been given the duty of filling empty rolls in Haven Heights."**


[12/17/2024 7:23 PM] Narration
A exterior top-down shot of https://discord.com/channels/1106367747727835206/1110246035382620272/1110246050880573632 was displayed to Mason and Rob.


[12/17/2024 7:23 PM] Dylan Hackett
**"The person of interest is Cole Mercer. Age; 28. Formerly a bounty hunter with the usercode 182906 was found assisting a multi-district terrorist by the name of Paige Underwood. Though, I was informed to __inform you__ that our superiors do __*not*__ want the name Paige to get out. Discretion is important. You'll be meeting up Lt. Hilton and one other. Hopefully, by the time you zero in at the meeting location I would have finalized things with the Lieutenant."**


[12/17/2024 9:10 PM] Mason Reed
*As the hideout was displayed infront of Mason he'd make note of it's appearance. Honestly, looked like a normal hideout for well, a gang or something similar, desolate and all.. He'd also make note of everything else she said, Paige Underwood, and even the 80% reduction in manpower, which even had Mason confused.* 

"...A former bounty hunter, huh. I guess someone like that would be expected in this situation. What about this Paige Underwood? Am I allowed to ask about specifics for her?"


[12/17/2024 10:28 PM] Dylan Hackett
She nodded once, **"From what I gathered, Paige Underwood is a cornerstone member of a faction that was once believed to be completely wiped out. Horizon Grey."**


[12/17/2024 10:28 PM] Dylan Hackett឵
**"I am a nerd, you know this already, right? So, I tried searching the net regarding information on her and found nothing. Clean. I figured it was just 'sensitive information' and tried searching our database... Which is restricted to me."** She began stammering a little **"B-but I am not bothered by that! It's... not my place to question why."**


[12/18/2024 12:43 AM] Mason Reed
"Haha.." *Mason chuckled from her stampering.* "I gotcha, what you've pulled up is good enough. Knowing you, you've probably went through hidden sites and the like." *There was a slight pause from Mason.* 

"..Regardless, I'm sure the people we'll be meeting up with will provide us with what's necessary. Though, that 80% force reduction is still bugging me to what could have caused it."


[12/21/2024 9:07 PM] Dylan Hackett
**"I should just stop thinking about it, unless I want to get written up again..."**


[12/22/2024 10:36 PM] Mason Reed
"Written up..." *Mason muttered under his breath. Yeah, best to avoid that in the CCR.* "Well, I guess we should be heading over to the site." *He turned back to Rob.* "Anything else you wanna ask?"


[12/22/2024 10:53 PM] Rob Upton
He was already on his way out the room. All Mason was able to see was the heel of his boot.


[12/23/2024 10:07 PM] Mason Reed
"..." *He should've expected that.* "Hm, then we'll be on our way Dylan, take care." *With a wave he turned around and made his way out of the room to catch up with Rob. An unknown feeling resided within Mason, one of fear or uncertainty? He honestly didn't know, all he could do was pray that this last mission would be a breeze.*


[12/24/2024 10:00 PM] Narration
Outside, Mason would see that Rob transferring some items from the back of the patrol vehicle they used towards the front. In his hand was a rifle in which was inspecting at the time of Mason's appearance.


[12/24/2024 10:00 PM] Rob Upton
**"..."**


[12/24/2024 10:53 PM] Mason Reed
*Mason made his way up to Mason and the vehicle while eyeing his weapon.* "Everything alright?" *He inquired.* "You started acting a bit funny once we saw Dylan... Don't tell me you..." *He left his sentence open, waiting for Rob to finish it.*


[12/24/2024 10:56 PM] Rob Upton
The moment he ended with 'you', the bolt carrier group for the rifle slammed forward, loading a round into the chamber. **"Don't think too much about it."** He said, stowing the rifle along the back of the passenger seat. **"I much rather get this callout over with and take a long shower."**


[12/24/2024 10:57 PM] Rob Upton
**"Your girl is waiting for you, remember?"** He said giving Mason a sideway's glance as he climbed into the Ion Enforcer.

[1/4/2025 11:42 PM] Narration
The police station was coming into view. Just as Cat was passing the exit-only gate. Everyone could see at least 5 Ion Enforcers leaving, light and sirens blaring as they raced to their destinations. The Red and blues lit up their cabin like a neon strip club. Just up ahead was the entrance to the vehicle storage of the police station.


[1/4/2025 11:44 PM] Paige
**"Busy night for Fairview."** She muttered, she held her hand out towards Mathias who was behind Cat.


[1/4/2025 11:44 PM] Mathias
He handed her a ballistic plate.


[1/4/2025 11:44 PM] Paige
She took the plate with both her hands and began shoving it into her vest.


[1/4/2025 11:46 PM] Cat Bayes
**"You guys think it's gonna turn into a firefight the moment we get out..?"** *Cat hadn't really thought about it until now, but this would be her first overt mission...no hiding away and doing her silly netrunner shit here, it just got real.*


[1/4/2025 11:48 PM] Mathias
**"No question about it."**


[1/4/2025 11:48 PM] Paige
**"Once we enter the vehicle depot, we'll have a secure space if you can disable __all__ access to the garage. Take out anyone who is inside the garage and then we'll continue to push through the police station until we find the holding cells."**


[1/4/2025 11:48 PM] Paige
**"This is going to be yet another time we'll need you more than ever, Cat."**

[1/4/2025 11:50 PM] Cat Bayes
*Hearing both Paige saying that and the sound of the guns racking from Ghost...Well, it was safe to say that Cat was feeling the pressure. Taking a deep breath, she gave them a nod.* **"I'm not gonna let you guys down...we're gonna get Kode out of there."**


[1/4/2025 11:57 PM] Narration
Cat pulled into the CCR vehicle parking area. As she rounded the corner, she could see several CCR agents loitering by their vehicles out in the yard. The bright white lights that illuminated the lot casted dreadful long shadows across the vehicles. Several APCs were parked along the back wall. The vehicle depot was just up ahead with the large sign "vehicle depot" showing the way.


[1/4/2025 11:58 PM] Paige
**"We should be able to pull right in, granted there are no vehicles on the inside blocking us."**


[1/4/2025 11:59 PM] Paige
She flipped her helmet off, allowing it to bounce off the front dash and down between her legs. Pushing her rifle in her armpit at a low-ready.


[1/5/2025 12:00 AM] Narration
The vehicle depot was a three garage door section of the police facility. One of the doors could be blocked.. Two...All of them or none. It was a gamble for sure.


[1/5/2025 12:02 AM] Ghost
*Ghost kept his posture ready, eyes scanning, and asked,* **“Move as a group or split into two teams?”**


[1/5/2025 12:04 AM] Paige
**"Staying as a group would allow us to fend off more lawmen if it comes down to it."**


[1/5/2025 12:05 AM] Cat Bayes
**"Seriously, no automatic doors for these things?"** *Cat looked between the garage doors and processed the information a bit. Looking off to the right, she noticed that the front door to the building was off to the right.*

*By that logic, that would mean the door leading __into__ the garage might be on the right as well, and if Cat was working here, she'd usually take the car closest to the door...right?*


[1/5/2025 12:05 AM] Cat Bayes
*Fuck it, three it is.*


[1/5/2025 12:07 AM] Ghost
*Ghost kept his stance firm, his gaze steady.* **“I work best alone.”**


[1/5/2025 12:09 AM] Paige
**"What's that supposed to mean?"** She asked, keeping her eyes out.


[1/5/2025 12:09 AM] Narration
Cat was now slowly approaching door 3. He better speak his piece quickly before that door opens.


[1/5/2025 12:12 AM] Ghost
*Ghost’s eyes briefly shifted towards her.* **“It means I don’t need distractions. I move __faster__, think __clearer__ when it’s just me.”** *He briefly activated his cybernetic ability for a brief second to demonstrate what he meant.*


[1/5/2025 12:15 AM] Mathias
**"Cat, you'll lock the building down. No one gets in or out. Afterwards, kill surveillance and communications to the outside. Cole, you'll handle the loose-ends that try to squeak. Me and Paige will look for Kode."**


[1/5/2025 12:16 AM] Paige
She nodded her head subtly.


[1/5/2025 12:17 AM] Cat Bayes
**"They won't know what hit em."** *Cat nodded, showing that she understood her assignment.*


[1/5/2025 12:19 AM] Ghost
*Ghost nodded subtly.*


[1/5/2025 12:20 AM] Narration
Cat driven close to door 3. The Ion Enforcer blipped with a chime and the doors began to open...


[1/5/2025 12:23 AM] Narration
The light from within the vehicle depot were nearly blinding as she pulled in. Once inside, the exposure died down and now she was fully inside of the vehicle depot! There were two other vehicles in the other bays, choosing bay 3 was the best choice! However, there were 6 lawmen inside of the vehicle depot, still unaware of what was about to transpire. Ahead of them was a door that led to the employee locker rooms. (Denoted by the holographic sign above the door.) To their left were the other bays and what made up most of the garage. Rolling carts and vehicle equipment would provide ample cover when the fighting broke out...


[1/5/2025 12:23 AM] Narration
The garage door behind their vehicle began to close.


[1/5/2025 12:24 AM] Mathias
**"The moment the door closes, we're live."**


[1/5/2025 12:25 AM] Narration
**Boom.** The door closed.

He kicked open his door and pointed his handgun out into the bay and began firing upon the CCR lawmen.


[1/5/2025 12:26 AM] Paige
She hopped out the passenger side and closed the door. Quickly she jogged to the front corner of the Ion Enforcer and began firing into the agents alongside Mathias.


[1/5/2025 12:28 AM] Narration
Mathias, delivered a percise headshot on one the lawmen on the catwalk on the second level. His head rebounded backwards. Stumbling until he hit the wall behind him and fell forward. Slipping between the gaps in the railing. His partner who he was beside received a round to the neck which prompted him to drop to the ground. Rolling in pain and fear as he could no longer breathe.


[1/5/2025 12:28 AM] Narration
Two down...


[1/5/2025 12:29 AM] Ghost
*Ghost readjusted his seat to its original position, waiting for the right moment to strike. When the time came, he kicked his door open with both legs, the force nearly breaking it off its hinges. He had already pinpointed his targets. Activating his cloak, he became semi-transparent, swiftly drawing both handguns. With precision, he fired **six** rounds, three in each target.*


[1/5/2025 12:30 AM] Narration
Paige wasn't a sharpshooter veteran, but she wasn't terrible either. She sent a burst towards one of them, the round found it's mark on one of their arms, blowing his forearm off the rest of his body as he recoiled in pain and dropped behind one of the vehicles. The other three managed to find some cover and were now working on returning fire. He picked one off in the head, immediately he stopped moving and was in a prone state beside his two comrades that were remaining.


[1/5/2025 12:33 AM] Cat Bayes
*Meanwhile, Cat had moved over to the passenger seat of the car and was __aggressively__ ripping the network's security protocols to shreds. Any potential outbound communications were swiftly blocked and the alarm system rendered useless. Surveillance? What surveillance, nobody needed to know what was happening here...~*

Her eyes shot open and she looked over her shoulder towards where the source of the sound was originating from. `"Are those..."` Then, everything began going dark saved for the back up power keeping the access control enabled. The room she was in had glass walls. Everything outside the dispatcher's room was pitch black saved for static red lights that gave some visiblity. The door was locked, siginified by the red light on the device above the door.

`"A terrorist attack?! Here?!"` Her heart began jumping.

Several lawmen ran past the office, armed as they ran towards the source of the violence.

Ghost managed to get to their flank. Clearly able to see the two officers attempting to return blind fire towards Paige and Mathias.


[1/5/2025 12:43 AM] Narration
Supressive fire was EFFECTIVE


[1/5/2025 12:44 AM] Paige
Paige would sprint from the Enforcer towards the door that would lead them to the rest of the police station. From there, she found concealment behind a cart and continued to lay effective supressive fire on the last two lawmen's location.


[1/5/2025 12:45 AM] Mathias
He finally stepped out from the vehicle and slowly began strafing towards the front of the Enforcer they came in with. Already working on getting into position to siege the rest of the police station. All that was left was for Cole to neutralize these assholes.


[1/5/2025 12:48 AM] Dylan Hackett
`"They tell you to bunker in place, b-but I don't recall if these glass windows were bullet proof or not..."` She eyed the door, hacking her way out of here was an option she considered. If she could just get a message out, maybe there was hope.


[1/5/2025 12:48 AM] Dylan Hackett
`"Think think think!"` She squeezed her eyes shut, trying to come up with a solution.


[1/5/2025 12:48 AM] Ghø$tw@lk
*Ghost stood right behind them, his dual handguns aimed directly at the base of their skulls. Without hesitation, he pulled the triggers. The sound of gunfire split the air as their brains exploded, spilling their lives in an instant. Lights out.*


[1/5/2025 12:49 AM] Narration
Gunfire within the vehicle depot ceased... All the lawmen here were killed.


[1/5/2025 12:49 AM] Narration
Shouting could be heard from the door Paige and Mathias were now at. Pounding soon followed, they were attempting to gain entry to the depot.


[1/5/2025 12:53 AM] Cat Bayes
*Kchink! The door's light flashed red as the deadbolts set in place. If those doors were as durable as Cat believed them to be, it would take a few minutes before those lawmen would be able to bust through.*

*Mathias, Cole, and Paige's opticals flashed with an incoming call from Cat...*

```fix
"I've got access to their surveillance system, that door you guys are perched at is covered in goons on the other side."
```


[1/5/2025 12:54 AM] Mathias
`"Got a way to occupy them for precisely two seconds?"` He'd ask, as he eyed the door.


[1/5/2025 12:55 AM] Cat Bayes
```fix
"Other than locking doors on em? Lemme see..."
```
*What were her options here...*


[1/5/2025 12:58 AM] Narration
Since these were not special forces junkies she was dealing with. The amount of ram it would take to give them a brief jolt was reliable. However, she would have to keep in mind, she is having to deal with many systems each need their own allocations. She could try it and risk not having enough ram if something outside the realm of she knows of occurs. Take on a few of them and leave the rest to Cole, Mathias, and Paige. Or their on their own and keep all her free ram space unallocated incase something big does occur.


[1/5/2025 1:03 AM] Cat Bayes
*Hm...no wait, this is something she can actually work with. She doesn't need to knock all of them out, but just a few would do the trick if they needed a distraction.*

```fix
"Alright, I've got an idea. I'm gonna short circuit some of their buddies, see if they don't take their eyes off the door. Once I do, I'll open it and you guys can take care of the rest."
```
*Cat instructed as she watched the camera, before turning her eyes up to Mathias and Paige.*

```fix
"Ready?"
```


[1/5/2025 1:04 AM] Mathias
`"Yeah."`


[1/5/2025 1:04 AM] Paige
`"Came this far, why not?"`


[1/5/2025 1:04 AM] Ghost
*Cole had his guns aimed at the door, his fingers ready to empty the magazines if necessary.*


[1/5/2025 1:05 AM] Mathias
`"Cole, you first out, get past these guys. Paige and I will take care of them."`


[1/5/2025 1:06 AM] Ghost
*He nodded and stepped closer to the door, his cybernetic ability growing more potent the longer he remained still.*


[1/5/2025 1:10 AM] Cat Bayes
```fix
"Three...two..."
```
*On the other side of the door, muffled screams and the sound of electricity frying could be heard, accompanied by panicked shouting right after. A few seconds later, the door's lights flashed green and-*

```fix
"Now!"
```

*Pistons fired and the door shot open!*


[1/5/2025 1:11 AM] Ghost
*Ghost moved through the room, careful and methodical, making sure not to bump into any of them. Whenever possible, he pressed himself against the wall to avoid detection.*


[1/5/2025 1:12 AM] Narration
Ghost entered the room and weaved out of it quickly. He was out of the killzone the moment Mathias and Paige were able to get into the room and began opening fire. First targetting those who were distracted. The zapped motherfuckers will be a close second...


[1/5/2025 1:14 AM] Narration
Ghost exited the locker room and into a hallway. The main lights were turned off, saved for the static red lights. Aside from the gunshots going off behind him, the way ahead was quiet....


[1/5/2025 1:15 AM] Narration
Everything was going smoothly. If Cat was still aware of her surroundings. She would notice a camera in the corner ceiling moved.


[1/5/2025 1:17 AM] Cat Bayes
**"Hm?"** *Cat peeked at the camera in the ceiling for a moment, did it just...?*

*No, she can't leave anything to chance, Cat shifted her gaze to the camera and began attempting to hijack it.*


[1/5/2025 1:18 AM] Narration
Cat managed to gain control of the camera relatively quickly. Either it was her imagination or whoever used it got out of it really quick...


[1/5/2025 1:19 AM] Dylan Hackett
`"They killed everyone in there..."` She thought to her self, her eyes dimming as she was just coming out of the programming.


[1/5/2025 1:19 AM] Ghost
*He scanned his surroundings, remaining tense and aware, then signaled for a status update. Through his neural deck, he asked,* **“What’s my current route?”**


[1/5/2025 1:22 AM] Cat Bayes
**"..."** *Mmh...Nope, this could be a problem.*

```fix
"We got a problem guys, there might be another netrunner here."
```
*She reported through the call, jumping out of the camera as she started working her way through the system protocols.*
```fix
"I'm not sure where they're at, but they could pose a problem later if they're left alone. Ghost, you go that?"
```


[1/5/2025 1:23 AM] Dylan Hackett
`"Establish comms.... Comms... Comms... "` Her eyes illuminated as she began scouring for any access point that wasn't compromised.


[1/5/2025 1:24 AM] Narration
To her dismay, Cat must've had the black ice READY. Wonder where she got it from...


[1/5/2025 1:24 AM] Ghost
# **”Update me on their position. I’ll neutralize them,”** *he said, his voice cold.*


[1/5/2025 1:25 AM] Dylan Hackett
`"This netrunner is crazy good..."` With that in mind, her eyes widened. She immediately stopped interfacing with the net. She also covered her mouth. `"If they are that good... They can backtrace me."`


[1/5/2025 1:25 AM] Cat Bayes
```fix
"Working on that, I'll update you as you go."
```
*Cat was busy looking for traces of their activity on the net, attempting to locate them.*
```fix
"For now, let's focus on dealing with stragglers."
```


[1/5/2025 1:27 AM] Dylan Hackett
`"I don't want to die..."` She felt hopeless in this situation.  She began to whimper as she crawled underneath a desk. `"...The best I can do is barricade myself in here..."`


[1/5/2025 1:28 AM] Narration
Ghost continued moving forward. Office rooms were on his left and right.. Then his left and right again. Most of them were closed.. He could breach them or move forward. (He had 4 doors in front of him. 2 on the left and 2 on the right.)


[1/5/2025 1:29 AM] Narration
Beyond these four rooms the hallway goes into a t-intersection.

Pinned a message.


[1/5/2025 1:32 AM] Ghost
*Ghost opted to breach the doors on his left, starting with the first. Guns trained and ready, he moved swiftly, his body brimming with focused intensity as he attempted to kick the door open!*


[1/5/2025 1:32 AM] Narration
The door gave... Empty office, no targets.


[1/5/2025 1:34 AM] Cat Bayes
*In the meantime, Cat was rapidly shifting through cameras in an attempt to locate their elusive netrunner, only to find-*

*-A woman, huddled underneath a desk, whimpering in fear. Cat's heart immediately sunk; that wasn't the netrunner...was it?*


[1/5/2025 1:34 AM] Ghost
*He quickly moved to the second door, repeating the process with the same precision and readiness.*


[1/5/2025 1:35 AM] Narration
The second door gave. Empty office, no targets.


[1/5/2025 1:36 AM] Narration
Cat noticed that from her angle with the camera, her eyes were illuminated... She indeed was the netrunner.


[1/5/2025 1:36 AM] Ghost
*He moved to the right side, repeating the process with cold efficiency. By now, his movements had become so automated, he almost seemed like a machine.*


[1/5/2025 1:37 AM] Narration
Third door, same result. Guess no one important was in today.


[1/5/2025 1:38 AM] Cat Bayes
*Fucking hell, she looked like a kid! Why was she here, why was she a fucking netrunner for the CCR?*

*It was no wonder why she had such an easy time with their system, that girl was clearly inexperienced with situations like this...*


[1/5/2025 1:38 AM] Ghost
*Fourth door… pretty please? Some killing please?*


[1/5/2025 1:38 AM] Cat Bayes
*Ghostgaze had to be closing in on her location, she didn't want this to happen, the girl wasn't a threat...was she?*

*Fuck fuck fuck!*I


[1/5/2025 1:39 AM] Narration
The moment he kicked the door it, a blast sent him against the opposite wall with force. Knocking the wind out of him. He was shot in the chest. If he doesn't dive  left or right, he might just get head shotted by whoever decided to give him a round.


[1/5/2025 1:41 AM] Cat Bayes
*She heard the boom, and immediately switched off the feed to the hallway Ghost was located in...While she was somewhat relieved it wasn't the office the girl was in, she was now concerned with the new threat he was facing.*

```fix
"Ghost, you alright?!"
```


[1/5/2025 1:43 AM] Ghost
*Ghost gritted his teeth, forcing himself to breathe through the pain. Adrenaline surged as he instinctively rolled to the right, narrowly avoiding another shot. His cybernetic reflexes kicked in, activating his ability. With hasty movements, he reached for his guns, which had been knocked from his hands, his fingers brushing against them as he prepared to fight back, returning fire!*


[1/5/2025 1:45 AM] Narration
Three more bullets went into the cinderblock backed wall. Dust kicked up heavily in the hallway and shrapnel struck one of the lights on the ceiling. Causing a cascading spark festival to descend onto Ghost. Ghost was on an angle, firing at the door at his unknown assailant. This angle was bad for both of them. Ghost had options as he returned fire, he could push or fall back to a position more suitable for a firefight.


[1/5/2025 1:46 AM] Narration
**Doesn't feel good when it happens to you, huh?!"** A masculine voice shouted over underneath the hail of gunfire.


[1/5/2025 1:48 AM] Narration
Ghost's shot were wild. Most of the rounds chipping at the doorframe and hitting the sliver of a wall he was able to see at that given time. Unable to actually see his true destination.


[1/5/2025 1:50 AM] Narration
Cat noticed something on her systems was ripped from her control. Access Control for a single door...


[1/5/2025 1:51 AM] Cat Bayes
**"Hm?"** *Was it the netrunner girl? Cat pulled up a separate feed of the camera for that room.*


[1/5/2025 1:52 AM] Narration
Sure enough, the girl was syncing to the door of her room. Sending constant commands to it; Lock. She was desperate to keep anyone who could come in __out.__


[1/5/2025 1:54 AM] Ghost
*Ghost’s grip tightened on his guns, waiting for the right moment. He would push forward the moment he was given a window of opportunity, because at some point they would have to reload or run out of ammo.*


[1/5/2025 1:56 AM] Cat Bayes
**"..."** *Mathias and Paige would probably scold her for doing something like this, but honestly? That girl was pretty much hopeless against the Black Ice, and all she was trying to do was survive.*

*It reminded her of the shop...*

*Breathing a deep sigh, she rapidly pivoted the camera from left to right in an attempt to get her attention.*


[1/5/2025 1:56 AM] Lt. John
The man would emerge from the room, one hand extended outwards and a handgun in the other. A direction shield (Guardian Protocol Cybernetic-ware) would emit from the palm of his hand as he began to __PUSH__ Ghost. He'd fire upon him with slow but deliberate shots.


[1/5/2025 1:59 AM] Dylan Hackett
She was steadily crying beneath the desk. The sound the camera made as it pivoted grabbed her blurry eyes' attention. `"Their mocking me... I'm pathetic, I know..."`


[1/5/2025 2:00 AM] Cat Bayes
**"No you stupid- Grrh!"**

*The camera wasn't gonna work, the girl was far too gone in the throes of shock. She needed something elll...*

*Suddenly, the computer's monitor flashed on in Dylan's office! Was it the netrunner's doing?*


[1/5/2025 2:02 AM] Ghost
*Ghost immediately disengaged, retreating to a more advantageous position, seeking cover behind the nearest wall. His ability remained active, his awareness was heightened as he assessed his new opponent. This man was… **different**. More formidable than anyone he’d encountered in the CCR so far. Ghost returned fire with precision this time, sidestepping to avoid incoming shots.*


[1/5/2025 2:04 AM] Lt. John
The kinetic rounds struck the shield and effortlessly bounced right off and went into haywire. He'd follow the distorted imagery of Ghost. The way he was glitching about made target acquisition a pain in the ass. **"Hold still you fucking pussy."** He continued to move forward.

*The computer wasn't going through it's normal boot process, or even showed the desktop. Instead, it was a blue screen with a string of white text.*

`You. Cannot. Stay.`


[1/5/2025 2:08 AM] Ghost
*Ghost knew holding still would be a death sentence, John wouldn’t be able to see him either, and he’d lose his advantage. He needed to think fast. As he shifted position, he activated his comms.*

`“I need you to focus. Can you short-circuit this guy’s gear?”` *he asked, his voice cold, every second counting.*

The first one, cracked a section of his shield. The second was placed dead on the first intrusion, shattering it and the last one? Well. John's forehead split into two loose hanging chunks. Blood splatting against the wall and his body slid down the height of the wall. Then, as he was put in a seated position, his body fell over to the side.

Those last four shots were enough for her to get her ass into gear. Stumbling initially, she quickly went to the door and unlocked it and now she was in the hallway. Looking left, looking right. Where did those shots come from again? Right, they came from the right. So, she went left!

[1/5/2025 2:36 AM] Dylan Hackett
She was at the end of the hallway looking back to see Ghost down the hall. Without much of a thought aside from getting away from Ghost, she took off and vanished down another hall. The sound of another door beeping filled the hall.


[1/5/2025 2:38 AM] Ghost
*From anyone’s perspective, it seems like a literal ghost was chasing her. His form flickered in and out, the glitching making him appear as an eerie, unnatural presence. He closed the distance, relentless, before sprinting after her once more.*

```fix
"She's in a vault, with no access to the NET and without a weapon."
```
*Cat's voice sounded tense, but Ghost probably recognized the emotion in her voice...it was fear, or perhaps sorrow?*
```fix
"She can't open the door, and I'm keeping it that way. 
She. Is. Neutralized."
```


[1/5/2025 2:51 AM] Mathias
`"Has she seen anyone?"` Mathias chimed in over the comms.


[1/5/2025 2:52 AM] Ghost
`“Not the first time someone’s gone back on their word,”` *he sighed, a brief silence hanging in the air.*

*After a moment, he responded to Mathias,* `“She’s seen me.”`


[1/5/2025 2:53 AM] Paige
`"..."`


[1/5/2025 2:53 AM] Cat Bayes
```fix
"I-"
```
*Fuck, the camera before...Did she see Mathias and Paige?*


[1/5/2025 2:54 AM] Cat Bayes
*She sucked in her breath, pinching her temple.*
**"God fucking damnit, you stupid kid...why were you here?"**


[1/5/2025 2:55 AM] Mathias
`"I want everyone to think about this carefully. We've killed dozens of lawmen in Fairview. They'll be out for blood. Are we willing to risk everything on a person we do not know?"`


[1/5/2025 2:56 AM] Mathias
`"We secured Kode, Paige and I have did our part. Do yours how you see fit."` He'd disconnect completely.


[1/5/2025 2:57 AM] Ghost
*His voice was ice-cold,* `“This isn’t the time for emotions, Cat. We’re dealing with the CCR—there are no exceptions.”`


[1/5/2025 2:58 AM] Cat Bayes
```fix
"..."
```
*The mission was over, Mathias and Paige were inbound with Kode in tow and their path was relatively clear. This should've been it. But Cat just had to go and get this kid killed in the process.*
```fix
"...You're right, I'm sorry."
```


[1/5/2025 2:59 AM] Cat Bayes
*She couldn't risk Paige or Mathias being compromised, there was too much riding on this.*

*Sorry kid, it was all Cat could do to keep you safe...you just had to join the CCR, didn't you...? Within seconds, the vault door's lights flashed green and the hydraulics hissed, before it slowly swung open.*

She spun around, clearly she was trying to find __SOMETHING__ she could use to defend herself with if it came down to it. The vault opened and standing in front of the vault was Ghost.


[1/5/2025 3:03 AM] Ghost
*Ghost stood there, menacing and unrelenting. His large, glitching frame flickered in and out of existence—a side effect of keeping his ability active for too long. His mind was locked onto a singular focus, too **fixated** to deactivate it.*

*What was he staring at?*

**"Please… just listen to me. I—I don’t know what you think I did, but I swear, I’m not like them!"** She began backing up, rolling carts started shifting as her weight bumped against them.


[1/5/2025 3:07 AM] Cat Bayes
*Cat listened through Ghost's connection. She couldn't bring herself to hang up.*


[1/5/2025 3:09 AM] Ghost
*Ghost advanced slowly, each step **deliberate** and **heavy**, his footsteps echoing loudly.*

She shook her head violently, this was all a bad dream. She fell asleep and this was nothing but a nightmare! **No. This. Was. Real.** **"I didn’t have a choice! It’s my job. I don’t make the rules—I just… follow them. Please, you have to believe me. I’ve never hurt anyone. I needed to survive. But I never—never once wanted to hurt anyone. Please, just let me go. I’ll quit. I’ll disappear. You’ll never see me again"** She stumbles falls backwards!

She was sobbing uncontrollably, but throughout the sobs, she still managed to plea for her life, scooting back with what little room she had.

**"“I’m not like them! I’ve never even held a gun! Please, I’ll do anything. I have a family back at home that __NEEDS ME!__ PLEASE!!!"**


[1/5/2025 3:16 AM] Cat Bayes
*Cat clenched her teeth through the pleas of the girl, desperately wanting to hang up.*

~~She couldn't.~~

*God damnit, why...did she sound like __Her__? Why did she have to sound just like Cat?*


[1/5/2025 3:16 AM] Ghost
*Ghost closed the distance, advancing until there was almost no room left for her to retreat. Slowly, deliberately, he raised both hands, reaching toward her with a steady and unsettling calm. He was…*


[1/5/2025 3:20 AM] Dylan Hackett
**"Stay away from me!!! PLEASE STAY AWAY FROM ME, I DONT WANT TO DIE!!!! I AM NOT READY TO DIE YET!!!!"** She'd shriek, swinging her arm around as she was now against the wall. No where else to run Dylan...

*Behind the mask was **Cole Mercer.** He stood frozen for a moment, staring at the ground where his mask had fallen.*
# *It was off. His mask was off.*
*The realization hit him hard, and his adrenaline quickly faded. His eyes shifted to his hands, then back to Dylan.*
-# **“She’s… just a kid?”**
-# **“A kid… working for the CCR?”**
*He stumbled backward, trying to process the weight of it all. As his gaze dropped to his trembling hands, a memory flashed in his mind—the same shaking he felt when facing that monster back at the factory. Something was different. Something about this moment was wrong.*

*No matter how much he tried to rationalize it, the truth remained.*
# *She was just a kid.*
*The thought pounded in his head, unrelenting, forcing him to confront the reality of the situation.*

*With a heavy sigh, Cole __cut the comms__ and stepped forward. He picked up his mask, holding it like a relic he __no longer__ wanted to wear.*

*He turned back to her, studying her in silence. This time, he truly saw her—not as an enemy, not as a target, but as a **frightened child.***

*His eyes widened, the weight of it all crashing down on him. He stepped closer, and in a swift motion, delivered a precise __neck chop__, knocking her unconscious in a single, fluid movement. Her body slumped to the ground, still, but **alive.***

*Cole stood there for a moment, mask in hand, his face unreadable. Then, without a word, he turned and walked away.*

# The decision made.

[1/5/2025 3:37 AM] Cat Bayes
*...Why...was there no gunshot? She just went quiet all of a sudden.*
```fix
"...Ghost?"
```
*No response, the line was cut. She had no idea what had happened, just left sitting there in silence as she continued to hold her breath.*


[1/5/2025 3:39 AM] Narration
The door leading back into the Vehicle Depot opened with Mathias and Paige carrying an unconscious Kode on their shoulders.


[1/5/2025 3:39 AM] Paige
`"Cat, can you take a moment and open the back seat? He's not light in the slightest!"`  She'd ask


[1/5/2025 3:41 AM] Ghost
*Ghost reappeared in the distance, his mask securely in place. His steps were slow but deliberate, each one measured as he made his way back toward the vehicle.*


[1/5/2025 3:42 AM] Cat Bayes
**"Y-Yeah."** *Klack- The heavy door swung open with Kat at the back seat.*


[1/5/2025 3:43 AM] Narration
Paige and Mathias began to cram Kode in the back seat.


[1/5/2025 3:43 AM] Mathias
**"We are going to need two vehicles."** He would then move over towards another vehicle in the depot.


[1/5/2025 3:44 AM] Paige
**"...Did you do it?"** She'd ask Ghost straight up as he approached.


[1/5/2025 3:45 AM] Ghost
*Ghost glanced at Paige for a brief moment before responding,* **“Mission’s done. Nothing to worry about.”**


[1/5/2025 3:46 AM] Cat Bayes
*Cat was sitting back in the driver seat, evidently avoiding Ghost's (heh) gaze.*


[1/5/2025 3:46 AM] Paige
**"Actually, it is something to worry about."** She followed after him. **"I need to know... We, need to know."**


[1/5/2025 3:53 AM] Ghost
*He followed Mathias to the vehicle and opened the passenger door. Before getting in, he glanced at Paige one last time.* **“Go verify it for yourself. That’s my answer.”** *He climbed in, then slammed the door shut.*


[1/5/2025 3:54 AM] Paige
**"Fuck it! Cole..."** He was frustrating her. **"Ugh... Mathias, don't you go __anywhere__. Cat, come on.."** She would start briskly walking back into the police station,


[1/5/2025 3:56 AM] Cat Bayes
**"H-Huh?"** *Was it really alright for them to do this? Wait, shit, Paige was already heading for-*

*Opening the car door, she scrambled out of the car and chased after her friend.* **"Hey, wait up!"**


[1/5/2025 3:57 AM] Mathias
He would sigh. But he didn't say anything.


[1/5/2025 3:58 AM] Ghost
*Cole remained silent, he was facing his handgun, and pondered.*


[1/5/2025 3:59 AM] Narration
A few turns here, a few there and Paige and Cat managed to reach the vault which had Dylan laying motionless on the ground.


[1/5/2025 3:59 AM] Paige
**"..."** Paige descended beside Dylan first. Checking her pulse. **"She's alive."** She announced.


[1/5/2025 3:59 AM] Paige
**"That fucking asshole."** She'd mutter to herself.


[1/5/2025 4:00 AM] Cat Bayes
**"..."** *Cat was standing at the entrance of the vault, staring at the girl's motionless body...watching as she still drew breath.* **"She's...alive?"**

*Her shoulders dropped, the tension left her body. Placing her hand against the metallic frame of the door, she breathed a sigh of relief.* **"That fucking asshole..."**


[1/5/2025 4:02 AM] Paige
She'd collect Dylan's body and hoist her up. **"We're taking her with us. They'll retaliate against __anyone__ involved in this raid."**


[1/5/2025 4:04 AM] Cat Bayes
**"Right...they'd label her as an accomplice if they just found her lying here."** *Cat nodded, it made the most sense...and besides, they need to figure out if she knows anything.*


[1/5/2025 4:09 AM] Narration
With the two returning to the depot, Paige and Cat could see that Mathias and Cole's vehicle was already started and ready to go.


[1/5/2025 4:09 AM] Paige
She began working on strapping both Kode and Dylan. Safety first since the unconcious aren't able to brace for any forms of impact.


[1/5/2025 4:11 AM] Ghost
*He stared up at the roof of the car, his gaze distant, a look reserved for someone lost in thought, reflecting on the choices he made.*


[1/5/2025 4:14 AM] Cat Bayes
*Cat was about to climb into the driver seat of their Enforcer, but not before turning to give the car Mathias and Ghostgaze were in a look.*
**"..."**
*Without saying a word, she turned and climbed into the SUV and closed the door, the engine sputtering to life shortly after.*

[1/13/2025 7:48 PM] Aurora King
Aurora was the first to spill out onto the streets beneath their apartment. Her eyes adjusting the relatively clear day. Aside from the scattered clouds, it was a brisk morning. She turned back around to see if Mason was just behind her.


[1/13/2025 8:19 PM] Mason Reed
*He was! Well, not directly behind her, but close enough.* "Hopefully it stays clear all day, anymore rain and I might actually develop PTSD." *He made his way to the Ion Enforcer and unlocked the doors.*


[1/13/2025 8:30 PM] Aurora King
She would pull on the door handle and it would open with a bit of force applied. It caused her to backpedal just a little in a bid to avoid being smacked by the door. **"I still can't fathom you drive this thing around like an everyday crawler."** She commented as she literally had to *climb* into it.


[1/13/2025 8:51 PM] Mason Reed
*Mason watched Aurora climb into the car with a smirk of pride.* "Pretty awesome, huh? Compared to a regular SUV, the Ion Enforcer is an absolute beast. It's heavily armored to handle serious damage, plus it boasts incredible acceleration and top-notch speed. I've had it long enough to get clearance to upgrade its suspension system—now it has higher ground clearance, better off-road performance, and upgraded coil springs and shock absorbers so riding will feel as smooth as butter, and it reduces fatigue on long trips. Of course it can be hard to drive in for the regular person, but the challenge of taming this beast makes it all worth it—"

*Yeah he went on and on about the peak truck known as the Ion Enforcer.* "You probably have to climb into it because your fun siz—" *He stopped himself.* "...Uh, small and adorable."

**"Uhuh."** She gave him a knowing look before settling down into the large seat. Immediately, she went to pull down the visor where the mirror was located. Digging into her pocket, she pulled out some handheld make-up products and got right to work. **"Don't go running over a family of 9 while you're taming your 'beast.' You'll ruin my make-up gig... Sent you the location."**


[1/13/2025 9:03 PM] Narration
The GPS on Mason's deck indeed receive the location of the conference. Near the river that seperates Fairview and Neon Kyrie. NICE!


[1/13/2025 9:09 PM] Mason Reed
"...Man at least pretend to care. :(" *He just got into the car, turned it on and put in the coordinates. She might not appreciate the explanation, but she WILL know how smooth this ride is—*


[1/13/2025 9:15 PM] Aurora King
**"How has your partnership with Rob been this time around?"** She asked during the initial portion of their ride. Still doing her make-up.


[1/13/2025 9:30 PM] Mason Reed
"Rob? He was fine to work with. Still pretty awkward, but that's part of his...charm I guess? Pretty sure he has a thing for one of our dispatchers too. Guy can't speak a word to her."


[1/13/2025 9:33 PM] Aurora King
**"..?"** She paused her make-up process to glance over towards Mason who was busy driving. **"He's __fine__ to work with? Haven't you two been partners for eons?"**


[1/13/2025 9:44 PM] Mason Reed
"...?" *He raised a brow.* "Yeah? 'Fine' means he's great to work with. We've been working together for so long now that everything feels natural, so it's fine. Not in a bad way of course. Sorry if that sounded like a nonchalant answer."


[1/21/2025 8:46 PM] Aurora King
She shrugged, satisfied with the answer. Now doing her eyelashes. **"The dude's always been a total oddball, in my book. I figured he'd be a corporate drone when we were kids in the mesh."**


[1/21/2025 9:31 PM] Mason Reed
*Mason chuckled.* "Nah, he's not like that. He's just someone that doesn't prefer to get into any deep mess." *He slightly turned his head to Aurora.* "I'd say most people in our mesh got..some unique jobs, though."


[1/21/2025 9:33 PM] Aurora King
**"Like who"** She asked as she moved towards the second eye set of eyelashes.


[1/21/2025 10:06 PM] Mason Reed
"Well me and Rob for starters, we bounced between school and CCR training pretty frequently. For others..."
-# sideeye :bombasticsideeye:
"I didn't expect you to become a streamer, but it fits you."


[1/21/2025 10:28 PM] Aurora King
**"We've talked about this before, boo..."** She fluttered her eyes a few time before putting the cap back on her product. **"It wasn’t my life calling when I was five; I just happened to be good at games, and the tournaments rolled in like clockwork. Though, I don't see myself doing it forever. Just long enough to rake in livable micros from the royalties, you know?"** She finally looked his way.


[1/21/2025 11:07 PM] Mason Reed
"Yeah, I know," *He said, a small smile forming.* "I don't mean that it's your life calling, it's just that you just seem like the kind of person who'd be popular. You're stylish, you've got that effortless charm and the like."


[1/21/2025 11:15 PM] Aurora King
She would give him a side eye, a shit eating grin. **"Is that why you chose to broadcast your undying love for me on the day of your academy grad in front of everyone? Real slick move."** With a nostalgic sigh, she rested her head against the headrest and gazed out the window. **"My folks were all in, thinking we were about to get hitched on the spot. You should've seen their faces when I dropped the bomb that marriage is just a bug in the programmin' and a total waste of time and micros. Felt so good... Stickin' it to them for all the bullshit..."**

"........." *The calm air that Mason normally had was quickly transitioned into something else entirely. His smile was replaced with a confused, cold stare.* "**Dear...** I'm not entirely sure what you mean by that..." *His gaze slightly turned back toward her, waiting for her to elaborate further.*


[1/22/2025 3:51 PM] Aurora King
Aurora raised an eyebrow at his reaction, her grin faltering only slightly. **"What? C'mon, Mason, don't tell me you're mad about me thinkin' this way."** Leaning back in her seat with an exasperated laugh. **"I mean, yeah, maybe I could’ve been eased up on the gas about the phrasin'... But I still really like you, like no joke. One of many reasons why we are together, right?"** She grimanced a little.

**"I mean, you gotta admit, the graduation was something, right? My parents were all over it like viruses. It was sweet and at the same time, it was a great platform for me to stick it to them in a different way."** Her tone softened, and she glanced at him, her grin returning but with a slight nervous edge. **"You’re not mad about it... are you?"**

*There was a short silence after she finished, his expression was unreadable to a degree. It was hard for her to tell if he was mad or not.* 

"...Mad? No, not mad," *He said, his tone calm but sterm.* "You do have a knack for dropping bombs and acting like they're confetti, Aurora. And yea, the graduation? That was definitely *something*. It was a sweet moment for all of us, but, sticking it to your parents in the middle of everything? I don't know... It just felt like you were carrying your fight into a moment that could've been about celebrating you. I mean, I get how you feel about your parents, but I just don't understand why."

*He paused before speaking again.* "Of course, I like you, too—no, I love you, I don't ever doubt that. Hell, I don't even think I can get truly mad at you, not that great of a feeling. Though, I guess I am a little disappointed that in the moment, getting at your parents took precedence..." *There was no anger in his voice only genuine curiosity and a faint trace of concern.*

Aurora's eyes widened slightly at Mason's words, and her grin vanished. She shifted uncomfortably in her seat, realizing the depth of his disappointment. Her feelings were a tangled mix of emotions—surprise at his reaction, a hint of defensiveness, and a growing sense of realization. She turned away from him, looking out the car window, her voice quiet and thoughtful as she responded.

**"Listen, I..."** Aurora paused, her voice trailing off as she considered her words. She was used to being the brash firecracker, but now she was on the receiving end. Leaving her vulnerable. **"I didn't think..."** she continued, her tone apologetic and sincere. **"—I didn’t think about how it’d mess with the whole scene. Or you, for that matter. I’m always caught up in the grind of finally getting some payback for all the static they put me through..."**


[1/22/2025 5:20 PM] Narration
The venue where they were heading was just ahead. Turning into the parking lot was all that was left.


[1/22/2025 5:20 PM] Aurora King
She sank in her seat a little, feeling miserable. It was rare for Aurora to express any form of vulnerability in such a way, yet there was an unmistakable shift in her tone as she admitted, **"I'm no whiz at this, you know? This is one of /those/ reasons. thanks to my glitches. Forget the drama—let's have fun today."**

Certainly, her parents played such a huge role in her life that every waking moment revolved around them, something that should be uprooted in the future.

"Yeah..." *Without even having to look at her Mason knew just how much his words impacted her, more than he thought it would to be honest. Mason turned left into the parking lot and continued speaking.*

"It's alright, Aurora. That's that, this is this... I'm not the type to hold grudges, most of the time. Plus, I know you have a reasons for what you do, I'd just like to have a little bit more insight to why, y'know? I also don't want you stressing yourself out over your parents. In that sense, they still have influence over your thoughts in actions."

Mason pulled into the venue, the parking lot of a large shopping area. On the other side of the parking lot was the building where the conference was being held. A line formed at the side entrance, which they used to process all the 'fans' who wanted to witness such an individual in person.

In the parking lot, potentially hundreds of vehicles were being shown. Most are the hottest and most extraordinary vehicles to grace District 9.  It was for sure that these vehicles belonged to extremely wealthy individuals and/or people who spent their entire lives savings to own tech on wheels. Parking in the parking lot was not easy to come by. With such a behemoth known as the Ion Enforcer II, Mason __had__ to park on the side of the street. However, who would tow or tell him what to do? He was with the CCR!!!


[1/24/2025 6:54 PM] Aurora King
Aurora hopped out of the Ion Enforcer and flipped her hair, the breeze causing the ends of her hair to flow lazily in its currents. Then, taking the belt loops of her jeans, she would hike them up for optimal comfort. Glancing around at all the vehicles, her eyes were wide with surprise. **"Oh, these wheels are sick."**


[1/24/2025 7:31 PM] Mason Reed
*Mason opened the Enforcers door while turning the car off, then hopped out of it. He made his way over to Aurora's side before noticing she had been looking at a car—and even complimented it?! This prompted him to look as well. What could possibly catch her attention if not his own Ion Enforcer?!?!?!?*


[1/24/2025 7:48 PM] Narration
Aurora’s gaze locked onto the sleek beast of a vehicle parked just a few feet away. Its angular panels shimmered in a metallic gold and black finish, looking like a predator ready to strike. The razor sharp headlights gleamed with a piercing neon blue, while the rear taillights curved like molten lava trailing a faint afterglow even at rest. The car sat low, its wide tires hugging the ground like it owned the streets. The rear exhaust was a monstrous centerpiece, almost daring anyone to challenge its speed.

[1/24/2025 7:48 PM] Aurora King
She immediately went to go look!


[1/24/2025 8:08 PM] Mason Reed
". . ." *Well, that kinda hurt. Mason crossed his arms and squinted at the car. Honestly, it didn't seem that there was anything wrong with it.*
-# "It is a nice looking car, I guess..."

*Mason muttered under his breath while walking up with Aurora, though he kept a good amount of distance just to watch over her.* "Does this tickle your fancy, Ms. King?"

**"I whip this in that one car game, and I boot up every once in a while."** She remarked, looking through the tinted windows to glance at the interior. **"It's a wicked-fast set of wheels. So, I'd say yah"** She then moved towards the front where the hood was. She had to keep micro-managing her hair for now instead of her hair flowing backwards, it was now going forward, throwing her locks into her face.

"Mm..." *Mason only silently nodded while she talked. **There was the urge to compare the specs of a skinny ass sports car to a government issued monster truck,** but yah. Nice hot wheels.*

"Make sure not to get to close or touchy with the car, the owner might be a psychopath..." *He said jokingly while walking up closer to her. He assisted her with managing her hair as the wind kept blowing.*


[1/24/2025 8:37 PM] Aurora King
**"Probably a hyper weirdo too. Anyone with these wheels would have fried their decks. Thanks, Mason."** Referring to his subtle gestures of assistance. **"I should have grabbed a hair-tie before leaving the apartment."**


[1/24/2025 8:54 PM] Mason Reed
"I might have something in the truck you can tie your hair with, if it's really bothering you." *He took a few glances around the venue.* "..Where's that meet and greet supposed to be happening again?"


[1/24/2025 8:56 PM] Aurora King
**"Oh, I might have a tie lying around in your truck now that you metnion it.. The venue though is way over there."** She'd point towards the building in question. **"But, they can wait. Not going to just flake on ya just to pretend to like meeting people.."**


[1/24/2025 9:17 PM] Mason Reed
"Ha, I wonder how they'd react to the sweet behind the scenes Aurora, compared to the vixen they see on the screen. Are there any fans you genuinely like, though?"


[1/24/2025 9:18 PM] Aurora King
**"No. They are all weird."** She responded quickly!


[1/24/2025 9:38 PM] Mason Reed
"Oof.." *Even Mason felt bad for them. How he managed to catch a bag like her was still beyond him it seemed.* "Well, let's get your hair tie and then we can check out the car show and the streamer event. Which comes first doesn't really matter to me."

Mason and Aurora made their way back to the Ion Enforcer to retrieve a hair tie.


[1/24/2025 9:48 PM] Aurora King
Aurora rummaged through the small compartments and storage bins, finally fishing out a simple black elastic band tucked in one of Mason's gear organizers. She stood by the passenger-side door, quickly tying her hair back into a loose ponytail. **"Finally, no more wind torture,"** she quipped, brushing a few stray strands from her face.


[1/24/2025 10:22 PM] Mason Reed
"The struggles of having long hair, huh. And I was going to ask you if you could keep growing it out."


[1/25/2025 7:07 PM] Aurora King
**"This is as long as I will keep it."** Closing the door to the Enforcer, she began walking through the lot.


[1/25/2025 7:07 PM] Narration
Together, they strolled back into the sea of exotic vehicles, weaving through a maze of aerodynamic shapes, gleaming metallic finishes, and intricate tech upgrades. Each car they passed was a masterpiece in its own right—hovering concepts, road warriors, and experimental designs that blurred the line between machinery and art. The air hummed faintly with the energy of these technological marvels, each car promising unmatched speed, cutting-edge AI, or power beyond belief.


[1/25/2025 7:07 PM] Aurora King
Aurora's eyes darted from one vehicle to the next, her fingers itching to run along the sharp edges and smooth curves of some of the most enticing rides.


[1/27/2025 8:05 PM] Mason Reed
*Mason took the time to admire each vehicle they came by. Instead of skimming by them he looked like he was admiring each trait the cars had before moving on to the next. He didn't say much either because of how locked in he was, but it was clear by his expressions that he was really enjoying himself.*


[1/27/2025 8:17 PM] Narration
The couple was reaching the far end of the parking lot. Having exhausted most of their viewing options. When examining the last vehicle on the lot, Aurora turned towards Mason and asked an idle question.


[1/27/2025 8:17 PM] Aurora King
**"When do you think I'd get my turn behind the wheel of your 'baby'?"** She'd inquiry, placing her hands on her waist. **"Think I could handle it?"**


[1/27/2025 8:29 PM] Mason Reed
" 👁️ 👄 👁️ " *Yeah, he immediately froze up from that question.* "I don't think the streets could handle it to be honest... What type of vehicles do you know how to drive again?"


[1/27/2025 8:38 PM] Aurora King
She shrugged, **"Anything that doesn't scream deckin' loser. "**


[1/27/2025 8:47 PM] Mason Reed
"Hmm.. I see." *For now, she didn't have the spirit to drive an Ion Enforcer...* "Once we're in an open field away from buildings and people I'll let you drive it *a little*. Though, I'd recommend you driving something more beginner friendly first."


[1/27/2025 8:59 PM] Aurora King
**"Yeah? Like what?"**


[1/27/2025 9:31 PM] Mason Reed
*Mason thought for a moment before it looked like he came up with the perfect car.* "How about the Ingert Viper, IV for short. Ingert is known for their flexible sports cars for both casual and expert drivers. They value style and practicality, sounds perfect right?"

**"Oooh... I like what that might entail..."** She said smugly. She then ran her index finger across his chest as she walked past him.

*As he said this he grabbed her hand and pulled her close to him, wrapping his arm around her waist. He'd also give her a quick, sharp ~~love tap~~ on the behind to encourage her to walk forward with him.*


[1/29/2025 10:54 PM] Aurora King
She'd gasp, before shooting him a look. **"Mason!"** She exclaimed, her mouth gapped for just a brief moment.

**"Not in public..."** She murmured, though not entirely against his possessive deeds.

The line to the conference was long and dysfunctional. It was nearly impossible to discern from the beginning to the end. Thankfully, Aurora had been here before and knew the way to go. She would simply begin walking past everyone.


[1/29/2025 11:32 PM] Mason Reed
*Mason would just follow Aurora through the crowd. Despite him being used to being around a large group of people, for some reason this time he felt tense.*


[1/30/2025 8:02 PM] Aurora King
The two bypassed all of the lines on their way to the front due to Aurora's credentials as an online personality. Many people in line were ecstatic to see her in the flesh.


[1/30/2025 8:02 PM] Narration
**"Aurora, we love you!"** One of the people in line would shout to garner her attention. 
**"Can you sign my cyberdeck?!"**     **"When will you play Cyberspace 34?!"**            **"Are you streaming later tonight?!"**       **"Oh my goodness! Isn't that who I think it is?"**                                **"No way, they didn't say she would be here!"**                                  **"Who's that guy with Aurora? Must be her editor or something.."**          **"Is she going to be on the panel tonight?! Hell yeah!!!"**

Their voices were nothing but background buzz to Aurora. Once inside, it became more tolerable. On the inside, it was like a convention. Many online personalities were in attendance. *NeonSpectre, Cipher, GliVortex, ByteRiot, SeraphChrome, Shadow.exe* Booths were set up with merch, toys, and everything. This 'convention' seems much larger than what Aurora advertised.


[1/30/2025 8:02 PM] Aurora King
She mentioned that she was going to support one other streamer. However, considering her reputation, it is questionable why she isn't having a section of the convention hall for herself. She did not seem bothered in the slightest as she continued to navigate through the crowds. Many recognized her and continued to make comments and remarks. But once more, these were nothing but buzzin'.


[1/30/2025 11:49 PM] Mason Reed
*Mason continued following Aurora through the noisy crowd. How she was able to effortlessly ignore all the people calling out for her kinda made Mason feel bad for the folks, but he couldn't really blame her. How'd she'd have the social battery for all these people would be insane in it's own right. But, through all that, he was filled with a sense of pride knowing his girl was this popular and had so many people supporting her. Though, he did have to keep his possessive side in check...*

**"Woah, check out the net on this one, Chooms! Got the AuraQueen in our presence."** It was Cipher, another online personality with the same space as Aurora. Sporting Neon green hair and a face shield-like cybernetic and pants that seriously too tight to be comfortable for the choomba. 

He spotted Aurora from his table and decided to engage in conversation. Rounding his little booth, he came to conversation distance. Stopping Aurora and Mason on their path, **"What brings one of the best Solar Knights netters here? Thought the con was too dull for someone like you."** He would fold his arms, awaiting a response.

The conference, was what anyone would have expected of it. Filled with desperate gigadorks that haven't heard the term employment in their lifetime. Aurora opt'ed to be apart of the crowd—not wanting to be the center of attention this time around which was a bit uncharactistic of her—but not unheard of.

The conference had a lot of the big names sitting at a large table, taking questions and answering them—including dropping some hints to future content that the content creators were looking to do in unison.

Throughout the entire conference, Aurora remained tentive—listening to their every word and making mental notes of she thought of them. This would go on for about an hour and a half and before they knew it, the conference was coming to a close. 

The pair would exit the conference building and spill back out into the parking lot. Many of the vehicles that were on display were either gone or in the process of leaving—signalling the end of these fleeting events.


[2/2/2025 11:22 PM] Aurora King
Aurora, noticing that the wind had died down, pulled her hair tie out of her hair and allowed her hair to fall—framing her face and her shoulders. **"I had a good time. Bullying Cipher really was a neon sign in all of this. Had it coming."** She reached the passenger side of the Ion Enforcer, looking back at her output.


[2/2/2025 11:57 PM] Mason Reed
"Yeah..." *Mason didn't know everything that happened within her line of work, but whoever that Cipher guy be must've been hated for some reason. Though, that didn't really matter as Mason has his own personal reason.* 

"Next time he calls you whore, I really will break that ridiculous mask off his face..." *He said while balling up his fist, but quickly regained his composure.* "Other than that, I hope you had a good time, dear." *Mason moved over to the passenger side, opened the door for her, and picked her up to plop her in the seat so she wouldn't have to crawl in again.*


[2/3/2025 5:11 PM] Aurora King
Being treated like a princess was something she adored from Mason. Though, this instance was *partially* one of them. She appreciated him being a gentleman and opening the door for her. But what was not expected to happen was Mason literally lifting her into the air and putting her in the seat, sparking what one would call—an 'attitude.' **"Oh my gawd, Mason."** She exasperated, eyes wide with surprise, engagement, and a hint of irritation? **"It's not that tall that I can't jack myself into this rig, you know?"** 

Which could be seen as amusing, considering how she jumped in and out of the vehicle at any instance where she was the certified passenger princess. Crossing her arms, Aurora would roll her eyes and sink into the seat. Perhaps pretending to be upset?


[2/3/2025 9:56 PM] Mason Reed
"Heh..." *Her little 'attitude' only made Mason emit a small smirk. These little things was another reason why Mason liked to get her a little flustered, so it was safe to say he was used to her getting like this.* "Lifting you up wasn't because I didn't think you could climb into this, y'know." 

*That sentence was followed by Mason going up to her level and giving her a peck on the lips.* "...I hope you didn't forget what I said you needed earlier today~" *He said in a low tone.*


[2/3/2025 10:21 PM] Aurora King
Aurora rolled her eyes, though the slight pink dusting her cheeks betrayed the effort to seem unfazed. **"Oh please, don’t front like you’re not just lookin' for an excuse to get your hands on me."** She huffed just as he began to pull away. Her face chased his but did not touch him.

Instead of refuting his remarks, her eyes flicked back to him with a teasing glint. **"And as for whatever it is you think I *'need'*—"** she smirked, drawing out the last word. **"You’re gonna have to remind me, because I have no idea what you’re talking about."**

She leaned in just close enough to tempt him but not sufficient to close the distance, waiting to see if that was enough for him to get the damn truck in motion so they could get home already.


[2/3/2025 11:07 PM] Mason Reed
". . ." *That last sentence was all it took for Mason's composure to hit a nose dive.* "You asked for it, so I guess I'll have to deliver—!" *With probably the most haste she's seen Mason move, he closed the passenger's door and immediately went over to the drivers side, turning on the car. Needless to say, the will to become a F1 professional driver awakened within Mason as he drove home that night.*

Mason steered his vehicle into the station's lot just as the sun reached its apex. The scene that greeted him was both understated and frenetic, a startling scene of calm and disorder. Forensics specialists and investigative units from their station, as well as neighboring jurisdictions, buzzed around the area like a swarm of restless insects, each individual engrossed in their urgent tasks.

Bright, holographic caution stripes coiled around every available fence and post, marking the secured perimeter of the crime scene. The teams worked tirelessly, their expressions a mix of concentration and urgency, piecing together the fragmented clues left behind by the violent attack that had shattered the night before. The faint whir of drones hovered overhead, capturing aerial footage, while scattered tools and evidence bags lay strewn across the ground, testifying to the chaos that had unfolded just hours prior.

Mason could see blood trailing from one of the man doors coming from the vehicle bay. All the bay doors were open and there were even more agents within. Guess pulling his vehicle into the bay was not an option at the time being.


[3/3/2025 9:10 PM] Mason Reed
*As Mason drove around the lot he took in the chaotic sight before him. Seemed like it really was critical like Bailey said, not like he didn't believe her. Seeing as the bay wasn't open at the time he decided to park somewhere else near by. While driving he also looked around to see if Rob or Aurora's dad was around.*


[3/3/2025 9:22 PM] Narration
As Mason drove around, neither of them were in sight. He would perhaps go inside the station. Just, not through the vehicle bay.


[3/3/2025 11:19 PM] Mason Reed
"Not out here..." *Mason said to himself as he parked his truck. He hurriedly exited the vehicle and made his way to the main entrance.*


[3/4/2025 9:34 PM] Narration
Upon entering the station, he was greeted by the familiar detective who was waiting by the entrance for Mason to show up.


[3/4/2025 9:34 PM] Lt. Heather Bailey
**"About time you showed up. Any longer and I would have had to... Forget it."** She said, shaking her head. She was resting against the front counter of the receptionist desk. After she shook her head in disbelief, she straighted her posture. **"Hopefully, Commander King's mood doesn't worsen by the time we get back there."**

"Sorry, sorry.." *He said as he walked up to her. His rushed tone made it clear he’d really been in a hurry to get here.* "I'm with you there, this was the last thing that I expected to be happening, so..." *He sighed and shook his head while beginning to walk.* "Let's just meet up with him, I already used up enough time."


[3/4/2025 10:45 PM] Narration
The two briskly made their way through the halls. Many of the glass walls that decorated the office were shattered or downright destroyed. Though, the janitoral crew did a fantastic job cleaning up a great deal of the carnage overnight. Heather walked with Mason without much of a word, normally, she would ask simple question like 'how has your day been?'... Anything other than silently walking alongside him. Her eyes were glued on the path ahead of them.


[3/4/2025 11:02 PM] Mason Reed
*Mason was the same way. He usually tried to keep his mood and energy up during work, but this time...well, there was no need to explain why he felt different. Still, he knew he couldn't afford to sulk, especially not now. After a moment, he finally spoke up to break the silence. Perhaps to keep his mind from falling into a place he didn't want it to.*

"...How're you feeling? Anything you want to get off your chest before we meet the Commander?"


[3/4/2025 11:08 PM] Lt. Heather Bailey
**"Being promoted to Lieutenant was not in my plan. Now, I have to work to salvage the pieces left by idiots... Frankly, I would say I am doing better than usual."** Sarcasim seeped through her teeth.


[3/4/2025 11:41 PM] Mason Reed
"Huh..?" *He slightly turned to her.* "You got promoted to Lieutenant, when did that happen? " *He then looked forward, letting the pieces fall together for a moment.* "...Oh, I think I understand. Which one died?"


[3/4/2025 11:44 PM] Lt. Heather Bailey
**"Hilton."**


[3/5/2025 12:55 AM] Mason Reed
"**John?!**" *That was a shock—not exactly good or bad news, just...wow.*

`"Huh, I just saw that guy two days ago. Never really knew what he was up to with the CCR or what his ultimate goal was, but I guess that’s one less blight for this station."` *He let the thought settle for a moment before letting out a whistle.*

"Makes sense why they promoted you to Lieutenant right away, but I get that it’s not exactly fair to have it thrown on you like that."


[3/5/2025 2:42 PM] Lt. Heather Bailey
Heather murmured something just before they reached the commander's office. The semitranslucent glass outlined the silhouette of the commander, who sat motionless at the far end of the room. Heather pressed her thumb against the access control scanner. The red light that signified its state flashed green, and the sound of the strike disengaging clicked in their minds. She would then slide the door open, gesturing for Mason to enter first.


[3/6/2025 11:30 PM] Mason Reed
*Mason gave Heather a nod before stepping into the room. With each step, his mind raced, the tension building as he drew closer to facing Aurora's father. He already had a sense of what the conversation would involve, but the uncertainty of where it might lead kept him on edge. Still, he maintained his composure and waited for Heather to join him in the room, waiting for their Commander to acknowledge their presence.*


[3/7/2025 6:40 PM] Commander King
Commander King sat at the far end of his spacious office, which was large enough to accommodate a conference table and eight chairs comfortably, leaving ample space before his desk at the opposite end. He was positioned at the conference table closest to his personal desk, his eyes focused on a holographic screen projected in front of him. His fingers danced rhythmically over the holographic keyboard displayed on the cool, dark wooden surface of the table. For a brief moment, he glanced up to acknowledge Mason, his would-be son-in-law, along with Heather who followed closely behind him, before returning to his current task.

**"You're late, Mason. I expected you to be far more punctual."** The commander's voice filled the room with a warm brass that has rarely seen itself rise beyond a conversational level. It was a dominant trait of the Commander, A collected demeanor that never cracked even under the harshest conditions; this would be one of them.


[3/7/2025 10:08 PM] Mason Reed
*Mason's gaze drifted across the spacious office, taking in its imposing size and carefully arranged furnishings. He wasn’t a frequent visitor here, nor did he often find himself in the presence of Commander King. His attention lingered on the holographic screen before the man, curiosity tugging at him to catch a glimpse of whatever held the commander's focus. The rhythmic tapping of fingers against the projected keyboard filled the quiet space until it suddenly stopped. Only then did Mason shift his gaze fully to the man before him. As their eyes met, a familiar weight settled in his chest—an unshakable reminder that he was standing face to face with **__this man.__***

*As if a lump in his throat was forcefully taken out, he finally spoke.* "Forgive me, Commander." *He was about to speak again with the usual 'I was held up with something', but he knew it wasn't the time for that, given...their relationship. So, he stayed silent awaiting his next words.*


[3/7/2025 10:47 PM] Lt. Heather Bailey
Heather closed the door behind herself, filtering into the room and taking a seat somewhere relative to the center of the conference table. **"Well, I guess now is a good time as any to start with why you're here in the first place."** Heather started off with, double tapping on the conference table, a holographic display emerged before her. With the display now availabe to Heather, she navigated between a few menus before her projection was mirrored to the much larger display located at the center of the table. 

**"Last night, the station was attacked by the terrorist organization, 'Horizon Grey'. It was a simple yet disgustingly elegant attack."** She would press down on the conference table and it provided the similar clip he saw in the apartment. **"These insurgents managed to acquire one of our vehicles to bypass security access control leading to the vehicle bay. She would take her hands and zoom in on the image.


**"Four individuals were involved in the attack and we positively identified three of them. One of which happens to be Cole Mercer, we have been conducting raids on his properties and as we all know, happened to not be at the place you were dispatched to."**


[3/7/2025 10:47 PM] Commander King
The commander's eyes flicked upwards towards the holographic display in the center, now paying attention to Heather's briefing.


[3/7/2025 10:54 PM] Lt. Heather Bailey
**"The black man with the dreads is the notorious leader of Horizon Grey, Mathias Wildborne. It was stated through our channels that he was dead years ago, but apparently someone allowed them to live... A curious development which is currently being investigated by High command."** Heather would adjust the focus on Paige. 

**"This woman is Paige Underwood, equally a problem as Mathias Wildborne, but in her own right. She is wanted for mass genicide in D11."**

**"Last, but not least is their netrunner, who we've yet to identify due to her ability obfuscate her appearance to CCTV. That person is responsible for DDoSing our net, preventing most communications from going out and locking nearly everyone in."**


[3/7/2025 10:54 PM] Commander King
**"You're doing a fantastic job, Heather. But, Mason isn't one of your detectives. Please, tell Mason __why__ he is here."** He cut into Heather's explaination.


[3/7/2025 10:56 PM] Lt. Heather Bailey
**"..."** Heather shot a sideways glance towards Commander King, but left it at a mere glance. **"Of course."** Heather then redirected her attention towards Mason. **"My sergeant position opened since I took over as the station Lieutenant. That means, I have the authority to select who would take my place. Between you and other canidates, I decided it would be you who receive the promotion."**

[3/7/2025 11:43 PM] Mason Reed
*Mason pauses for a moment, taking in the information provided by Heather. Well, majority of the information he knew because of watching the news this morning, but it was still appreciated. His mind then shifted gears once more when she mentioned her role being open, and for him to fill it. For a second his mind went blank—the idea of him getting promoted from this didn't really occur to him, so he wasn't sure how to respond.*

"...I'm assuming with this promotion also comes an order?" *He asks plainly.*


[3/8/2025 12:00 AM] Lt. Heather Bailey
**"Yes."** Her tone was sharp, cutting straight to the point. No hesitation. **"Dylan, our dispatcher, was abducted during the raid. Another officer—gone, vanished in the chaos. We need more hands on this, but in different areas."** She let that sink in, giving just enough pause for the implications to settle before continuing.

Heather cleared her throat, straightening as she measured her next words carefully. There was a tension in the way she spoke, something deliberate—like she was leading up to a blow that couldn’t be softened.

**"I’m heading the investigation into the attack…"** she stated, voice steady but carrying the weight of responsibility. **"But what we need now is to figure out where they’re getting their information. And we’ve been following a person of interest for some time and we __need__ you to handle it."**


[3/8/2025 12:34 AM] Mason Reed
"..." *For a moment, his vision blurred from hearing Dylan's situation.* `"She's been abducted..."` *As she was letting her previous words sink in, mason let out a simple sigh of relief out of his nose.* `"She's not dead..good..."` *Not like being abducted was any good either, but better than her being dead.*

*He continued listening to Heather. His body feeling more tense as she continued to go on.* "Who is this person..?" *There was more he wanted to ask, but he figured he should start off with that question.*


[3/8/2025 3:59 PM] Lt. Heather Bailey
Heather exhaled slowly, the air slipping from her lips like a soft whisper. Her expression remained impassive, a calm facade concealing the storm of emotions within her, as she locked eyes with Mason.


[3/8/2025 3:59 PM] Commander King
The commander keenly watched Mason's expression shift as Heather dramatically unveiled the suspect they had been probing.


[3/8/2025 3:59 PM] Lt. Heather Bailey
Heather opened her mouth.


[3/8/2025 3:59 PM] Narration
Cue the electronic boom sound effect... **"..The suspect you will be investigating will be none other than __Aurora__."**

Erm what the sigma


[3/10/2025 12:00 AM] Mason Reed
". . ." *For a moment it felt as if time stood still, the words of Heather replaying in Masons head over and over. Did she say the right person? A ticklish sensation resided in his chest, almost like he wanted to laugh at the idea that what he heard was right. But, that feeling quickly went away once he recalled something.* `"..That's right, she knew about the factory incident right after it happened."`

*How she was able to find out about that, he still didn't know, nor did she specify. Either way, she must've gotten it from someone or through a method she alone had.* `"But why be an informant for a group like them...what's the motive? What actions could have hinted at this..?"` *It was then his eyes landed on Commander King. She never really did like her parents. Though, would she go to such extremes just to get back at them?*

-# "Oh..."
*Something clicked, or rather a few of the pieces that could've hinted at this came to mind.* `"She was acting weird the morning after I came home, but..."` *Before his mind could wander any further he cut off his thought process. Assuming too much just from this request wasn't good, but he still kept certain possible theories in the back of his head.*

*What felt like an eternity in Masons head was just a few seconds for them, and after a sigh he spoke.* "**How..How did you all come to that conclusion?**"


[3/10/2025 12:27 AM] Lt. Heather Bailey
Heather took a moment to gather herself. Her voice was clear, methodical, laying out facts with percision. **"At first, we had no reason to suspect Aurora had any involvement with Horizon Grey or their affiliates."** Heather began carefully, her gaze steady on Mason, reading his reactions closely. **"But recently, a neighboring precinct executed a warrant on an individual—someone who was notably one of Aurora's most devoted fans."**

Heather paused, allowing that detail to resonate before continuing. **"This fan wasn't simply enthusiastic; they were involved in selling classified corpo information to black markets. While searching their residence and digital records, Aurora's name repeatedly surfaced in their contacts."**

She leaned slightly foward, emphasizing the gravity of what she was sharing. **"We collaborated closely with the corporate entity overseeing our district's communication networks. Their specialists decrypted several exchanges between Aurora and this individual. The content was clear—anti-government sentiments, alongside supiciously timed pieces of intelligence."**

Heather sighed, her tone sharpening as she moved to the heart of the matter. **"We've had surveillance in place for months. A discreet camera set up outside your apartment provided insight into Aurora's activities. What we uncovered was troubling—a netrunner consistently managed to obscure their identity whenever they visited the complex."**


[3/10/2025 12:27 AM] Lt. Heather Bailey
**"This visitor showed up exclusively when you were away for work. The pattern has persisted for about a year now. Whoever this is, Aurora has deliberately hidden their identity and their visits from __you__."**

Heather showed footage of the camera being placed across the street from their apartment, the set of windows that belong to Aurora and Mason's apartment were also in frame. It was dark, suggesting this occured at night. A few frames later and a pixelated individual walked up towards the door.

Heather scrubbed a few minutes later in the footage and the light in Aurora's apartment turned on.

**"Aurora's digitial footprint is meticulously secured, making it extremely difficult to trace any clear wrongdoing. We suspect she either scrubs any incriminating data prior to your return or maintains physical records to prevent potential digital leaks. Regardless, she's covering her tracks exceptionally well."**

Heather paused again, **"If Aurora truly is orchestrating the distribution of information, there's a strong possibility that the intel she's passing along has been sold to Horizon Grey. That would give them the attack vectors they needed—possibly including the recent assault on our own station."**


[3/10/2025 1:34 AM] Mason Reed
"**Hm.**" *It was clear that beneath Masons exterior he was seething for too many reasons to boil down. He lowered his head and furrowed his brows while pinching the bridge of his nose. He wanted to say ALOT, but he couldn't think of a way to say it that wouldn't sound, well, **damning.** All of the piece's that he thought of came to light.* 

*How and where would she get that information—from that army of hers of course. If she wanted anything those people would supply her with it immediately. But why would she even go to someone like that? How would did they even formally meet? And the most nagging question was **__who__** was it. She always acted indifferent when talking about her fans, or was that just another deception as well?*

*Mason's left fist balled up, any tighter and his nails might dig into his skin completely. Yep, it was completely obvious how he was feeling no matter how hard he was trying to hide it before.* `"Aurora, Aurora, Aurora..."` 

*A feeling he could only call disgusting began to well up within him. Out of all the questions he would want to ask her it would be 'why?' None of this seems rational, unless her hate for her fathers work went this deep. Actually, he should've suspected something as soon as she gave him that speech about her wanting him to leave the CCR. No, he already knew that was a sign from the start, he just decided to brush it under the rug like he always does with Aurora's usual behavior.*

*Despite how many gaps he tried to see in Heathers explanation he couldn't fully justify her actions. 'She might've just been chatting?', 'What if the fan was the one giving information, not her?'* "**. . .**"

# Why?
*If he could say anything it would be that simple word. All this just felt unnecessary, so why would she do this? Wasn't she the one that wanted to get away from crap like this, so why is she the one in the middle of it? Mason seemed motionless. Honestly, if he moved he was scared he might hit and break something, but he

removed his hand from his nose and returned to his usual posture.*

*His face looked... grim. Like he really despised simply being in the same room with..anyone at the moment. Despite how he was feeling, though, he finally spoke.* "**So what?**" *His voice came out flat, but the tension in his body told a different story. He exhaled sharply, before speaking again. *"**You think because I’m me, I can handle this? That I can just—**"

*He stopped himself, jaw tightening. His thoughts were moving too fast, colliding, unraveling. A bitter scoff left him—short, humorless.*

"**What exactly is your plan here, Heather? You lay all this at my feet and then what?**" *His eyes finally met hers, colder than before.* "**You want me to fix it? You want me to confront her? Turn her in? Leave then spy on her, wait for that little 'fan' of hers to come back and flatline him?**"

*His lips parted slightly, as if he had more to say, but he stopped himself again. His fist clenched. He let out a slow, controlled breath before his final words came lower.*

"**Tell me what you expect me to do with this. Because right now, I can’t see a single option that doesn’t make me go overboard and hate myself.**"

[3/10/2025 1:59 AM] Commander King
King’s voice took over. **"I want you to get her out of this mess."** Her father stood up slowly, commanding their attention. **"My relationship with my daughter is distant, but, that is not enough for me to abandon her and throw her away."**

The commander’s gaze remained locked on Mason’s **"I have every reason to believe that she is not doing this on her own volition. But is being manipulated by someone who is taking advantage of our strained relationship."**

He took pause to let the man across from him to process the information. **"You are her partner and it would do neither of us any favors to have her arrested or to lash out. It would only drive her away further than she is already."**

Pointing to the still image of the blurred netrunner. **"We need to know who we are dealing with so we can better protect Aurora. Otherwise we’ll be working against ourselves. We must approach this tactfully. Do you understand what I am trying to convey, Mason?"**


[3/11/2025 6:41 PM] Mason Reed
*The heavy burden of emotions pressing down on Mason suddenly felt lighter. Perhaps this was the reassurance he needed. As Aurora's partner, this could have been the worst mission for him, if not for Commander King's sense of reason. He let out an audible sigh of relief, trying to suppress the whirlwind of emotions he had felt just moments ago.* 

"**Yes, I understand.**" *He nodded in response to his words, his expression lightening slightly, carrying the desperate look of a silent "thank you."*

ok maybe mason is the goat


[3/11/2025 8:30 PM] Commander King
King glanced over towards Heather and then back to Mason. **"Here is my plan."** He sat back down slowly. Waiting until he fully reseated himself, King would continue with his plan. 

**"You will have to decieve Aurora. Your vacation has came to a close and you're back on the beat. Give her space, but monitor this space. Cameras, microphones, whatever you need to garner information."**

Tapping a digital pen on the table, King would glance over towards Heather. **"I need to you get Mason __anything__ he needs to see this through. Any lawman he chooses, equipment, schedule them, procure them."** Then, King returned his gaze upon Mason. **"Your task begins now, the question is, what is it you need today to start?"**


[3/15/2025 12:07 AM] Mason Reed
*What would he need? That's a hard question, seeing as he doesn't really want to deceive or spy on Aurora himself, but at this point he doesn't really have a choice. He needs to get Aurora out of his weird situation, and figure out who that "fan" is. He already had some plans in mind, however, he only needs to see how well they'd work in action.*

"**What I need...**" *There was a pause as he looked to the side.* "**Considering that this 'fan' can disrupt their face on camera I'm assuming that'll be out of the running. An audio recorder might be a good start to catch their live conversations...**" *There was an obvious hint of hesitation in his voice.* "**...Do you two have any ideas or suggestions?**"


[3/15/2025 10:52 PM] Lt. Heather Bailey
Heather glanced over towards King for a brief second before inhaling and facing Mason. **"How I would approach this would be to bug the apartment. Go in, tell her you'll be working for a while and stash a recorder while her back's turn."**

She sat back in her seat. **"We did not want to risk alerting her to our investigation and getting too close, so we only had video posted across the street."**. Heather blinked, sending Mason the address. **"Sent you the address of the room we used for surveillance. The equipment is all still there."**


[3/16/2025 2:02 AM] Mason Reed
"**Then we had the same idea.**" *While saying that Mason checked the address Heather had sent him. With that room, the equipment, and personnel at his disposable all he has to do is make take the right steps during the right moments..*

"**Thanks,**" *He said to Heather regarding the address.* "**I think I have an idea on how to go forward with this case.**" *Despite how he felt, he continued to push his words out.*


[3/16/2025 2:02 AM] Lt. Heather Bailey
**"We are more than eager to hear it... Or if you wish to just get started, we won't hold you."** Heather added.


[3/16/2025 2:04 AM] Lt. Heather Bailey
**"Again, as Commander King has said. Ask for anything and you'll receive... If reasonable."**


[3/16/2025 2:29 AM] Mason Reed
*He gave them both a nod and began to turn away, but stopped mid-step.* "**...**" *It was clear he had something on the tip of his tongue, but after a brief hesitation, he shook his head and continued toward the door. A sharp pain flickered through his nerves. This wasn’t something a mission he ever wanted to do, and even dreaded it, but with Aurora being Aurora, maybe it was bound to happen eventually in some capacity. He had noticed odd behavior from her before, sure, but that alone didn’t make her untrustworthy...or capable of something truly unforgivable.*

*That familiar hollow feeling crept back into his chest, but he shoved it aside. It’s fine. Just another barrier between them—something he’d get over, no problem. And maybe, just maybe, it was finally time to confront some of Aurora’s more troubling tendencies while also dealing with that "pest".*


[3/21/2025 11:06 PM] Narration
Mason exited the commander's office and back out into the hallway where one of the staffers that works within the building nearly ran into him. Luckily, she side-stepped Mason and continued on her way in one smooth motion. **"Excuse me."** She says curtly before vanishing around the corner of the hallway.

Mason should make his way towards the special equipment storage. There, he would find the audio recording devices.


[3/22/2025 12:06 AM] Mason Reed
"**Hm..**" *Mason eyed at the work for a moment before putting the moment in the back of his head. If he got ran into, well, at the moment that didn't really matter to him. He continued on his way and made for the storage room, where he would pick up a few handfuls of the recording devices. He thought to pick up a few more tools just in case, but what..? Before he thought cameras would be ineffective—at least to the fan, but just in case he would also pick up some small planting cameras.*
