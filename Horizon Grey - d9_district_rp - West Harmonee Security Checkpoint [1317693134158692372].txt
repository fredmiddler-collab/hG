[12/14/2024 11:28 PM] Narration
Kaedues emerged from the illuminated underground tunnel into the shadow of the colossal walls that separate District 9 from the rest of the world. Large amounts of aerial vehicles moved in and out of Monita and towards their destinations. There was an extremely militaristic checkpoint ahead, which was manned by armed guards and equipped with surveillance equipment. As Kaedues pulled behind the vehicle in front of him he saw six individuals approaching the car from the front. These weren't the lawmen that Kaedues had grown accustomed to seeing. They wore sleek, black uniforms with no visible insignia, and their faces were obscured by reflective visors that gave them an imposing, anonymous presence. Each carried a compact, high-tech pulse and smart rifles slung across their chests, and their movements were synchronized; rigorous training. These were soldiers... military through and through.

Soon after the driver and the soldier made contact, the soldier began ripping the poor man out of his car and beating him mercilessly. In the meantime, the other soldiers had opened the vehicle's doors. Performing a comprehensive search of the car, throwing the contents haphazardly across the street. There were two soldiers near the rear of the vehicle, watching Kaedues through their opaque visors. Kaedues could see the driver being brutalized through the spaces in their limbs.

Pretty soon, He'll be next in line.

*It's a really, really good thing he has good reason to be here.*

*Kaedues gives each of the guards obscuring the view an expressionless look before looking straight ahead again. Sucks for that guy. Not like Kaedues hasn't seen similar shit in Haven Heights before.*

*He removes the flash drive from his neck. The music cuts out.*

The soldier wreaking havoc on the driver dragged the guy off to the side. A thick trail of blood followed as he was pulled. In another instance, one of them climbed into the driver's seat and parked the vehicle on a side street. Now, he was being signaled to take the spot of the previous car.

*Kaedues pulls forward. He breathes in and out and waits for instruction on behalf of the military working there.*


[12/15/2024 12:15 AM] Narration
The moment Kaedues reached the designated spot. The van's back doors were ripped open and two soldiers climbed into the back and searched it. The soldier at his window paused to look at Kaedues'. His visor illuminated as it wirelessly processed Kaedues's information. The visor interface went green and his visor rose, revealing his cybernetic eyes. From what Kaedues could see, his entire head was one tangled mesh of cybernetics. **"Kaedues Staub, state your purpose entering Monita."** He said in a robotic tone.


[12/15/2024 12:19 AM] Kaedues Staub
*Kaedues doesn't hesitate.* **"I am here to help stockpile goods."** *Any more than that and Kaedues would risk answering more questions than he was asked.*


[12/15/2024 1:58 AM] Narration
**"Anything in the vehicle or on your person that would constitute as contraband?"** Was his next question.


[12/15/2024 2:50 PM] Kaedues Staub
*(That's an interesting way to phrase the question,)* *Kaedues thinks to himself.*

**"Not that I know of. Hold.."** *Kaedues says. He moves his hand to pat down his chest, then lower torso.* **"I am going to check my pockets. I am not armed,"** *He continues, his arms moving slightly. Outside of the view of the cyborg, Kaedues pushes his hand into his side pocket where Grace's chip drive is. Whether or not footage of Freddie Dawson is contraband is not a question he wants to have answered right now.*

*He feels around his pocket, very briefly for something smooth, with-- there. A piece of scotch tape, patching a hole and holding together the aged fabric of Kaedues' jumpsuit. He removes the tape and pushes the chip drive through. While the drive falls through his pant leg and into his right shoe, he raises his eyebrow and reaches behind him, into his back pocket.*

**"I do have weapon manufacturing blueprints on me."** *Kaedues pulls the paper out of his back pocket, unfolds it, and shows it to the man outside the window.*
*(He might take this from me in even some of the best case scenarios. Giving him something instead of nothing may dissuade him from strip searching me though.. especially since I can think of a good reason why I have these papers.)*


[12/15/2024 6:20 PM] Narration
The soldier did not respond to Kaedues' reply. Instead, he opted for a quick glance at the blueprint before viewing the interior of Kaedeus' vehicle from the window. It seemed like Kaedues' explanation pacified him just enough to move towards the back of the vehicle.  

 In the back, the soldiers could not find anything out of the ordinary. Even going so far as to remove interior panels that looked altered to find nothing of interest. Several minutes of searching passed before that same soldier came back to Kaedues' window and gestured to him to pull forward. **"Proceed to the gate."** He instructed.


[12/15/2024 6:57 PM] Kaedues Staub
*Kaedues pulls the van up to the gate at a steady speed. No need to complicate things.*

Upon reaching the gate, a large led screen would flash a symbol of a hand with an open palm, as a sign to Kaedues that he should stop and exit the vehicle. In addition to the screen, there was an obscenely loud buzzer accompanying it. Two sleek, black security drones hovered down from above, their rotors barely making a sound over the blaring buzzer. Equipped with high-resolution cameras and infrared sensors, they meticulously scanned the vehicle's exterior. After completing their inspection, they emitted a soft beep, signaling that the vehicle was clear to proceed.

 The massive gates slowly parted, their heavy metal frames sliding smoothly along hidden tracks. A low rumble accompanied their movement, echoing across the compound. As the gap widened, Kaedues could see the sprawling complex beyond.

 The complex was a hive of activity, with citizens dressed in identical gray uniforms moving purposefully along designated paths. A large contingent of soldiers, clad in sleek armor and armed with advanced weaponry, maintained a watchful presence, ensuring order was upheld. Towering watchtowers loomed overhead, their searchlights sweeping across the area, adding to the atmosphere of stringent surveillance and control.

*The redhead proceeds forward beyond the gate after seeing the screen change to present a green symbol. He carefully navigates down the roads to the location Gavyn posted him. He notes the directional signs telling him where he can and cannot go.*

*(Seems simple enough. I'll stay inside the lines.)*

Beyond the immediate design of the area before him stood the massive walls that kept everyone within. The walls were towering and imposing, constructed from reinforced steel and advanced composite materials, their surfaces smooth yet unyielding. At intervals along the perimeter, automated turrets and surveillance cameras ensured that no unauthorized personnel could breach the perimeter. Above the walls, a large contingent of aerial vehicles buzzed in organized patterns, maneuvering seamlessly through the air. Dominating the sky, the Steel Titan, a massive military flagship, cast its shadow over the entire complex. Its hull glinted menacingly in the sunlight. Equipped with an array of advanced weaponry and defense systems, the Steel Titan served as both a symbol of power and a deterrent against any threats... Interesting.
