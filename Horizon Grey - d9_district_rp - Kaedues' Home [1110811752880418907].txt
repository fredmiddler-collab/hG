**"What?"** *Kaedues asks himself. He just... looks at himself.* **"......What?"**


[5/24/2023 2:15 AM] Kaedues Staub
*Kaedues is constantly having to police his own thoughts, which run amuck after such a confusing interaction. It only took a moment for him to question himself, acting as the door from his workaholic life to his closeted interior. He feels compelled to do, to be, but not knowing what. He looks at himself again in the mirror, seeing someone else entirely.*

*No, literally. Kaedues sees someone else. He sees not the man who walks into work, but a strange boy. Someone who appears much more competent at expressing himself than Kaedues does.*


[5/24/2023 2:18 AM] Kaedues Staub
*He blinks, but the mirage doesn't disappear. The more he looks at it, the harder it becomes to think coherently, as if he is accepting violent and archaic knowledge inside. He looks away to align his thoughts again. Think simply, think rationally. Think logically. That is all there is.*

*Rationally. Logically. Rationally. Logically.*
*When he looks back at the mirror, he sees the boy again, and his thoughts immediately derail. It's like a trigger, but he can't place the pin on that. This time he fails to break eye contact with his reflection.*

*Kaedues at some point considers the possibility he is delirious or tired... but his thoughts scramble when he sees the mirror. At this point, he is--at least momentarily-- lost to himself.*

*The corners of his vision fade to black slowly until a vignette completely forms around his vision. Then even that shrinks, creating a tunnel vision forward at the boy in the mirror. Red and purple lines appear across the vignette as his eyes try desperately to make out the real world Kaedues is beginning not to see anymore.*
*There's a dull pain in his chest, his lungs, but he's not sure why.*

`"They already know everything." The boy speaks. His mouth moves like a real person's would.`

**"---!!!"** *Kaedues steps backwards but fails to balance himself! He falls straight onto his ass, the blow only startling him more. The pain in his chest pounds away. There are no thoughts anymore, just whims. Just reflex. Just instinct.*
*Kaedues breathes in, and at this point realizes he was not breathing at all. The vignette he sees crawls away, into the back of his head like a parasite that had been injured while trying to take control.*


[5/24/2023 2:30 AM] Kaedues Staub
*Kaedues looks up at the mirror. From this angle, it shows nothing. It's a white piece of slate, reflecting the sunlight outside somewhere else. This scares Kaedues a little, not knowing what will be up there when he stands. He takes another breath.*

*But at the end of the day he knows he has to stand, and so he does. And looking into the mirror, he only sees himself.*
**"......"**

*He turns the faucet on and just allows the water to beat off his hands. Kaedues __feels__ the water. He takes another breath.*


[5/24/2023 2:39 AM] Kaedues Staub
*Kaedues looks off into the rest of his house. Suddenly, the room he was so complacent with looks empty. The colors he once accepted as reality appear to be drab. He feels a sudden distaste for things. Looking around, he suddenly feels boxed in where before he felt snug.*

**"What?"** *Kaedues keeps questioning the world around him, suddenly not understanding parts of it for no real.... __reason__. And why does that itch at him so much? Why does he need a __reason__? Like everything needs to fall into place....*

*He doesn't need that, he realizes. He doesn't want to live restricted.*


[5/24/2023 2:40 AM] Kaedues Staub
*Then, it disappears. The feeling of enlightment erases itself, and Kaedues scratches his head.* **"I haven't eaten yet today."** *Kaedues nods to himself before leaving without a second thought at all.*

[6/4/2023 11:34 PM] Narration
Not long after their conversation, albeit short, they arrived at Kaedues's abode. Danny had finished his call but did not go into details on what was discussed.


[6/4/2023 11:34 PM] Danny Donovan
**"...This is your place?" ** He asked looking around. This was not exactly the safest place.


[6/4/2023 11:40 PM] Kaedues Staub
**".....Yeah."** *Kaedues pauses for a moment.* **"Oh. I..."** *Kaedues sighs.* **"My bed was in the van. Guess I'll have to pull from savings."** *He says as he steps into the room. To Danny the room feels very cramped. However Kaedues just does not seem to notice or care.*

*Kaedues begins to look around for something to sleep on. The sink? The tub? The floor? He wonders which is best.*

[6/4/2023 11:50 PM] Danny Donovan
He would step in but only a little. His larger frame would not allow him to step any further in without knocking something over. **"....Damn Kaedues, you sure you don't need to crash at my place?"**


[6/4/2023 11:55 PM] Kaedues Staub
**"You don't need to offer anything like that, Danny. You already helped so much."** *As Kaedues says this, he takes out a garbage bag from a cabinet underneath his sink. He rips it open and spreads it over his sink and begins to __climb into it__. He's setting up a bed. In no world will the garbage bag make this any easier, either.*

**"I'll see you at work tomorrow. I'll have to walk so I might be a few minutes late."**

[6/5/2023 12:00 AM] Danny Donovan
**"Nope, not happening."** He was not going to have Kaedues sleep in the fucking sink for crying out loud. He would make is way in to his home. **"Come on, not accepting no as an answer."**


[6/5/2023 12:01 AM] Kaedues Staub
*Kaedues is now ass deep in the sink.* **"It's fine, really. I'll just get a new mattress tomorrow."** *Kaedues is actually protesting an offer to sleep somewhere more comfortable.*


[6/5/2023 12:05 AM] Danny Donovan
Danny would quite literally pick him up like a toddler, cupping his hands underneath Kaedues arms. and lifting him. **"Didn't ask."**


[6/5/2023 12:06 AM] Kaedues Staub
**"Okay."** *Kaedues isn't complaining. As long as he gets to go to work tomorrow.*


[6/5/2023 12:10 AM] Danny Donovan
Setting him down on the ground, he would see to it that Kaedues would truly follow through.


[6/5/2023 12:13 AM] Kaedues Staub
*Kaedues is true to his word, as small as it was. He follows Danny out of his house.*
*He locks the door on the way out. Don't know why you needed to. But Kaedues does lock it.*


[12/9/2024 9:20 PM] Narration
After 20 minutes of traversing through the cramped and crowded streets of Haven Heights. Danny and Kaedues arrived back at his house safe and sound.


[12/9/2024 9:20 PM] Danny Donovan
Shifting the vehicle into park, Danny let out an long drawn out sigh from his lungs. Coming down from the anxiety that plagued him the entire car ride here. **"Do you need money for a mattress, Kaedues? You should __really__ invest in one."** He suggested lightly. Still remembering the sink incident.


[12/9/2024 9:24 PM] Kaedues Staub
*Kaedues gets out of the car and walks into his house. He takes a moment to think before pivoting halfway towards Danny.*
**"Can I tell you something, Dan?"** *After asking, he makes the full turn to face the guy.*


[12/9/2024 9:24 PM] Danny Donovan
**"Anything buddy."** He responded near instantly. His full undivided attention now on Kaedues.


[12/9/2024 9:46 PM] Kaedues Staub
**"Fairview gives me the same kind of impression I get when I buy from the West-side dollar menu."** *Kaedues breathes in with his chest and then lets it all out.* **"I met people there. Even got a job done."** *Kaedues turns his head, looking out his dilapidated window. Only one of the panes is particularly clear.*

**"Seeing Haven Heights now feels like...."** *He pauses for a moment.*

*...The moment becomes a while...*

**"...Actually... nevermind,"** *He says. Kaedues looks over to his sink, the mirror above it. He closes his eyes and feels the cold air of the room around him.* **"You can't bring me with you."**

**"No one will 'bring me' anywhere. I am not an accomplice,"** *Kaedues says and turns to Danny again.* **"Where I go, I bring myself."**


[12/9/2024 9:58 PM] Danny Donovan
**"..."** In the face of the statements made by Kaedues, Danny was speechless. In spite of the fact that it was impactful, there was much room for consideration. It was difficult for him to make sense of what he might have been trying to convey since he wasn't from Haven Heights. But when Danny heard him say that he was not an *"accomplice"*, this really caught his attention. There is a wide range of meanings that could be associated with it. Nevertheless, what he perceived at the time was that it only had one. 

His lip was tugged slightly at the corner and there was a slight grin on his face. This was the Danny he was more accustomed to. His eyes softened and his posture finally became relaxed. **"Of course, Kaedues..."** With a simple flick of his wrist, Grace and Fred's contact details were forwarded to him. **"I'll keep in touch... Stay safe."**

With that, he shifted his car into drive and mindfully pulled away from the curb.

**"..."**

*(That.. was beneficial.)* *He steps outside and looks out at the street.*

*(Well.. No time like the present.)*
*Kaedues walks backwards into his house again and closes the door. In a moment, he pulls up Freddy's contact info and gives him a ring.*


[12/9/2024 10:11 PM] Narration
The line rang for some time... Perhaps Fred was not going to ans—


[12/9/2024 10:11 PM] Fred Dawson
`"Who is this, what do you want, and how did you get my number?"` Right to the point, awesome. Judging by the intonation in his voice. He isn't very pleased to be receiving scam calls.


[12/9/2024 10:14 PM] Kaedues Staub
**"Kaedues Staub. To introduce myself. Danny gave me your digits."** *He pauses to make sure all of that was received.* **"I'm the person who was with Danny when he visited Grace's hospital room."**


[12/9/2024 10:18 PM] Narration
There was a uncomfortable pause distancing the two.


[12/9/2024 10:18 PM] Fred Dawson
`"That's right, you're Danny's hooligan, great... In addition to the fact that it is beyond my comprehension why he gave you my number, you have still not explained what prompted your call. Unlike some people, I do not like wasting time on idle talk."`


[12/9/2024 10:31 PM] Kaedues Staub
**"If you need something done, something you can't be there for, call this number. I will do what I can."** *There's a brief pause from Kaedues' end.* **"Doubt my character. Don't doubt my experience,"** *Kaedues says before hanging up.*

*(He seems like the usual old fuck. If I'm right, he'd rather have had the last word. I hope it helps him remember the offer.)*

*He blinks and presses his fingers into his temple, ringing Gavyn's number. Here we go...*


[12/9/2024 10:36 PM] Narration
It rang _once_


[12/9/2024 10:36 PM] Gavyn
`Caliber guy-man? Caliber guy! Hey bud! I was just thinking about you just the other day. What's poppin' my Caliber guy... No, that sounded weird... my guy...?`

Kaedues could hear him say,
-# "fuck...."

**"It's been a hectic last... ...day. I need to get back into working order."** *He clears his throat.* **"Know anyone who has some wheels they could loan out, Gav? Even better if it's a van."**


[12/9/2024 10:42 PM] Gavyn
`Oh, how long would you need the wheels?` He inquired.


[12/9/2024 10:44 PM] Kaedues Staub
**"Until I can find a prosthetic hand."**


[12/9/2024 10:45 PM] Gavyn
`Whaa? What you need one of those things for? You're the fastest guy with his hands I've seen in my life!`


[12/9/2024 10:49 PM] Kaedues Staub
**"...Like I said, it's been a hectic day."** *A small pause from his end.* **"Freak accident on the road. Had to tear the thing off myself unless I wanted to be roasted golden brown."**


[12/9/2024 11:08 PM] Gavyn
`Shit man... I-I don't know what to say... That's shittier than west-side food... We have a van here that ain't being used.. Uh, but I'll need it back like, in a week? It runs, sorta. Have to jump it every so often, but other than that it drives.`


[12/9/2024 11:20 PM] Kaedues Staub
**"I'll have it back to you for whatever you need it for. If I still need it by that time.. i'll figure something out. Anyway, since you're lending it to me, I'll run you a few errands as thanks. Keep me posted, would you?"**


[12/9/2024 11:26 PM] Gavyn
`Sure thing bud... Swing by whenever. Preferably between 6AM and 7PM. We'll get you squared away.`


[12/9/2024 11:29 PM] Kaedues Staub
**"Not that I won't sprint over there, but.. I don't have a car to drive over there. Any way we can arrange a pick-up?"** *Kaedues asks as if he's pleading his case..*


[12/11/2024 7:26 PM] Gavyn
There was a pause for fraction of a second before he responded. `Work is slow due to the lockdown. Imports to the district have ceased and exports to Fairview are non-existent until they decide whatever they are looking for is found or whatever. I'll see if Carlos can swing by. I'll message you soon.`


[12/11/2024 7:36 PM] Kaedues Staub
**"Yeah, alright. Thanks a lot, Gavyn. I'll make sure you get repaid for this,"** *Kaedues says and hangs up.*

*He looks around his apartment. Apartment? Condo, house? Honestly, it's just a place he goes to shower..*
*Now, the man walks to his sink and gazes into the mirror above it again...*

*(It's just me.)*

[12/11/2024 7:43 PM] Kaedues Staub

*Kaedues fishes in his pockets and retrieves Grace's chip drive. Looking at it, it doesn't seem noteworthy. Why even bother taking it in the first place?*

*Anyway.. he pushes the drive into the slot in his neck and gives it a read.*

After Kaedues had inserted the chip, he was presented with a few menu items to choose from after inserting the chip. The files were videos, unencrypted and labeled only with dates, each serving as an individual identifier. No names, no code words—just dates.

*Kaedues' eyebrows furrow. Corrupted files? Not something he likes to see..*

*He takes a closer look, but isn't able to figure out why the files are corrupted. With no work to be done there of yet, he just takes a look at the first video-- 03/20/2262.*


[12/11/2024 9:26 PM] Narration
Kaedues' vision distorted as he plunged into the video...

The room was dark, with a single light source illuminating what appeared to be a still photograph. A violent movement of the view followed, followed by a return to the original focus. Grace was in frame, looking just above the viewport. In an examination of the camera in her hand, her eyes danced around. In the end, she was satisfied after a few minutes of this. 

As Grace stepped away from the camera, lighting in the room began to increase in intensity and soon the room was fully lit. This wasn't Shop 1113, but rather a bedroom with everything one might need. The background included a bed, a nightstand, and a shelf displaying awards from some university. It was unclear which university it was.

It was her school's uniform that she wore. The ensemble was colored brown and gold. She wore a tight-cuffed blazer with a pleated skirt that curved at the ankles. Her staple glasses weren't on... Has Kaedues ever seen her without her glasses? She seemed like she was straining too. Why would she not wear her glasses?

To the camera, she said, **"This is my engineering exit exam submission."**. A shy smile spread across her face as she regretted recording it in the first place. An object outside the frame caught her attention. A few nervous facial expressions appeared as a swallow and a hovering drone came into view. In front of the drone was an illuminated lens that displayed a diagram. 

**"My time here has been devoted to what I consider one of my greatest engineering accomplishments, the multi-layer spectroscopic analyzer."** It looked like an awkward handgun with a screen sitting on top, as if it were a handheld device.


[12/11/2024 9:27 PM] Narration
**"In 2257, Doctor Dawson and Jong Seung conducted pioneering research on absorption spectroscopy, which resulted in the use of spectroscopy for novel applications. By isolating radiation variants, we can detect different levels and kinds of radiation using machine learning and predict and display objects of interest beyond simple applications."**

A new screen was displayed by the drone. An image of a wall using a handheld device to locate objects behind it. **"This is a stud finder, an ancient yet effective device intended to find objects behind solid surfaces. It has many variants of itself. Vibration devices that create images based on the speed and length of waves, heat, and even X-rays can be used to capture medical images. However, with our advances in spectroscopy we can do more."**

Another slide, with the device she was using, this 'Multi-layer spectroscopic analyzer' showed things in color and went through a looping cycle of showing the wall, what was in the wall in color, what was behind that wall and beyond even inside a car that happened to be parked on the road on the other side of the wall. **"Since everything in our world has some sort of radiation, we can evaluate the object based on the values down to the atomic level. We can also evaluate the composition and transform it into data we can perceive."**

She talked to explain the science behind it. A CPU's composition, how it communicates, what phases it goes through in order to produce an image we can perceive, and the probability statistics it is using to predict what it perceives. She showed the device and even demonstrated it, showing the hallway of the complex she lived in. Room 53 was visible through the wall, indicating it was able to view the hallway. Across the street, UrbanFlex Inc. A company shop across the street.

He could watch it or switch files..


[12/11/2024 9:34 PM] Kaedues Staub
*Kaedues has nothing to do except take in this information. He __had__ never seen Grace without her glasses, and though the sight is odd he can't bring himself to question it too much.*

*(Why was this girl... making guns in Shop 1113?)*

*Kaedues keeps watching the video, intent to look through as much of the drive as he can.*


[12/11/2024 9:39 PM] Kaedues Staub
*His index finger and thumb rub together...*

-# ***". . .I had nothing better to do so here I am."***

*(... I feel like she said something like this to me. When, though..?)* *Thinking about it makes Kaedues' head hurt, and doesn't bring him any closer to a bigger picture.*


[12/11/2024 9:42 PM] Narration
The video continued with a closing note that seemed like a generic 'Do this at the end of your submission.' deal.

**"Having gained comprehensive knowledge and education, I intend to progress to the position of senior engineer in the government's environmental efficiency department and earn money. This will help me provide a better future for my brother... and family. I am grateful for this opportunity and look forward to making the most of it... Thank you."**

Video end......


[12/11/2024 9:45 PM] Kaedues Staub
*(Brother? Never knew.)*

*Kaedues is only more confused as to Grace's position in the weapon shop.*
*He switches the file to the second-- 04/02/2262.*


[12/11/2024 10:20 PM] Narration
The scene opened dimly, a faint flickering light casting erratic shadows against the walls. The faint hum of a drone hovered in the background, synchronizing with Grace’s soft, measured breathing. Grace's face emerged into the frame as she adjusted the camera, her eyes reflecting a weariness Kaedues hadn't seen. Her glasses perched haphazardly on her nose, smudged by frequent adjustments.

She shifted uncomfortably, brushing a loose strand of her brown hair behind her ear. The room was the same except it was a mess. Just like her work desk. **"This one’s a little more personal,"** she began, her voice unusually low, almost cautious. **"There's been a lot on my mind lately, especially with everything happening at home. I don't have anyone else but myself. I listen to my self talk more than anyone listens to me so..."**

She leaned closer to the camera, then backed away from it. She was too close anyways.

**"I’ve noticed things about my dad. Oftentimes, small things, like how he’s been so distant with my brother lately. It’s subtle, but it’s there. I’ve caught him looking at him like... like he’s someone else entirely. Not his son, not his family, but something... Other. Money is a problem, I know it is. It has always been as long as I remember... Despite my dad's job."**

Her hands fidgeted as she spoke, folding and unfolding a small piece of paper. **"And then there’s me. I’ve always been the 'good daughter,' the one who follows the rules, who excels. But lately, I feel like I’m drifting too. Like... I’m not sure who I’m supposed to be anymore."**


[12/11/2024 10:20 PM] Narration
Her voice faltered, and her expression grew darker. **"The government promised me a job, it was practically a guarantee when I was at university. I worked so hard for it. I did everything right. But then, out of nowhere, they pulled the rug out from under me. They chose with other candidates. Better-connected ones, probably."** Her lips pressed into a thin line, her eyes glistening with unshed tears. **"It’s nearly impossible not to feel... demoralized after something like that. Like all that effort meant nothing."**

She exhaled deeply, her gaze drifting to the cluttered nightstand behind her. **"And then there’s Haven Heights. Yeah, that Haven Heights. District 9's bad sector. Too dangerous, too unpredictable. But my father insists. I mean, it’s exactly where innovation is needed the most, right? The things I could build there, the lives I could impact... Maybe? It's something I suppose."**

The faint hum of a drone interrupted her thoughts. The device drifted into view with its lens swiveling toward her. Grace’s lips smiled faintly. **"Always watching, huh?"** she murmured, tapping the drone lightly on its chassis. **"Anyway, that’s where I’m at. Just trying to figure it out. Like everyone else, I guess."**

She reached forward, her hand hesitating over the camera. **"Thanks for listening,"** she added softly, her voice barely above a whisper. **"Even if it’s just to clear my own head."**

The screen flickered to black as the video ended.


[12/11/2024 10:28 PM] Kaedues Staub
*(She was dealt a bad hand. Most of the people I know understand the idea.)*

*Kaedues imagines Fairview.. Cedar Square. Hard to imagine messy Grace coming from there, for sure.*

*(Thanks for listening...? That means this video file is a message. Who am I, on the other end?)*

*Our red-haired gofer rewinds the video, watching it again in its entirety.*


[12/11/2024 10:36 PM] Kaedues Staub
*(She's comfortable talking to 'me' about 'home'.. but won't mention her brother by name. Do 'I' not know the person?)*

*He breathes in and moves on, hoping to come back to that point later.*

*(The video began as a confessional. The way Freddie's job was described, it implies 'I' would already understand the man's salary..)*

*(Calling herself the 'good dauughter' also sounds like a confession. Maybe 'I' am an acquaintance.. Maybe I'm an acquaintance to Grace, and I have an existing relationship with Freddie?)*

*(The end of the video is structured like a diary, even though the purpose of the video is to send a message. It sounds like she may be arranged to update 'me' on how her life is progressing.)*


[12/11/2024 10:40 PM] Kaedues Staub
*(It isn't out of the question for her to just be talking to the drone. Some people do like to talk to brick walls like that.)*

*(But..)*

*The photograph. Was the violent jerking from the first video Grace stripping the photograph from the drone?*

*(Is she talking to the photo?)*
*Kaedues scowls a little at the thought of anyone doing something so pointless.*

*(Still, I wonder what image the photo holds.)*


[12/11/2024 10:44 PM] Kaedues Staub
*Kaedues opts to play the last video in the list-- 05/18/2262.*


[12/11/2024 11:04 PM] Narration
The camera flickered to life, revealing Grace seated at her desk. She wore her usual glasses, slightly askew, and her expression was exhaustion and curiosity. **"Okay,"** she started. Her tone was hesitant but conversational. **"So, I’ve been at Haven Heights for a short while. Working for BioTek."** She paused, tucking a strand of hair behind her ear. "It's been a ride, to say the least."

Her lips grimaced. **"At first, it sucked. My boss, Terrance, is… well, let’s just say 'creep' doesn’t even cover it. Always hovering, always making weird comments that make my skin crawl. And then there’s James, my lovely co-worker who seems to think it’s his life’s mission to pick fights with me. Every little thing I do, he’s got to have an opinion on it."**

Grace sighed, slumping in her chair. **"But then there’s Kaedues."** Her voice softened, and a faint smile tugged at her mouth corners. **"He’s… different. Odd, even. But it’s the kind of odd that I get. We’ve worked together on a recent project, and honestly, he's...exceptional? He doesn’t talk much, but when he does, it’s like he’s seeing the world through a completely different lens."**

She sat up straighter, the fatigue in her expression lifting slightly. **"One of those projects was mine, actually. Something I've been working on since I got here. It was just this tiny idea for a competition, nothing serious. But Kaedues saw potential in it. He helped me refine it, made it better than I ever thought it could be. And... corporate noticed."** Her smile widened, genuine pride shining through. **"For the first time since I got here, I felt like I actually belonged. Like I wasn’t just another cog in the machine. Kaedues..."** Her smile fell as it went distant.


[12/11/2024 11:08 PM] Narration
Her voice trailed off, her gaze growing distant as her fingers fidgeted with the edge of her desk. **"Kaedues..."** she murmured softly, almost to herself. Her brow furrowed as she stared at the desk, her voice dropping slightly. **"There’s something about him that just... doesn’t add up. I don’t know if it’s his quietness, or the way he approaches things, but I can’t stop thinking about it. It’s unsettling, honestly. Creepy, even."** She hesitated, her fingers lightly tracing the rim of her glasses. **"But at the same time, I can’t help but want to figure him out. Like there’s some part of me that needs to be understood."**

The smile faltered as she glanced over her shoulder. Her brows furrowed. **"It’s been a weird adjustment, though. Haven Heights is… rough. And sometimes, I wonder if I made the right choice coming here."**

In the background, faint movement was caught in the camera’s eye. A shadow, long and deliberate, slid across the wall behind her. Grace didn’t notice at first, still focused on her thoughts. **"But then, I think about people like Kaedues and the work we’ve done, and I can—"**

Her voice cut off abruptly as she turned, catching the movement out of the corner of her eyes. A figure stood just within the frame at the window, their face obscured by his back. Her breath hitched as recognition set in. It was her father. He held a handgun at his side, his posture rigid as he peered outside her room.

**"Dad?"** she called out, her voice shaky. She rose from her chair, taking a tentative step toward him.

Fred didn’t respond. The camera’s frame shuddered slightly as Grace reached him. She asked him, **"What’s going on?"** she demanded, louder this time. The video cut to black before an answer came, leaving Kaedues staring at the empty screen

__Throughout the entire video, there was a watermark at the top saying, UNEDITED__


[12/11/2024 11:24 PM] Kaedues Staub
*Kaedues pulls the chip drive out of his neck and looks at it, understanding that none of the other videos are fit to view.*

*He just looks at the chip, hanging his eyes on it for.. a while.*
**"Why did you make an entry about me?"** *Kaedues asks out loud.* **"Why did you say I need to be understood?"**

`Aren't you speaking at a chip drive like a person right now?`

*Kaedues heard the voice in the back of his head, like a critic or nagger.. Instinctively, he looks at the nearby mirror.*

[12/11/2024 11:28 PM] Narration
**HONK HONK!** That sounded like a vehicle outside his 'abode'...


[12/11/2024 11:29 PM] Kaedues Staub
*Kaedues pockets the drive and leaves the house with an urgency. He makes a point not to look back inside when he goes.*

*He looks around, hopefully for Carlos.* **"Gavyn sent you, right?"**


[12/11/2024 11:31 PM] Carlos
It was Carlos for sure at the front of the curb. He leaned forwards against the steering wheel, his fingernails tapping the top of the dash. The passenger window was rolled down. **"Sure is, good to see you again."**


[12/11/2024 11:38 PM] Kaedues Staub
**"Yeah, for sure,"** *Kaedues says and walks up to the car. His loss of a pound or so on the left side may become a little more evident then.*

*Kaedues opens the passenger door-- assuming it's unlocked what with the open window, and the point-- and seats himself. The way Kaedues sits in a passenger seat.. well, no one's been a spectator of it until now. The back rest might as well not even be there. He leans forward slightly and rests his elbows on his legs-- arms flowing inward between them.*

**"Appreciate it,"** *He says plainly.* **"I didn't want to be flagged down on the way to Kapea."**


[12/11/2024 11:45 PM] Carlos
He started to pull off to their destination. **"Lawmen are crawling all over the place. Looking for someone I guess. Seen at least three shakedowns on the way here."**


[12/11/2024 11:46 PM] Kaedues Staub
**"How are they armed?"**


[12/11/2024 11:48 PM] Carlos
**"Itchin' for a massacre is how they're armed. Heard from a drone that they are bringing outside help from other districts which means whoever it is, they gotta be loco."** He made a right onto the collector road that connected the neighborhood communities.


[12/11/2024 11:57 PM] Kaedues Staub
**"They've been that way for a few days, then.."** *Kaedues closes his eyes.* **"We just keep it straight and we're fine."**


[12/12/2024 12:04 AM] Carlos
He nodded with a mumble. His eyes glancing around as he continued his way towards Kapea.


[12/12/2024 12:08 AM] Kaedues Staub
*Kaedues stops talking for a while. Only after the smell of smog fills Kaedues' lungs does he speak up again.*
**"Carlos, do you need anything done?"** *He asks, not even looking at the guy.*


[12/12/2024 10:51 PM] Carlos
He shook his head, changing lanes so that he could speed up past a vehicle moving slow. **"Nah man, I got all my work under control on my end. Until the lockdown lifts, trabajo (*work*) is slow."** He would then change the subject. **"Did you finish that proyecto (*project*)? You know? The one with the chica that was with you and that tipo (*guy*) that looked like a jack-ass?"**


[12/12/2024 11:21 PM] Kaedues Staub
*Kaedues nods. That's about all he needed to know about Carlos's life.*

**"Yeah, we got it done. Went to some big corporate building. You never get to know if the job was done right with those types."**

*Kaedues looks out the window. He counts the police cruisers as they pass by.*

**"That gun should have a place somewhere. One day I'll probably get mugged by someone using it."**

*He blows an amused plume of air from his nose.*


[12/13/2024 3:09 PM] Carlos
Carlos chuckled, **"You think so?"** Now getting into the left turn lane as he geared up for getting on the highway


[12/13/2024 6:58 PM] Kaedues Staub
**"The thing was not made to defend yourself. As long as it pays well, and it does."** *Kaedues rests his arm on the car's windowsill and taps his fingers against the warm car door.* **"The engineer who made it was more artsy about it than I am. One of those passion-driven people."**

*There's a rustling in Kaedues' pocket when he fetches his smushed-up container of coconut flavored gum. He opens it up and pulls the last strip out.* **"mm.."** *He makes a mental note to himself as he tosses the strip onto his tongue and chews.*


[12/13/2024 8:58 PM] Carlos
**"Never knew a chica who was interested in guns specifically. It is a lucrative gig if you can move up the ladder. I am still looking for trabajo myself. After quitting Gavyn's gig, I have been doing odd-ball trabajo. Making panels and what not for any compradores."** He merged onto the highway and kicked it into max-gear. 

**"Gavyn called me up, asking if I could give you a ride. Which was no problema, allowed me to pick up some goods from the tienda on the corner."** He pointed his thumb towards the back seat. Bags of miscellaneous snacks, drinks, and other products.


[12/13/2024 9:05 PM] Kaedues Staub
**"Right,"** *Kaedues says assuredly.* **"You saved me the trouble of running over. My van is a scrap heap now."**

*He looks over to Carlos.* **"What was that?"**


[12/13/2024 9:12 PM] Carlos
Glanced over for a second, then back towards the road. **"Ah, nada. Just saying that I am contracting my talentos and I was in the area so picking you up was no problema."** He rephrased.


[12/13/2024 9:19 PM] Kaedues Staub
*Kaedues nods silently. He has not much else to say at the moment.*

*His hands reach to the flash drive around his neck and fiddle with it, without thinking.*

Kaedues forcefully woke up with a involuntary inhale. With his back on the floor.


[1/3/2025 10:11 PM] Kaedues Staub
*Kaedues' eyes dart around. Left, right, up and down.. He sits up like someone who slept in for work might. Sitting up was an instinctive, subconscious thing. Realizing he was prone comes afterward, and feels disorienting to Kaedues..*

**"..What.."**
*He feels it. His hand-- no. No. His __hands__ are trembling. He looks at them, and the rest.. well, it's not even a thought.*
*Something inexplicable, something horrifying, is all around him. The world feels sharp, somehow, or heavy. His breaths become shallow...*

[1/3/2025 10:19 PM] Kaedues Staub
*It's worse. This is worse than the other times. It is __so much__ worse. There is something fundamentally wrong with his situation, and that feeling stretches even farther than just flashing from the van to his house. Something completely obscured to him is performing knife tricks in Kaedues' head..*

**"No.. No, not like this. This isn't how it's..."**
*Whatever context Kaedues was imagining to mutter those words is erased. The world around him becomes darker, and for a fleeting moment, what he actually can see appears to be.. more. The bright colors are brighter and the dark ones are darker, and each color is many times more vivid...*

*When he catches his breath, these effects subside. An __Order__ sets in. This time, Kaedues feels conscious of its presence.*
**"...That's a little easier."** *He says with another breath.*


[1/3/2025 10:26 PM] Kaedues Staub
*Kaedues checks the time with his neural deck.* **"...Wait."**

*This isn't right. It's.. profoundly disturbing, actually. Kaedues gets the feeling he has traveled forward in time. His gut, though, tells him it is something more than that. Is it something he did?*

*..Regardless, the presence of this hand... just looking at it disturbs Kaedues.*
*He takes a moment to deliberate, but confidently calls Danny.*


[1/3/2025 10:32 PM] Narration
It has been five days since Kaedues last was awake. A lot can happen in five days here in District 9...
Kaedues attempted to reach Danny but...

**Destination Unreachable.** - Danny's endpoint was turned off.


[1/3/2025 10:33 PM] Kaedues Staub
**"..Fuck. Fuck!"** *An anger swells within him, but is quickly extinguished. He walks outside, already collected. What does he see?*


[1/3/2025 10:36 PM] Narration
The van in which he was driving to Monita. Gayvn's van was parked just outside his home.


[1/3/2025 10:36 PM] Narration
Traffic was busier than it was during the lockdown. Was the lockdown released?


[1/3/2025 10:37 PM] Kaedues Staub
*Okay. Kaedues calls Gavyn, then. He watches the cars roll past his little inlet. Asides from a narrow road, Kaedues' home is tucked something into an alleyway.*
**"Oh, fuck.."**


[1/3/2025 10:42 PM] Gavyn
He'd pick up after three rings. `"Hey Caliber—guy! How are you feeling?"`


[1/3/2025 10:49 PM] Kaedues Staub
**"..Hey. I am calling to tell you that.. I have my prosthetic hand,"** *he informs Gavyn.* **"I'm going to give your van back now."**
*He pauses a moment.* **"And.. Sorry for the wait."**


[1/3/2025 10:50 PM] Gavyn
`"...Give it back? You don't want it no more?"` He sounded confused.


[1/3/2025 10:52 PM] Kaedues Staub
**"Well, I..."** *There is a drawn out silence on Gavyn's end, punctuated by Kaedues clearing his throat.* **"Unless you're in the market to sell. I'd need to find some spare parts to work on it, though. I'm lucky it got me to... Monita.."**


[1/3/2025 10:56 PM] Gavyn
Silence.... `"...You bought the van."`


[1/3/2025 10:57 PM] Kaedues Staub
**"...What?"** *Brief pause..* **"...How?"**


[1/3/2025 10:58 PM] Gavyn
`"What do you mean? You had Hanson transfer the funds for you since you were going on under for a while. Right?"` Gavyn was extremely confused now.


[1/3/2025 11:09 PM] Kaedues Staub
*There is an extended pause on Kaedues' end, again.* **"...Yeah.. I think I do remember that. Sorry, man. I didn't sleep very well, and I forgot. Thank you for the van."**


[1/3/2025 11:09 PM] Kaedues Staub
*Kaedues hangs up. His brow furrows, and he recalls the events after he began his drive to Monita.*

*....*


[1/3/2025 11:09 PM] Kaedues Staub឵
*`The drive to Monita was uneventful, and didn't take much longer than the last thing he clearly remembers. The place looked a lot like Haven Heights, but there was a lot less trash on the ground and the people there were much quieter.`*

*`Hanson... Kaedues just didn't bother remembering his face. He did very well with his first job. So well, in fact, that Hanson employed him for an additional day. The work earned him those 4,000 micros.`*

*`At the end of Kaedues' venture to Monita, he was a different kind of exhausted. He spent a few hours just sleeping. He only woke up a few minutes ago.. and that's it.`*


[1/3/2025 11:19 PM] Kaedues Staub
*It feels good to sweep that under the rug. With the hand, Kaedues could do a lot more work. It looks expensive. Very expensive. Honestly, it scratches the back of his head when he thinks about the price.*

*Actually.. With 4,000 micros, he could do something. Make an investment, maybe. Repairing the van sounds correct. Without further delay, Kaedues opens the van and looks inside. He tries the ignition, and...*
*..it hums to life with the first turn...*


[1/3/2025 11:19 PM] Kaedues Staub឵
*`Kaedues repaired the van himself already using some spare parts he found at the nearest scrap heap.`*


[1/3/2025 11:19 PM] Kaedues Staub
**"...Ugh.."** *Something isn't sitting right in Kaedues' gut. He turns the van off, closes the door, and locks it. He feels the distinct need to blow off some steam.*


[1/3/2025 11:28 PM] Kaedues Staub
*He looks at the ramshackle wall bordering on his own house and begins to stretch. Time to work.*

*The radio is going to have to be good enough. He tunes in to the local radio station, and continues seeking until he hears something that isn't pop music.*

*With that, Kaedues makes a full sprint towards the wall. He hops and then explodes off the ground upwards. His hands and feet __naturally__ find their footholds on the wall as he scales the shoddy masonry all the way to the top. In just a few moments, Kaedues is standing atop some amalgam of a corrugated rooftop...*

*..looking down at The Stacks.*

*A hop, skip, and a jump away is all it takes for Kaedues to pick up his usual rhythm, his usual route. He navigates away from his house and into the surrounding neighborhood, jumping across gaps in buildings and the like. There is a distinct sense of relief Kaedues gets when he navigates the stacks like this. This is better than driving around, or walking the sidewalk.*

*He uses this time to survey the area as well, to see if anything has changed in the apparent days since Hanson employed him in Monita.*

Kaedues returned to his home with no incident. Huh, usually, there is a shooting or a mugging along the way, especially with how late it was in the day. In fact, there was nothing of interest going on in the Stacks. It was eeriely quiet...


[1/26/2025 9:36 PM] Kaedues Staub
*Without the deafening noise of gunshots and screaming and tweakers, Haven Heights is filled with a certain kind of unsettling quiet. The sound of cars passing in the distance, streetlights and air conditioners humming, and the sound of his own boots clocking the pavement make up this kind of quiet.*

*(There's a few people outside.. but it's quiet. What's going on?)*
*Kaedues gets out of his van and locks the door. He continues forward regardless to enter his home.*


[1/26/2025 9:47 PM] Narration
Kaedues entered his abode to find it... No different.

Everything remained the same as he had left it. It always has been this way.


[1/26/2025 9:55 PM] Kaedues Staub
*Good. Kaedues closes the door and walks to one end of the room, where the wall casts a lingering shadow on the dusted floor below. He turns to face the door and sits down. He allows his eyelids to fall shut, his arms to lay limp.. or at least he tries to. Kaedues finds right now that he has.. a hard time lulling himself to sleep.*

*He lays down, then, his eyes still wide open.*
*(Going to sleep.. I should, but I shouldn't. I need to rest. It hasn't been a tiring day, but tomorrow could be.)*

*Kaedues forcefully closes his eyes and avoids thought all together. With some time committed, Kaedues soon finds himself asleep.*

*`The sound of irate drivers honking their horns punctuated the atmosphere of Haven Heights. A gentle, rhythmic hum of sounds pulsed through the air, like the electronic sting of a song you couldn’t quite name. The rooftops stretched endlessly, blending together in surreal perfection, as though the world had been designed just for this moment.`*

*`The wind carried a unique sensation—calm yet exhilarating—that made him feel alive. The air filled his lungs, providing much-needed oxygen and giving him strength.`*

*`Aerial vehicles drifted lazily across the sky, while Fairview and Neon Kyrie’s imposing skyscrapers towered beyond the clouds. At first, it was just him standing on a rooftop, the wind tugging at his hair and teasing the edges of his hoodie. He glanced down at his sturdy boots, which had withstood the test of time.`*

*`Kaedues looks down at the streets below. At times like this, heights feel.. well, it instills an odd feeling within Kaedues, something definitely uplifting. Even he can understand it; the feeling of being above the place he surfs through every day.`*

*`He breathes in again, letting the air fill his lungs. It's... nice. Even the taste, if he could call it that, is something Kaedues wishes he could experience more often.`*

*`The ladder rungs emitted a distinct sound that echoed across the corrugated sheet metal roof he stood on, each note resonating in the dynamically changing air. With each ascending step, the vibrations grew more potent, sending tremors through the structure beneath him, amplifying as the climber drew nearer. He could almost feel the metallic surface hum beneath his feet, a subtle reminder of the ascent unfolding just out of sight.`*

**Turn around...** *`Was the impulsive thought that was told to him.`*


[1/27/2025 7:00 PM] Kaedues Staub
*`And so he does. Kaedues turns around to get a look at the person ascending the ladder. His index finger and thumb rub together habitually. When the wind licks his red hairs into his face, he squints his eyes.`*


[1/27/2025 7:00 PM] Grace Dawson
*`A familiar head peeked over the edge of the roof. Grace's eyes conveyed worry in every possible way. Being this high up was not something she enjoyed, and climbing buildings that clearly did not meet safety codes made her increasingly uneasy. But, she pulled herself up onto the roof nonetheless. Careful to be mindful of her footing while she walked away from the edge.`* **`"You sure it is alright for us to be up here?"`** *`She asks, clearly worried about the repercussions that could follow.`*


[1/27/2025 7:00 PM] Kaedues Staub
**`"Yes,"`** *`Kaedues states plainly. His eyes track to Grace for a few moments, and then he turns away to look at the street again.`* **`"I come here a lot. It's.. good."`** *`Kaedues cuts his own train of thought short as he responds to her.`*


[1/27/2025 7:00 PM] Grace Dawson
*`Grace approached him, sharing in the sights he was observing. She was curious. Was it really good? It would be best for her to understand what he meant or felt by that statement.`* **`"..?"`** *`Unlike Kaedues, Grace did not trust her sense of balance enough to walk to the very edge like him. But, she did make an attempt to stretch a bit to garner a good glimspe.`*


[1/27/2025 7:00 PM] Grace Dawson឵
**`"This something you do regularly?"`** *`she inquired, her curiosity piqued. She known he said he did this somewhat frequently, but something on her mind seem to have kept her from recalling the said conversation.`*


[1/27/2025 7:00 PM] Kaedues Staub
**`"Being active is one of the things that keeps my... spirits up."`** *`Kaedues finishes his statement with an upward tone as if it were a question. He had a hard time putting that one into words.`*

*`He takes a few steps backwards and sits down on the corrugated roof.`* **`"Running and climbing have always felt correct to me."`** *`His vision drifts toward Grace. When he gets a good look, his head tilts slightly off to the side and his eyes narrow.`*


[1/27/2025 7:00 PM] Grace Dawson
*`As Kaedues looked over towards her, she did not do the same to him. Her gaze shifted to the skyline provided by the elevation of the building they were upon. Grace's locks danced in the consistent breeze. Her gaze were distant, yet in the present. Trying her best to resonate with his feelings.`* **`"..."`**


[1/27/2025 7:01 PM] Grace Dawson឵
*`Then, a thin smile happened across her face. She had not done anything like this before and despite the problems and chaos that surrounds Haven Heights, there was something surreal about what was before them. Something cathartic..`* **`"I think I feel it too, maybe.."`** *`She then walked away from him, getting a different angle of the world around them. Despite the smog, the scene was quite serene in her eyes.`* **`"You can see so much from up here. Like a bird, or the view you see when you're in a AV or something."`**


[1/27/2025 7:01 PM] Kaedues Staub
*`Kaedues nods.`* **`"Yes. I agree with that,"`** *`He replies. A soft, grudged noise escapes from his throat before he speaks again.`* **`"I ought to learn how to drive an AV."`** *`He muses to himself.`* **`"Could do a lot with that knowledge."`**


[1/27/2025 7:01 PM] Grace Dawson
*`Grace looked over her shoulder towards Kaedues.`* **`"You seem like someone who would be a natural at it."`**

*`Shuffling back into his direction, she would go on to say,`* **`"Have you given university thought? So you could pilot one?"`**

*`She then knelt down beside him. Looking into his eyes.`*
**`"Come to think of it... You're a natural in everything I've seen you do."`**


[1/27/2025 7:01 PM] Kaedues Staub
*`Kaedues' eyes are characteristically devoid of color and full of depth, like colorless gems. Flint, if it could be peered into.`*
*`He returns her look. His expression twists somewhat in response to her question.`*
**`"I barely manage to pay rent. I don't have the money to even think about further schooling."`** *`Kaedues sounds a little upset about the detail.`*

*`Her last comment is curious to the redhead.`* **`"And what have you seen me do? Clean up shop?"`**


[1/27/2025 7:01 PM] Grace Dawson
*`She did not seem bothered by his colorless voids. It was a detail never captured by Grace.`*

**`"You know how to talk to people. That's something even I find difficult for myself... You know how to read prints, even when I never saw you work on one in the workshop."`**

*`She regarded him a bit longer.`* **`"You... Stand out, but I cannot explain why... The best I can describe it is that I see everyone in one color, but when I see you... You're illuminated, like I'm meant to pay attention to you."`**


[1/27/2025 7:01 PM] Grace Dawson឵
**`"Errm... I don't think I should have phrased it like that..."`** *`She was now extremely self conscious.`*


[1/27/2025 7:01 PM] Grace Dawson
**`"Yet, I did..."`** *`She would let out an exasperate sigh. Her cheeks began to glow. How embarrassing!`*


[1/27/2025 7:01 PM] Kaedues Staub
*`Kaedues closes his eyes tightly for a moment as he considers how to continue from here.`* **`"I was going to tell you something not far off from that a few seconds ago."`**

*`Kaedues' eyes look up to Grace's hair, and then her face, and then her clothes, and then back up to her face. He opens his mouth to speak, but ultimately what would have been his statement forms as a silent exhale.`*


[1/27/2025 7:01 PM] Grace Dawson
**`"Hmm..."`** *`Grace tilted her head slightly, her brow furrowing as she delved into her thoughts. She wasn’t sure why she felt this way—it wasn’t romantic, at least not in the way one might assume. It was something deeper, something harder to define. She sifted through her memories of their interactions, tracing every detail, every moment, every nuance that could explain the way Kaedues seemed to stand out in her world.`*

*`She recalled the quiet way he observed, how he seemed to notice things others overlooked. It wasn’t just that he was different—it was the nature of that difference. Like he didn’t quite belong to the same rhythm as everyone else, yet somehow harmonized with it in a way she couldn’t ignore.`*

*`Was it his silence? His meticulous, deliberate way of working things out when he did? Or maybe it was the way he seemed to carry a weight she couldn’t quite name, like his thoughts lived in layers she’d never been invited to see. Whatever it was, it wasn’t loud or showy—it was like a whisper just loud enough for her to hear.`*

*`Grace’s gaze dropped to her hands, her fingers absently tracing invisible lines in the air. She tried to map it out logically, as if understanding him could be reduced to a series of patterns and connections. But the more she thought about it, the less sense it made.`*

**`"Maybe it’s…"`** *`she began but trailed off, her words evaporating as quickly as they formed. Her head tilted further as though angling her thoughts might align them more clearly.`* **`"It’s not something I can measure or explain. It’s not like you’re louder than anyone else, or brighter, or—"`** *`She stopped herself and shook her head slightly.`* **`"No, that’s not it. You’re just… there in a way, no one else is."`**


[1/27/2025 7:02 PM] Kaedues Staub
*`Kaedues feels his shoulders become tense with the conversation.`* **`"I don't know what to say to that. Honestly, I draw a blank when I think about the details at times like this."`** *`His roughened left hand reaches behind his head, rubbing at the back of his neck.`*

**`"It's easier for me to just let the questions I can't answer fly over my head. Down there, on the ground, I can get a lot more done that way."`** *`Kaedues states. Leave it to him to bring the conversation back around to his working environment.`*


[1/27/2025 7:02 PM] Grace Dawson
**`"A blank? But, doesn't that bother you? Even a little?"`** *`She came down slowly to her knees, resting her body on the heels of her feet.`*


[1/27/2025 7:02 PM] Kaedues Staub
**`"That's a hard question,"`** *`He replies flatly, and turns to face Grace. His thick, level brows and dull expression could betray his earnest in the conversation.`* **`"In the moment, it does bother me. Sometimes, a thought in my head is enough to set me off all day. Once I sleep it off at the end of the day, it's always gone."`** *`He admits to her, but the way he turns his head and tucks the corners of his lips says something else.`*

**`"I don't even know.. how I know. I can't give you an example of it happening. It just feels true."`**


[1/27/2025 7:02 PM] Grace Dawson
*`Grace watched his expressions, his ticks, and his words. She might not be the most charismatic or outspoken. But, that never prevented her from finding answers.`*

*`Why would she go this far for this guy? I mean, it's like they've only met! The answer was obvious: he was one of the only people who truly cared. He deserved this.`*

*`She was racking her brain. Was this some joke? No, it wasn't a joke. Kaedues wasn't one to jest.`*

**`"Do you think... It could be that..."`**

*`The world went mute. The only viable sound was that of his own heartbeat. The sounds of his blood flowing through his veins. Then, once she finished, everything came back.`*


[1/27/2025 7:02 PM] Kaedues Staub
*`Kaedues' eyes narrow and his eybrows lower. He leans forward insistently, a clear indication that he is listening.. or at least trying to.`*
**`"What did you say?"`** *`He asks. Maybe he's bewildered by what she said, or can't believe it? Who would even need to ask for clarification at a time like this, anyway?`*


[1/27/2025 7:02 PM] Grace Dawson
**`"I asked you if you think this is really working anymore. I don't think it's working, Kaedues."`** *`Grace's expression has shifted to one of concern. Her features appear a layer more vibrant, almost impossible to look away from. Her position has shifted in an instant, sitting with her legs crossed on the corrugated metal rooftop in front of Kaedues.`*

**`"It's a bad idea, Kaedues. Keeping me here like this. You really shouldn't."`**

**`"Keeping you.. Grace, what do you--"`**


[1/27/2025 7:02 PM] Grace Dawson
**`"I didn't fully agree to this, Kaedues.. I.. I don't like being here anymore."`**

**`"Grace, we don't have to stay up here.."`**

[1/27/2025 7:03 PM] Kaedues Staub
*`Kaedues wills his body to get up, to approach her, to shake her by her shoulders.. but he can't. He can't move.`*
**`"Let's go back."`** *`He feels the words come out of his mouth, but he didn't put them there.`*


[1/27/2025 7:03 PM] Grace Dawson
**`"Can I just... Could I just look, please? Just a look.."`**


[1/27/2025 7:03 PM] Kaedues Staub
*`To Kaedues, this is.. particularly grounding. This feels so.. out of character.. for Grace. Characters.. a narrative. He reaches, instinctually, into his pocket. He feels them between his fingers; The broken plastic frame that used to be her glasses.`*

*`So he can move after all? Why can he move? Before he can answer her, move toward her, even think...`*

*Kaedues shoots up into a sitting position. He grasps the cloth hanging from his chest with his right hand, trying to quell his beating heart. Fast.. Fast, it pumps in his chest like it has somewhere to be. He breathes quickly, too quickly. Kaedues feels anxious, horrified. These feelings are only strengthened by the feeling of the sun beating down on him from outside.*

*He looks up through the window. Reflexively his hand moves to cover his eyes from that blinding light...*

A cloud shrouded the sun, allowing Kaedues some relief from the beating sun through the kitchen sink window. A bird pecking at the sill upon the ledge of the ajar window. It chirped again, keeping its eye on Kaedues in case he became a threat.


[1/27/2025 7:38 PM] Kaedues Staub
*Kaedues takes a few more deep breaths to try and still his trembling hands, quiet his running mind. It's not working. The numbers... 581677. **581677.***

*The bird... Kaedues usually doesn't see them in his windows. Actually.. he doesn't open his windows. He hasn't, at least.*

*Quickly, Kaedues jumps to his feet and looks around.*
*(Did someone try to rob me while I was asleep?)*


[1/27/2025 7:44 PM] Narration
It was enough to startle the bird when Kaedues jumped up to his feet. Prompting it to fly off into the streets of 'The Stacks'. Kaedues attempted to locate anything that would lead him to any clues of a break-in, but nothing came about. The Kitchen counter was soaked. the window had dried water staining it.


[1/27/2025 7:52 PM] Kaedues Staub
*It'd be easiest to assume that a storm or something from last night blew the windows open, soaked the counters. This place is falling apart as it is, so it wouldn't be unreasonable.*

*Kaedues performs a sweep of the entire home just to be safe. Someone from Haven Heights can just never be too safe in situations like this.*

-# ***581677**.. the numbers ring out quietly in his head again.*

`"Hello?"` There was feminine voice, younger in tone. No older than 18, no younger than 12. Familiar even. Though, nothing that really stands out. How many people had he interacted with could fit the criteria?

*Kaedues takes one more look at the space he slept in and moves out. He takes a brief look at his surroundings outside as he moves to his van.*

*With a turn of the key, the door opens and he seats himself in the driver's seat. Those same keys turn the ignition and start the van.*
*Now, with the quiet his van provides, Kaedues finds himself thinking a bit before moving out.*

*(What was that?)*
*He lingers on the thought for a few moments before veering out of his little inlet and driving off towards Littleton, where the site he mentioned is.*

Kaedues returned to the Metro to continue working odd jobs. Who would've known that the Metro of all places was a hotspot for client who needed this and that done. Perhaps, since it was the Metro, everyone could afford the wildly overpriced items that were there... There was a light rain, gently batting the windshield of the utility van that Kaedues was recently the proud owner of. 

The only working headlight of the passing vehicle reflected brightly from the rain, but only for a brief moment because their last remaining headlight blew... Nice..

Kaedues home was just up ahead, as usual. It was pitch black, just as he always leaves it. The question was, was Sophie there? It was that appropriate time for her to return here, if she was to listen to Kaedues in the first place...


[3/1/2025 10:13 PM] Kaedues Staub
*Kaedues climbs out of the van's driver seat and makes way toward his house. He doesn't need to bother unlocking the door, and moves to open it right away, but..*
*(..If she's here, it might make a good impression to.. announce myself.)*

**"I'm coming in,"** *He says. He doesn't shout or anything, but since the house is built so poorly anyone on the inside could likely hear him. He opens the door and turns the light on himself.*


[3/1/2025 10:16 PM] Narration
**"mmrgh..."** The sound of a soft moan filled Kaedues ears, coming from his immediate left and close!


[3/1/2025 10:17 PM] Kaedues Staub
*He looks over reactively, not leaving the doorway yet. The thought that she could be sleeping crosses his mind, so he allows his hand to hang by the light switch.*

It was unmistakably Sophie. The sleeping bag lay crumpled against the wall, and she was nestled within it, her disheveled hair spilling over the edge. Her face, pale and drawn, suggested she had just woken up from a restless slumber, with dark circles under her eyes hinting at a lack of restful sleep. She blinked involuntarily a few times, looking in his general direction but not at him. (Too much effort to look up at the guy.) 

**"..."**


[3/1/2025 10:31 PM] Kaedues Staub
**"Oh."** *Kaedues utters, sounding surprised to see Sophie here in the first place. His eyes gloss over her for a moment, and then he turns the light back off. In the dark, he turns to face Sophie proper and crouches down.*

**"I didn't see the shard case,"** *He says softly aloud. He considers a softer approach to sussing out this situation...* **"If you tell me you know where it is, I'll leave and let you sleep."**
*(I think I should try not to ask her questions. People are predisposed to react defensively to them.)*
*His eyes tighten in the dark. Something about hearing himself think that...*


[3/1/2025 10:34 PM] Sophie Donovan
**"Why are you so worried about it? Of course, I know where it is."** Her statement was defensive but not as tense as she could have been. She rubbed her eyes and sighed in exasperation. Sleep was no longer an option now, and it was a result she was destined to accept.


[3/1/2025 10:35 PM] Kaedues Staub
**"Mn."** *He only punctuates her statement with a grunt or noise of some kind, and then leaves. He goes to approach the loading bay of his van...*


[3/2/2025 12:27 AM] Kaedues Staub
*With no obstructions, he.. just climbs inside. After locking the van, he walks to the box situated inside the van and sits down in front of it...*

*He crosses his legs and opens the box up. It takes him a few moments to process again what he's looking at.. but these are the remains of Grace's belongings from Shop 1113. He's not interested in snooping, so he doesn't open up the data pads or whatnot. The redhead does however look closer at the data pads, at the rifle parts too..*

*(These are.. Grace's things. For some reason, I didn't realize it.)*
*(But.. I.. Put this here...) Kaedues thinks to himself. Only when he strains himself, when he makes the intent to think about it, does he remember that __he__ organized the items in the box, that __he__ put this here..*

*(I put this here... I put this here.) Kaedues repeats to himself in his head. (I forgot that I put this here. How could I even do that? I forgot?)*


[3/2/2025 1:27 AM] Kaedues Staub
*His eyes begin to narrow out, converging on closing shut as he begins to ask or interrogate himself.*
*(I __forgot__ that these were hers. I forgot I put them here....) His eyebrows begin to come together as he stews on the thought. The box's placement in the van is like a thread fished through a small hole. Kaedues closes his eyes and grabs hold of it, pulling on the conceptual thread..*

*Of course, the box is there because Grace no longer works at the shop, because she is likely being taken around by her father. Her father, the terrorist. The terrorist.*
*(Of all the things I could misplace, this is.. not one of them. I remember the elevator music from BioTek's offices, I remember that I have 11 sticks of gum left in my pack, I remember the name of that woman Noelle who I ran an odd errand for and practically decided to forget about. But when I think about Grace, when I think about..) He feels the thread pull even further now. His hand unconsciously moves to grab his left shoulder. (The.. crash.. and the days after it..)*

*(I'm drawing a blank. Why? ..No.. when? When did this start to happen?)*
*Then, it happens. A knot in the thread on the other end of the hole stops Kaedues from pulling any more.  An image, no, a moving picture appears in his head. It's Grace, outside the shop, talking to him. Along with the picture, or perhaps because of it, an __electric__ pain shoots through his head like a live wire. He loses his balance and falls onto his side, clutching his head in any attempt to manually stabilize himself.. but it doesn't work.*


[3/2/2025 1:27 AM] Kaedues Staub
*After some moments of tossing and turning, of gritting his teeth in pain, it lets up. The image he conjured is still burned into his head. While it is, Kaedues makes a point of pressing his index finger and thumb together. He feels the pain of his index fingertip bending backwards-- not enough to break, but enough to hurt-- and commits it to memory.*

*Kaedues attempts to sit up, but he is quick to discover that his arms don't want to obey him anymore. He falls limp onto the cold metal floor of the loading bay, asleep.*

[3/2/2025 6:28 PM] Kaedues Staub
*Suddenly, Kaedues shoots awake. He pants heavily against the familiar smelling air and grips his bedsheets instinctually out of panic. It was a nightmare, he realizes. It was all a bad dream. He looks down at his little hands. The image of those larger, tougher palms and fingers are still burned into his mind. He winces at the thought of losing one of his hands in the first place.*

*He blinks a few times to get the moisture back into his eyes, and tosses his powder-blue bedsheet across his bed. He navigates across the tiled floor. Without the night-light near the switch, he probably would have had a difficult time making it there in the first place.*

*The switch controls and activates a bright overhead light, illuminating the entirety of Kaedues' bedroom. The walls are painted plain white, and the floors are made of industry-grade tile. The seams between each piece are so small you'd be hard pressed to fit a hair between.*

*Kaedues' bed, located on the right side of the room and on the far end from where he is now, is pointed left. It's a large slab of heavy plastic without a real head or foot, and on top of it rests a thin, easy-to-replace mattress.*

*Directly in front of Kaedues is the window. It's made of sandblasted glass, and is encased in a simple white frame. He can't make out any details outside, but it's definitely.. very dark outside the window.*


[3/2/2025 6:28 PM] Kaedues Staub
*What Kaedues is looking for however is not the window or the bed. He directs his attention left, at a thick shelf standing upright against the wall. There are his toys. Fidgeting with them helps him relax, and after seeing all of that.. he feels like he needs it.*

*The shelf was only a few steps away. Kaedues sits down and crosses his legs before reaching into one of the shelf's compartments and pulling out his favorite little trinket.. a translucent block and a little marble. Inscribed beneath the surface of this block are ridges that together create a maze.*

*Kaedues inserts the marble into a small hole in the block, and begins to rotate the toy around in his hands. He rolls the marble into different nooks and crannies of the block's maze, with the end goal appearing to be retrieving the marble again.*


[3/2/2025 6:29 PM] N̸̼̊ar̵r̵̦͑a̴̎t̶o̶͕͑r
*Kaedues would continue to fiddle with his instrument for a few minutes. Though initially uninterrupted, the sound of dialogue from the other end of his bedroom door causes him to flinch and lose all of his progress in the block's little game.*


[3/2/2025 6:29 PM] Kaedues Staub
*He turns his head to the sound of the people talking. The shock alone causes him to drop the block and climb to his feet. He turns his body to look at the door, suddenly curious of the voices leaking in. He finds himself walking slowly towards that closed door, and when he reaches it he presses his ear up against it...*


[3/2/2025 8:40 PM] N̸̼̊ar̵r̵̦͑a̴̎t̶o̶͕͑r
*The voices beyond the door are muffled, barely able to be understood at all.*


[3/2/2025 8:40 PM] Masculine Figure
**"..acting this way, you are setting yourself up for failure."**
*A male voice cuts in. He sounds fatherly and authoritative..*


[3/2/2025 8:40 PM] Feminine Figure
**"You don't see it my way because you don't __want__ to see it my way. Would it kill you to open up? To just.. try?"**
*A female voice retorts. She sounds upset, but still inviting to a more progressive conversation.*


[3/2/2025 8:40 PM] Kaedues Staub
*(My mom and dad are fighting..)*
*The thought appears in Kaedues' head. He looks down at his feet and, after a moment of deliberation, presses his index finger and thumb together. No matter how hard he presses, there is no pain.*

*Kaedues leans further against the door, trying to hear more of what is going on.*


[3/2/2025 8:40 PM] Masculine Figure
**"It's not about what I think. You are..."** *There's a pause, which is cut into at the earliest opportunity..*


[3/2/2025 8:40 PM] Feminine Figure
**"I'm what? Every time I ever press you about this, you stammer and clam up like there's something you aren't--"**


[3/2/2025 8:40 PM] Masculine Figure
**"You are at the end of the road."** *The voice cuts in firmly.* **"If you keep going like this, you'll find more than you asked for. More than you need to know, and more than you should."**

*After another pause, there's an audible sigh from the man.*
**"When that happens.. when you know.. the project will come to a close. It will all be over."**


[3/2/2025 8:40 PM] Feminine Figure
*There's another pause before the woman's voice responds.* **"Why?"**


[3/2/2025 8:40 PM] Masculine Figure
*There's just a soft grunt from the man on the other end.*


[3/2/2025 8:40 PM] Feminine Figure
**"Hans, I want to know why."**

*By shifting his weight, Kaedues happens to fall foward. The door to his bedroom swings open. Somehow, he knows that he shouldn't have done that.*

*The space beyond the door is devoid of anything. There is no sound, no light, no texture. A black expanse of emptiness blankets the space beyond, leaving only the silhouettes of the man and woman he had been listening to a few feet away.*

*Their heads turn to look at him. The male in shock, the female in awe.*
*A distant waveform noise stirs to life in the distance, growing louder, closer as the seconds pass. Kaedues watches as the man and woman begin arguing again, but the monotone droning noise quickly drowns them out entirely.*


[3/2/2025 8:40 PM] Kaedues Staub
*The noise becomes everything Kaedues is capable of processing, and more. A white light encompasses his vision, so vast and intense that he can't just avert his eyes. He grasps his head and writhes on the ground, trying to force it out. He covers his ears, or closes his eyes, or screams.. but nothing happens...*

*Kaedues wakes up only a few hours later than he slept. He shoots into an upright position and clutches his jumpsuit. A flash of that white light replays in Kaedues' head when his eyes cross a stray sunbeam glimmering in from the van's window. He recoils quickly, scrambling backwards until his back hits a wall of the loading bay..*


[3/2/2025 8:58 PM] Kaedues Staub឵
*Kaedues grabs hold of himself and stands up. After dusting himself off, he exits the loading bay of his van and approaches his home. He opens the door again, and allows the natural light from outside to spread to the immediate area around the doorway. First thing he does is look for Sophie.*


[3/2/2025 9:00 PM] Narration
Sophie was **not** present. Her sleeping bag was opened up and her case of shards seemingly missing alongside her.


[3/2/2025 9:28 PM] Kaedues Staub
*(It might not get much better than this. But at least she showed up.)*

*With that underway, Kaedues moves to his home's bathroom, where he would briefly get ready for the day. He showers, brushes his teeth, combs his hair, all that. The whole ordeal only takes a few minutes, but the feeling he gets from being clean is a nice wake-up call from the earlier dream.*

*After he's done freshening up, Kaedues leaves his home and climbs back into the driver's seat of his van. He fires up the engine and pulls out of the inlet accompanying his home and sets out to park near the metro spot and enter the underground labyrinth again, just like last time.*

[3/7/2025 11:03 PM] Narration
Kaedues pulled into his driveway with no immediate problems to be concerned of. Sophie remained asleep for the entire duration of the ride and the moments that the trip could be considered rough, she did not stir for any of them.


[3/7/2025 11:17 PM] Kaedues Staub
*Kaedues turns to look at Sophie, acknowledging that she is still asleep.*
*(She will definitely wake up if I touch her at all. I can't move her to the house. Sleep is important, especially to children. She will think clearer with sleep, which is good for me. And for her.)*

*He gets up and out of the van, pulling the door latch slowly and stepping out one foot at a time so the van does not rock. Then, he closes the door.*
*(I should make preparations for the second half...) he thinks to himself. Kaedues pulls up his contact list. It doesn't take long to find the name.*
```fix
- Gavyn
  > Grace Dawson
- Hanson Greaves
```

*Kaedues stares at the name. Once Sophie is out, he might be satisfied as to Danny's condition.*
*....__might__. The word creates a tension in Kaedues' chest. He closes his contact list, and quietly enters the van's driver seat again.*
*(I need the van, and for Sophie to sleep as much as possible. So..)*
*Kaedues adjusts the position of his back rest so that it lays prone. He rests his back on it and focuses on a single point on the van's roof. He will wait here until she wakes up, for a couple hours if necessary.*

[3/7/2025 11:35 PM] Sophie Donovan
Sophie was asleep for **4** hours. Despite the window to the utility van being up, water collected at the top of the door and a single droplet broke through the crevasse and landed on her cheek as she rested against the glass.

She flinched at first before slowly opening her eyes. It was raining, this wasn't her sleeping bag and certainly not the Condo. 

Sophie sat up lethargically, groaning as she did so. Her surroundings were different, waking up in a place she was not familiar with was. First, she looked around the exterior of the van through the windows. It was a neighborhood, obviously... Then, she looked towards the driver seat.


[3/7/2025 11:40 PM] Kaedues Staub
*Kaedues isn't looking at her. He's still looking straight up, at the roof of the van. His legs have since been propped up onto the dashboard, left of the steering wheel, and his hands come together at his chest; his fingers lacing together.*

*It is of course unclear if Kaedues had been watching her or not.. or if he is even awake. He is so completely still that he could pass for sleeping with his eyes open.*


[3/8/2025 12:02 AM] Sophie Donovan
She just sits there and watches him. One blink... two blinks—three. **"What are you thinking of?"** She asks out of the blue.


[3/8/2025 12:08 AM] Kaedues Staub
*Kaedues turns his head to look at her. It takes him a moment to pull himself back into the living world, to respond.*
**"..Your father. A conversation we had before.. everything happened. Before it was made this way."** *He answers, his tone neutral as it always is.*


[3/8/2025 12:09 AM] Sophie Donovan
She processes his response for a brief moment of time. Enough to acknowledge that she was indeed awake and coherent enough to hold a conversation. **"What was it about?"**


[3/8/2025 12:13 AM] Kaedues Staub
*Kaedues turns to look at the roof of the van again. A small, almost imperceptible pause is sandwiched between her question and his answer.*
**"I told him there was something wrong with me."**


[3/8/2025 12:15 AM] Sophie Donovan
She continues her slow blinks once he replied. What an odd confession to make, or at least, to her. **"What did he say?"** She fired off another quesiton!


[3/8/2025 12:20 AM] Kaedues Staub
**"...He was interrupted by a doctor at the time. I had lost my hand. It was the same night I initially stayed at the condo your father owns."** *Kaedues raises his cybernetic hand and wiggles it around, showing it to Sophie.*

**"He brought it back up a few minutes later. Asked me if I was okay. So.. I told him about.."** *He pauses to think. What he needs to think about, who is to say, but after a second or three he continues.*
**"A symptom I have.. well, that is the best way to describe it at least."**


[3/8/2025 12:26 AM] Sophie Donovan
**"...I guess that sounds like him."** She remarked, reaching in jacket to take inventory of everything.


[3/8/2025 12:29 AM] Kaedues Staub
*Kaedues uprights himself and returns the driver's seat to the position it was in before he waited for her to wake up. Maybe he assumes she is not interested, or maybe he is attempting to redirect the conversation when he says,*

**"Do you feel well rested?"**


[3/8/2025 3:37 PM] Sophie Donovan
Sophie thought of the question before ultimately shrugging with the tilt of her head and one shoulder. **"Yeah."**

Her attention went to the aerial vehicles that was flying in the distant skyline. It were those hi-tech government vehicles, flying in group of 5 towards the West (Direction to Kapea and Monita).

Without taking her eyes off the vehicles, she advanced to her next question for Kaedues. **"How long was I asleep?"**


[3/8/2025 3:43 PM] Kaedues Staub
*He responds quickly. Maybe he was quick to check the time, or maybe he knew the answer already.*
**"Four hours and change,"** *He says. He can see the vehicles but his attention isn't necessarily attuned to them.*


[3/8/2025 4:08 PM] Sophie Donovan
Sophie did not ask any more questions or made other remarks after that. Proceeding from here must be pretty awkward...


[3/8/2025 4:27 PM] Kaedues Staub
**"Alright.. Let's go."** *Kaedues is quick to break the silence. He turns the keys in the ignition, starting the van. He also checks his mirrors and his blind spots, and for good measure, the loading bay.*


[3/8/2025 4:30 PM] Sophie Donovan
**"...?"** Those words were confusing to Sophie. `"Let's go"` *Let's go where?*... Sophie's attention turned towards Kaedues, and she watched his routine with inquisitive eyes. Her lips slightly parted, as her curiosity was genuine.


[3/8/2025 4:35 PM] Kaedues Staub
*He reaches to the flash drive around his neck and pulls it loose; slotting it into a free port in the van's radio. Once properly loaded, a simple synth track would begin to play. However, it cuts out as Kaedues quickly fiddles with some of the buttons on the radio, changing the track to something else entirely.*

[3/8/2025 4:35 PM] Kaedues Staub
*He glances over at Sophie, analyzing her expression in no time. His eyes return to the windshield as he pulls out of his driveway.*
*(She doesn't look nervous.)*
**"We have to lay low for a couple weeks, and lower than I thought. I am taking you shopping for a costume change,"** *Kaedues begins to explain.* **"After that.. we're going somewhere else. I can't tell you where because it would __break custom__ but you won't have to leave the van if you do not want to."**


[3/8/2025 5:02 PM] Sophie Donovan
**"Costume..."** She parroted, but did not have much more to comment on.


[3/8/2025 5:10 PM] Kaedues Staub
**"..Well, Doug commented that he jumped the wall. He commented that he was being tailed after taking Mia, so it is safe to assume they are still after him."**
*Kaedues stops at a red light on his way to any one of Littleton's shopping districts.* **"He jumped back over to look for you. The agents can use that detail to assume he is looking for someone,"** *Kaedues explains.* **"...Changing how you look will only stall for time, but we are lucky. Not a lot of time we need to buy."**


[3/8/2025 5:13 PM] Sophie Donovan
Her brow furrowed slightly. **"I don't think I would be willing to 'change' how I look."**


[3/8/2025 5:17 PM] Kaedues Staub
*Kaedues pauses for a moment and rolls his tongue around in his mouth. Once the light turns green, he continues to drive to where ever he was going.*
**"Sophie, these agents already know what you look like. Topped by that, there aren't a lot of kids down here. You are easier to spot than you think."**

*He waits a spell to hopefully allow Sophie to soak up some of that info.* **"When I said that, what kind of change did you think of?"** *He asks.*


[3/8/2025 5:24 PM] Sophie Donovan
**"With you making the suggestion, I don't know what I am think of."** She retorted, looking out the passenger window.


[3/8/2025 5:44 PM] Kaedues Staub
**"...Right.."** *He comments. Exhasperation toils on his voice.* **"I'll make this simpler. You have to choose __something__. If you don't like it, I do not blame you."** *Making another turn, Kaedues draws a little closer to the shopping outlets.*

**"You don't need to complicate the idea... when I stayed at your condo in Fairview, I wound up buying a set of clothes to blend in better with the people there. This isn't any different."** *Kaedues looks into the rearview mirror, glancing at Sophie through it and then at the space behind the van.*

**"Switching clothes is going to be a given. In your situation, I would cut my hair.. but I'm not pushy. As long as you do something, we are square."**


[3/8/2025 5:49 PM] Sophie Donovan
**"Dress like I am from Haven Heights? I suppose, I could do that..."**


[3/8/2025 5:54 PM] Kaedues Staub
*Kaedues nods slowly. After a few more minutes, he slows the van to a stop outside a local clothing store. Once he feels the weight of the vehicle gently push against his chest, he puts her into park and undoes his seatbelt. With a pull on the latch, the van's door opens and he steps outside. He pulls the door in but does not close it yet.*

[3/9/2025 10:42 PM] Narration
Kaedues rounded the corner that would then lead him down the narrow alley-road which his home resided to find that there was unusual activity occuring. His neighbor was begin visited by the CCR. There were two agents on the porch of the neighbor's shack-like home, chatting with the residences there. Their Ion Enforcer was parked out front and their backs facing Kaedues' vehicle.


[3/9/2025 10:50 PM] Kaedues Staub
**"Undo your seatbelt and get lower than the passenger window."** *Kaedues reacts quickly to the situation. He undoes his seatbelt and reaches for the door's latch.* **"I think I know why they are here."**


[3/9/2025 10:51 PM] Sophie Donovan
She would unbuckle her seatbelt slowly. **"Can I go to the back of the van?"** She'd whisper, as if they would be able to hear her.


[3/9/2025 10:57 PM] Kaedues Staub
**"..If you think it is a better idea, you can.. but sink low first. I'll block the driver-side window, and then you can move. It will be safe that way."**
*This time, Kaedues acts under the assumption she will go along with it. He opens the door, steps outside, and closes it before pressing his back up against the cold metal plating of the door.*


[3/9/2025 11:09 PM] Sophie Donovan
She sunk low and scrambled towards the back quickly.


[3/9/2025 11:09 PM] Narration
And as soon as she shuffled her way towards the back, Kaedues barely had time to press himself against the cold metal of the van before one of the CCR lawmen shifted, his posture stiffening. A flicker of movement in his peripheral vision must have caught his attention. He turned his head just enough to glance over his shoulder, his sharp gaze locking onto Kaedues.

For a heartbeat, there was no reaction—just a moment of cold calculation as the officer’s eyes narrowed, scanning his face. Then, recognition struck. 

The officer lingered on him for a second longer than necessary, as if confirming something in his mind. Then, slowly, his lips parted, and he turned his body just enough to signal to his partner.

That is when the second officer stopped speaking with the neighbor who was now looking towards Kaedues **also** looked over. The first officer said something to the second more before they then bid farewell to the neighbor and descended down the porch steps casually.


[3/9/2025 11:14 PM] Kaedues Staub
*Kaedues leans against his van and pushes his hands in his pockets. He watches the officers, and while he does not __move__, he accesses Sophie's contact info and sends her a message.*
`If you need to know or do something, there will be another message.`

*Kaedues is a law-abiding citizen and of course waits for the nice police officers to approach him so he can help them with their problem.*


[3/9/2025 11:22 PM] Narration
The two CCR officers moved with a measured pace, their boots making soft, deliberate sounds against the cracked pavement. Their body language was casual—too casual. The first officer, the one who had recognized Kaedues, wore an easygoing smile as he approached, his hands resting lightly at his belt. He wasn't reaching for his bolster, nor was he displaying any overt signs of aggression. If anything, he carried himself like an old friend stopping by for a *chat*.....

**"Evening,"** the officer greeted, his tone smooth, conversational. **"We were just speaking with your neighbor,"** He'd point back at the neighbor who was now retreating into their home. **"asking if you were home."** His head tilted slightly, his expression open, inviting. **"Mind if we have a quick word?"**

Meanwhile, the second officer remained slightly behind and to the side, his stance just as relaxed but his eyes settling in one place for too long. He scanned the surroundings with a subtle, practiced ease, taking in everything—the van, the road which they could've approached from (which had to be from their backs....), the windows of nearby buildings. His gaze liongered on the vehicle for just a second longer than necessary before flicking towards the conversation the first officer and Kaedues were now having...


[3/9/2025 11:29 PM] Kaedues Staub
*Externally, Kaedues remains completely plain and neutral. The way he looks at anyone could make them feel like they are being seen through; The black dots in his eyes lock onto the face of the officer in front of him.*
*Internally, there are a myriad situations beginning to play out to Kaedues; though they have not reached anywhere yet.*


[3/9/2025 11:30 PM] Kaedues Staub
**"What do you want?"** *He asks promptly. The question is purposefully direct, but lacks the spite or bite of someone who might be defensive.*


[3/9/2025 11:34 PM] Narration
The officer let out a small chuckle, as if Kaedues' straightforwardness was amusing rather than off-putting. **"Nothing major,"** he said, his tone still light. **"We just had a couple of questions. You see, we spoke to a young woman yesterday?? Yeah, yesterday—we were curious about how you two know each other. At first, I thought you might be sibilings but neither of you resemble the other."**

The second officer, still watching their surroundings, subtly shifted his stance. His gaze lingered on the van again, as if expecting something—or someone—to reveal itself.


[3/9/2025 11:54 PM] Kaedues Staub
*Kaedues happens to align with what happens, but it does not change how he consciously perceives it happening--witnesses it. The hypothetical positions that begun to play out in his head immediately begin to branch out, multiply and converge. Possible actions, probable results and risks associated with playing into any one of these.. narratives.*

*(The only way to get out of this without a hitch is for my answer to align completely with every piece of dialogue they heard.)*

*Kaedues looks off to the second officer for a brief moment. His head turns with a deliberate slowness. This isn't a glance that is being snuck. His eyes and head move back to the first officer.*

**"..Oh."** *Kaedues rolls his eyes, sighs, and pinches the bridge of his nose. After an exasperated moment, he lets his arms fall to his sides again.*
*(This is something that 'I' am asked often, given the alibi I want to present. I do look nothing like her.)*
**"No.."** *Kaedues says with a breath in,* **"we are not siblings."** *He continues on the breath out.*
**"She is my daughter. Gets all of her looks from her mother's side."**


[3/10/2025 12:01 AM] Narration
The first officer raised his brows slightly, as if intrigued by the revelation. **"Huh. That so? Guess that explains a thing or two..."** He rubbed his chin thoughtfully, then tiltd his head ever so slightly. **"Mind if we ask where her mother is these days?"**

The second officer, still maintaining his casual stance, had adjusted his positioning just enough to be closer to the van. His eyes flicked towards the rear, subtle but intentional. He wasn't looking directly, but he was making his presence known. It was a move designed to unsettle, to suggest that if there was anything to be found, it would be.


[3/10/2025 12:08 AM] Kaedues Staub
**"She lives in Littleton,"** *Kaedues responds promptly. He watches as quite a few of the narratives converge together with his answer.*
*The urge to look at the second officer, to watch him, strikes Kaedues. He does not, though. In fact, something else tells him not to. It would break the narrative to do this, to react defensively or to appear nervous in any way.*


[3/10/2025 12:34 AM] Narration
The first officer nodded slowly, his expression still relaxed but his gaze sharpened. **"Littleton, huh? You two travel often? Or is this just a temporary arrangement like a uhh, custody issue?"**

The second officer, seemingly disinterested, crouched slightly, inspecting a scuff mark  near the bottom edge of the van (from one of the many potholes that graced the vehicle's bumper). His eyes betrayed his curiosity. He was piecing something together in his head, though he hadn't voiced it yet.


[3/10/2025 12:42 AM] Kaedues Staub
**"Depends on what you call often."** *Kaedues glances down to his side, and reaches into his pocket.* **"She's swapped between us, on-again off-again. Once a week."** *He responds punctually, again. Intertwining lines created both of symbolic color and relevant words or criteria float around in Kaedues' headspace like strands of yarn on water, most of which moving in the same direction.*

*This sequence of events, so far, aligns. It does not feel rewarding. There is more work to do.*


[3/10/2025 12:47 AM] Narration
The second officer exhales quietly through his nose and glances at his partner. The first officer, still smiling, gives a small almost imperceptible nod. There is a moment of quiet between them, an unspoken exchange that Kaedues might pick up on. 

**"Alright then,"** the first officer finally says, his voice still as amicable as before. **"Seems like everything checks out. Just doing our due diligence, you understand."**

The second officer lingers a second longer before stepping back from the van, his gaze sweeping over Kaedues one last time. He doesn't say anything, but you know damn well his presence speaks volumes.

**"You take care now,"** the first officer continues, tipping his head slightly. **"Stay out of trouble."** With that, the two officers turn away, the two exchanged words with one another as they return to their Ion Enforcer.


[3/10/2025 12:59 AM] Kaedues Staub
*Kaedues watches the agents move to the enforcer. Somehow, even though it looks like they are leaving, Kaedues doesn't feel any closure. He looks up at the sky and reaches into his pocket, pulling out his packet of caffeinated gum. He takes only a few moments to retrieve a stick from the pack and begin chewing...*
-# *It is all falling apart.*
*All of the talk has led you to a binary split. Either they leave, or they wait until you walk inside and search the van.*
-# *It is all falling apart.*
*Staying outside the van like this is reason enough for a lawman from Haven Heights to pull the suspicion card.*
-# *It is all falling apart.*
*He chews the gum. He feels the substance against his teeth. Tough. Rubbery. A little flaky, at first. He distracts himself on purpose.*


[3/10/2025 1:05 AM] Narration
The low blue glow of the Enforcer’s lights washes over the pavement as it idles. The officers remain inside, watching, waiting—long enough to let him know they are in no rush. 

Eventually, after what feels like an eternity, the Enforcer’s brake lights flicker. The hum of the engine rises slightly as it shifts into motion. Then, slowly, the vehicle pulls away, disappearing around the corner.


[3/10/2025 1:11 AM] Kaedues Staub
*Kaedues takes a breath in and moves toward the front of the van. He shoots Sophie a text as he wanders around the front.*
*`They are not here right now. Come out through the passenger side door.`*


[3/10/2025 1:13 AM] Kaedues Staub
*He opens the door himself, actually, with a deliberate slowness and silence.*


[3/10/2025 1:14 AM] Narration
The van shifted as Sophie walked towards the cabin of the van and out the passenger side of the door. She hopped out, and looked around.


[3/10/2025 1:14 AM] Sophie Donovan
**"I recongized that voice... The lawmen from yesterday morning."** She remarked, looking around before settling her gaze upon Kaedues.


[3/10/2025 1:17 AM] Kaedues Staub
*Kaedues closes the door with the same deliberate slowness. It hardly makes a sound at all.*
**"Did you look in the box?"** *He asks. Now, he moves toward his front door. He opens it and walks inside, leaving it open for Sophie.*


[3/10/2025 1:18 AM] Sophie Donovan
**"The box? No, I didn't want to move around and make noise."** Sophie responded, entering the house with her clothes in tow.


[3/10/2025 1:24 AM] Kaedues Staub
*Kaedues lets out an almost imperceptible sound with his mouth caused by his tongue seperating from the insides of his cheeks.*
**"..The story I gave them is one of the only ones that lines up with what they know about you and me. It needs to stay that way, otherwise we will stand out more than we already do."**

*He approaches his sink now.*


[3/10/2025 1:30 AM] Sophie Donovan
**"That I am your daughter?"** She closed the door and look over her shoulder towards Kaedues as he approached the sink.


[3/10/2025 1:34 AM] Kaedues Staub
**"Yes. That's not all, either. There is a loose end I need to tie together now."** *Kaedues glances down at Sophie, and then at the sink. He reaches toward the other end of the basin and grabs an old sponge. It is used, but clean.* **"..Use hot water. As hot as your hands can handle without feeling like they are burning."** *He hands the sponge to Sophie now.*


[3/10/2025 4:32 PM] Sophie Donovan
Sophie clutched the sponge and looked down at it. Even the sponge looked like it could use a wash of its own despite being clean... Do these people __really__ live like this? A question in which she asked herself countless times since coming here.

With the sponge in one hand and clothes in the other. Sophie more careful than she really needed to—sat the pile of clothes on the counter next to the basin and would turn on the hot water.

Another blow to Sophie's privielged life is that just a fraction of a second later, she went to check if the water was hot in which case, it was ice cold.. Her hand retracted instinctively. **"It's cold."** She remarked as if it was broken.


[3/10/2025 4:37 PM] Kaedues Staub
**"The water takes a minute or two to heat up down here."** *Kaedues thinks to himself for another moment.* **"Don't ever drink the hot tap water. Cold is better, though if we're being honest you should boil it."**


[3/10/2025 4:41 PM] Sophie Donovan
**"Ok."** She watched the low pressure faucet move water down the drain. Sophie kept the sponge in her hand and waited for a while before checking it again with her finger.

Lukewarm.... Alright, lets continue to wait then...


[3/10/2025 4:43 PM] Kaedues Staub
**"The agents you heard earlier are likely to be trailing us for a while,"** *Kaedues brings up a casual small-talk conversation to pass the time.* **"You need to choose a different name to be called in public."**


[3/10/2025 4:43 PM] Sophie Donovan
**"Just don't call for me, then."** She blinked and gazed in his direction before blinking once more—returning her focus on the faucet.


[3/10/2025 4:44 PM] Kaedues Staub
**"Wrong."**


[3/10/2025 4:45 PM] Sophie Donovan
**"Don't know how that is __wrong__."** She'd remark, closing her eyes and pulling her lips off to one side momentiarly.


[3/10/2025 4:47 PM] Kaedues Staub
**"It is more than realistic that your name will be asked by many people. Declining to answer is suspicious to the lawmen down here. Down here, they are looking for an __excuse__ to arrest you. They don't need a reason."** *Kaedues piles on a few reasons why, one after the other, all in a line.*


[3/10/2025 4:48 PM] Kaedues Staub
**"If you do not tell them exactly what they want to hear, it will spoil before you have a chance to explain yourself."**


[3/10/2025 4:50 PM] Sophie Donovan
**"Can't I just use my middle name?"**


[3/10/2025 4:51 PM] Kaedues Staub
**"Middle name? You have three?"** *Kaedues' eyes trail to her face for a second, and then return to the faucet.*


[3/10/2025 4:54 PM] Sophie Donovan
**"Yeah.."** Steam began to roll off from the bottom of the basin, giving her a clear indication that the water was now ready. **"It's dumb, but I think its better than what anyone else could come up with."** She would take her grey t-shirt and toss it into the sink.


[3/10/2025 4:55 PM] Kaedues Staub
**"You'll have to pretend it is actually your first name."**


[3/10/2025 4:56 PM] Kaedues Staub
**"What is your middle name?"** *He'd go on to ask.*


[3/10/2025 5:00 PM] Sophie Donovan
**"Charlee."** She began to scrub the clothes within the basin. The way she went about it was goofy. Acting as if the water was going to kill her if she got a single drop on her hands. She placed effort in avoiding the water itself—rolling and folding this way and that.


[3/10/2025 5:05 PM] Kaedues Staub
*Kaedues watches her as she rolls the clothes around in the water.. He gets the instinctual urge to tell her what to do. This is very far from correct, and the correct way of doing things isn't hard. Just do it right.*

*He blinks very slowly, resigning himself.*
*(This won't work for her. She would sooner give up.) He just watches her. It's hard to watch.*
**"Charlee works well. If you have to give a last name, say 'Staub'."** *The 'b' sound in Staub is sharper than other words that might use it.*


[3/10/2025 5:09 PM] Sophie Donovan
**"Sta__b__..."**


[3/10/2025 5:10 PM] Kaedues Staub
**"..No, Staub."** *This has happened a few times before. He doesn't think anything of correcting people who mispronounce the word.*


[3/11/2025 11:04 AM] Sophie Donovan
**"…..Stawb"**


[3/11/2025 11:53 AM] Kaedues Staub
**"No, not that either. Staub."** *He repeats himself.*


[3/11/2025 8:33 PM] Sophie Donovan
She glanced over towards him quizzically then shook her head in frustration. Her sponge hand went down into the sink and she began scrubbing the t-shirt. **"Whatever.."**


[3/11/2025 8:35 PM] Kaedues Staub
*Kaedues fights himself on trying to direct her now. It's more than obvious she is still confused, but.. it's not even the end of it.* **"If it looks clean and smells clean, then it is clean."**


[3/11/2025 8:36 PM] Sophie Donovan
**"I wouldn't consider it clean with how bad the hot water smells."** She grimaced, really disturbing the flow of water as she scrubbed. This was torture!!!!


[3/11/2025 8:53 PM] Kaedues Staub
**"It's calcium. Runoff stone that builds up in the pipes."** *Kaedues mentions.* **"When you dry them, all of that will come off."**


[3/11/2025 9:27 PM] Narration
After several minutes of intense scrubbing, Sophie moved on to her jacket. The entire process took Sophie approximately 20 minutes until she called it quits. 

The articles of clothing were sopping wet and just looking at the drenched clothes made Sophie cringe. Not in a million years, would she had expected to wash her clothes by hand.


[3/11/2025 9:27 PM] Sophie Donovan
**"I'm done."** She announced.


[3/11/2025 9:32 PM] Kaedues Staub
**"...They look good. Nice work."** *He reaches into the sink and picks up the jacket. Seeing as she went and did the scrubbing, he figures it isn't a bad idea to wring them out.*

*The clothing, starting with the jacket and finishing with the shirt, is wrung out by hand. Kaedues coils the articles into very tightly-wound spirals that expel the water trapped inside vigorously. After only a minute or two, they are left damp and hanging off the side of the sink. Next, Kaedues reaches up and opens a nearby cupboard to pull a towel from. He holds one out to Sophie.* **"I'll help you dry them. Once you get changed, we have an errand to run. And you need to eat."**


[3/11/2025 9:39 PM] Sophie Donovan
Sophie takes the towel from Kaedues and begins drying the shirt. **"Do you do this often? You know, washing your clothes by hand?"** She asked the question mindlessly as she continued her task.


[3/11/2025 9:41 PM] Kaedues Staub
*The corners of Kaedues' mouth turn up. That question is so..*
**"Only when I want to walk outside with clean clothes,"** *He answers after a moment to stew on it.*


[3/11/2025 9:47 PM] Sophie Donovan
**"Mn."** Her eyes shifted towards Kaedues' chest. Particularly, the flashdrive around his neck. **"What's that for?"** Her eyes pointing for her.


[3/11/2025 9:49 PM] Kaedues Staub
**"It's a music playlist."** *He reaches into the cupboard again and pulls out his own towel so he can dry the jacket.* **"I've had it since.."** *He pauses for a time, likely piecing together the exact when and where.* **"..Forever ago."**


[3/11/2025 9:54 PM] Sophie Donovan
**"I see."** Sophie held the shirt up in the dim amber light provided from the ceiling light. It was dry enough for her, she thought. There has been times where she had to wear damp clothes when she was running late for school. 

A glance over her shoulder would present a bathroom she could use.


[3/11/2025 9:58 PM] Kaedues Staub
**"Go ahead and get changed."** *Kaedues flips the gum in his mouth over, continuing to chew.* **"I'll be here."**


[3/11/2025 9:59 PM] Sophie Donovan
She would acquire the jacket as well and with one final look towards Kaedues' direction she would vanish into the bathroom for a time.


[3/11/2025 10:06 PM] Narration
**"...."**


[3/11/2025 10:06 PM] Sophie Donovan
Sophie then emerged from the bathroom wearing her *slightly* damp clothes, keeping her jeans as they were since they were not necessarily out of place. As she closed the door, she turned back around. Her hair was neatly trimmed around the entire circumference of her head; a Hime-like cut.

However, she was not going to keep it like that. No, she splayed her fingers and scooped her hair that weren't her bangs and pulled it up to tie it off for a ponytail.


[3/11/2025 10:07 PM] Sophie Donovan
Kaeudes could tell by the look on her face that she wasn't really liking what she was wearing. But, it was a compromise as the situation called for it.


[3/11/2025 10:10 PM] Kaedues Staub
*When Sophie emerges from the bathroom, she can see Kaedues holding his flash drive up to his face. He's inspecting it.*
*A quiet moment occurs like this. On one side of the drive, there's an engraving marked in red; The letter K. On the other side, an engraving marked in white; another K.*

-# **"Who made this type of drive, again?"** *He mutters to himself.*


[3/11/2025 10:16 PM] Sophie Donovan
**"I'm ready."** She mumbles to Kaedues, standing by the front door.


[3/11/2025 10:18 PM] Kaedues Staub
*Without another missed beat, Kaedues allows the drive to fall to his chest. He walks outside first.* **"You look like a local."**
*First, he looks around his doorway to see if anyone's there, and then he walks to the driver's side door and opens it up.*


[3/11/2025 10:22 PM] Sophie Donovan
**"I don't consider that a compliment."** Sophie retorted. Waiting for Kaedues to check if the coast was clear and then followed him out to the van.


[3/11/2025 10:26 PM] Kaedues Staub
*Before he leaves the doorway, Kaedues turns halfway to look at Sophie. His expression isn't neutral anymore. It's not angry, or tense either.. it's a sad middleground between sour and frustrated. She didn't have to say that.*

*After only a second or two, he continues forward to the van, going through with the process like the last post dictated. He starts the van in advance and unlocks the door for Sophie.* **"It's open."**


[3/11/2025 10:28 PM] Sophie Donovan
Sophie climbed into the van, closing the door once she plopped down into the seat. **"What is it you need to do anyways?"** Referring to this errand he mentioned earlier.


[3/11/2025 10:29 PM] Kaedues Staub
**"Find the woman who will be posing as your mother."** *He buckles in and peels out of the driveway. Focusing on that task at hand distracts him from her comment, and the tension, and.. a little more.*


[3/11/2025 10:32 PM] Sophie Donovan
**"Do you really think they would go as far as to verify all of that?"** She'd ask, looking into his direction as the infrequent street lamp raced acrossed the top of the van.


[3/11/2025 10:37 PM] Kaedues Staub
**"Out of the 16 most probable ways these officers will decide to handle the matter, I am predicting that 5 of them involve us being investigated like this."** *He explains.* **"It is not likely. If they do it, and I don't have the proof, they will know I am lying."** *..he continues.*

**"Lying about something there is little reason to lie about in the first place. From that point, it would become obvious that you are someone of interest. They would have reason enough to give us the hassle."** *Kaedues breathes in and out and makes a left turn.* **"Then it all falls apart."**
-# *It is all falling apart. The earlier sentiment appears in Kaedues' head again, and sends a particularly disgusting wave of cold up his spine.*


[3/11/2025 10:40 PM] Kaedues Staub
**"I made the claim to be your father to prove why I am spending time with you, but if these officers are concerned about your safety or are just looking for time to kill they will want to prove me wrong. I have a person in mind who fits the profile and is..."** *He pauses for a moment.* **"likely in need of help."**


[3/11/2025 10:51 PM] Sophie Donovan
**"And if they don't?"**


[3/11/2025 10:52 PM] Kaedues Staub
**"Then it will be a waste of time."**


[3/11/2025 10:56 PM] Sophie Donovan
There was not much else for Sophie to go off of from Kaedues' response. It was realistic and straight to the point. A part of her expected him to clam up and not have an answer... She should know better by now—the short amount of time she had around this man would give her an idea.

Sophie returned her gaze towards the road ahead of them. **"How do you intend on finding this woman? Did she give you her number or something?"**


[3/11/2025 11:00 PM] Kaedues Staub
**"I gave her mine as a gesture of courtesy. Told her to call if rent money fell through."** *Kaedues focuses solely on the road ahead.* **"She did not give me hers. We have to find her the hard way."**

*The van rolls over a pothole, causing a small bump in the ride.* **"The clothing she wears matches the general makeup of clothes popular to wear in Littleton. It's almost impossible she isn't from there."**


[3/11/2025 11:03 PM] Sophie Donovan
**"Do I have to do this too?"** She complained, sound like she was whining.


[3/11/2025 11:05 PM] Kaedues Staub
*Kaedues takes a slow breath in to his lungs.. and then empties them with that same slowness. There is no noise, no audible frustration or contempt.*
**"Yes."**


[3/11/2025 11:13 PM] Sophie Donovan
She would groan, planting her elbow on the passenger arm rest and letting her head fall into her palm.


[3/11/2025 11:14 PM] Kaedues Staub
*He continues the drive to Littleton.*

[3/15/2025 11:06 PM] Kaedues Staub
*Once Kaedues pulled into his driveway, it dawns on him. That exhausted feeling hits him like a sack of bricks as soon as he reaches for his seatbelt to undo it..*

**"..Mn."** *He mumbles softly. Instead of getting out of the van, he climbs into the loading bay.*
*(If I wasn't about to.. spend all of this money, I could buy a mattress..)*
*Come to think of it, that idea invites another thought.*
*(I wonder how Danny is doing.)*

*He sits down, resting his back against the wall of the bay..*

*`At first, it is a feeling of cold. Subtle and tense, like walking through a change in atmosphere.`*
*`The darkness mirrors that cold. It is a world without heat. A world without warmth. Really, it is nothing at all. The absence of everything. It is not an unfamiliar or uncomfortable feeling.`*

*`Without warning, the void splits open. Color floods in, ambient noise and the chatter of persons in a confined space filter through. Kaedues' eyes open.`*
*`He is standing in a kind of place that is not unfamiliar. A small corner store, maybe-- The stale smell in the air and the shelves that loosely align themselves in Kaedues' peripheral vision could point to that. So could the man in front of him, behind the counter.`*

*`Oh.. Oh. It's not a corner store. The realization comes late. The space around Kaedues is a pawn shop. That would explain why he is being waited on.`*
*`He looks down. With only a little inspection, he finds that he had already prepared something to sell. Thin, small; About the size of his thumbtip and half as thick. Sleek black with a simple branding. A shard.`*

**`"Sorry.. Choom."`** *`He says flatly. Another moment of silence passes before he realizes he is still being prompted.`*
**`"I am interested in exchanging this with you."`** *`Kaedues pushes his hand forward, showing the man behind the counter the shard he had prepared. It sits sandwiched between his index finger and thumb.`*


[3/16/2025 1:50 AM] N̸̼̊ar̵r̵̦͑a̴̎t̶o̶͕͑r
*`Naturally, the vendor reaches forward and grabs hold of the drive between Kaedues' fingers. He pulls at it to take it into his own hands, but it doesn't break free of the redhead's grip.`*

*`After another tug, the corners of the vendor's lips pinch. A sign of annoyance, or frustration.`*
**`"Okay, what the fuck are we doing here?"`**


[3/16/2025 1:50 AM] Kaedues Staub
**`"Five thousand, five hundred micros."`** *`Kaedues speaks firmly. Given the context, it's clear that this is a price offer. However, the way Kaedues says this out loud sounds more like a declaration, or an order if you were the assumptive type.`*


[3/16/2025 1:50 AM] N̸̼̊ar̵r̵̦͑a̴̎t̶o̶͕͑r
*`The vendor takes a deep breath in and out without removing his hands from the shard.`*
**`"I don't know where you come from pal, but in this shop nothing gets sold without a once-over from me. If you want *any* money, let me see the shard."`**


[3/16/2025 1:50 AM] Kaedues Staub
**`"Understood."`** *`Kaedues replies promptly. He releases the shard.`*


[3/16/2025 1:50 AM] N̸̼̊ar̵r̵̦͑a̴̎t̶o̶͕͑r
**`"..Huh. Never seen this kind of brand before."`** *`The vendor shrugs after inspecting it. He plugs it into some kind of machine behind the counter.`*
**`"Okay, K-Shard. Let's see.."`** *`After a moment, the vendor rolls his eyes.`* **`"..You want to pawn this off for five thousand? It only has music on it, choom."`**


[3/16/2025 1:50 AM] Kaedues Staub
*`Kaedues swallows instinctively. This sounds like a natural way for a dialogue to play out, but it also feels strange. Incongruent.`* **`"I know what it is worth. I had it appraised already."`**

*`(Wait.. did I? Why did I say that?)`*


[3/16/2025 1:50 AM] N̸̼̊ar̵r̵̦͑a̴̎t̶o̶͕͑r
**`"..Look, choom. I ain't a collector. You shoulda had the person who appraised it first buy it."`** *`He scratches the back of his neck, and takes a look at a display monitor next to the machine he plugged the shard into. His eyes squint for a moment.`*
**`"But.. I'm feeling generous. Three K. Sound fair to you?"`**


[3/16/2025 1:50 AM] Kaedues Staub
**`"That's half my asking price."`**


[3/16/2025 1:50 AM] N̸̼̊ar̵r̵̦͑a̴̎t̶o̶͕͑r
**"Retail price for these things is like 500, tops. Take your pick."**


[3/16/2025 1:50 AM] Kaedues Staub
*`Kaedues looks down at himself. His eyebrows furrow. Something is wrong, but he doesn't know what. Is it his..`*
*`His left hand. It's restored. No.. That's an understatement. It's clean. Not smooth, but not grisly and rough like he knows them. What's more, there is an absence around his neck. He looks over the counter..`*

*`(Am I.. selling my flashdrive? That makes no sense. I don't remember that..)`*
*`It comes to him naturally now. He presses his index finger and thumb together..`*


[3/16/2025 1:50 AM] N̸̼̊ar̵r̵̦͑a̴̎t̶o̶͕͑r
*`Where he would expect a pinch, there is none. He feels nothing. No pain, no discomfort.. no sound, no texture..`*

[*`No sound?`*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ufM1nw1s4yI)

*`..No sound. The ambient noise and idle chatter of the peoples inside the pawn shop have disappeared..`*

[3/16/2025 1:50 AM] Kaedues Staub
*`(I can't believe I was going to sell it.)`*
**`"Actually, I changed my mind. I want it back."`** *`Kaedues says with a forward hand gesture.`*


[3/16/2025 1:50 AM] N̸̼̊ar̵r̵̦͑a̴̎t̶o̶͕͑r
*`No response from the man behind the counter. Actually.. with Kaedues' attention directed to him, it becomes obvious that he is no longer moving. His position is held still, halfway through a blink.`*


[3/16/2025 1:50 AM] Kaedues Staub
**`"Um.. okay.."`** *`Kaedues grimaces a little. He just.. reaches over the counter and takes the drive. It does nothing to provoke the man from his strangely frozen state.`*

*`With that said and done, Kaedues turns around and takes a step toward the entrance of the store. His eyes narrow now, focusing on the glass doors leading outside.`*


[3/16/2025 1:50 AM] N̸̼̊ar̵r̵̦͑a̴̎t̶o̶͕͑r
*`Beyond the reflective panes that comprise most of the thin grey doors is a profound darkness. The space beyond is seemingly devoid of light. The radiant beams coming from the fixtures above Kaedues do not reach the space beyond the glass.`*


[3/16/2025 1:51 AM] Kaedues Staub
*`Kaedues himself freezes now, pausing in his stride toward the door. For some time, this feels new, foreign, alien.`*
*`He takes another step forward. Yes, the darkness feels foreign and unheard of, unsighted.. but he knows it is not. He's seen something like it before.`*

*`Now, he walks forward. His boots make no noise against the stone floor on the way. When he reaches out and grasps the metal hand rail, it is not cold. It is not smooth.. It has no defining texture, or temperature, or weight. With a push the door opens. It rotates 90 degrees on its hinges, starting and stopping instantly like something out of a video game.`*

*`He walks forward. Out into the darkness.`*


[3/16/2025 1:51 AM] N̸̼̊ar̵r̵̦͑a̴̎t̶o̶͕͑r
*`His boots touch down on something that is not stone. It is not tile, or hardwood, or gravel. It's soft, almost plush but not quite. His own weight strains the floor beneath him, causing it to compress and feel firmer.`*

*`Now that he is surrounded by it, Kaedues realizes the outside is not quite as dark after all. A very faint light from overhead casts down, illuminating the floor just barely enough to see.`*


[3/16/2025 1:51 AM] Kaedues Staub
*`Kaedues looks left and right, and then up..`*


[3/16/2025 1:51 AM] N̸̼̊ar̵r̵̦͑a̴̎t̶o̶͕͑r
*`There is clearly an overhead light, but the source of which isn't visible.`*


[3/16/2025 1:51 AM] Kaedues Staub
*`Now Kaedues looks down at his feet.`*


[3/16/2025 1:51 AM] N̸̼̊ar̵r̵̦͑a̴̎t̶o̶͕͑r
*`The first thing that comes to notice is the way this light outside interacts with his body. The floor is covered in that gentle light, and the sky too-- just enough to see-- but Kaedues himself is completely blacked out. He can only see himself by comparing his silhouette to the space in front of him, only marginally brighter.`*

*`Looking down, Kaedues can see.. something that looks like bristles from a brush on the ground. Aluminum-grey blades of this foreign, pliable material rise to his ankles.`*


[3/16/2025 1:51 AM] Kaedues Staub
*`Kaedues crouches down, and looks closer at the bristles. They look vaguely similar to the 'plant' that Aurora had him take care of.`*


[3/16/2025 1:51 AM] N̸̼̊ar̵r̵̦͑a̴̎t̶o̶͕͑r
*`A voice cuts in from behind Kaedues, cutting through his short break to stop and feel the plants.`*
**`"You look dried out, eisenwanze. Tourist trap's the other way!"`**


[3/16/2025 1:51 AM] Kaedues Staub
*`(Eisenwanze..?)`*
-# *`(Iron.. bug?)`*

*`Kaedues tilts his head back and due left. His eyes veer hard to one side, forwarding a suspicious look to whoever said that.`*


[3/16/2025 1:51 AM] Snarky Figure
*`It's a man, or at least it's the silhouette of a man. Every single defining feature he could have is obscured by the profound brightness that he.. is.`*
*`His hair, his skin, his clothes.. they are all a pristine, pure white that makes discerning any details particularly difficult. However, one thing in particular stands out.`*

*`Circles where the eyes would be cut through the silhouette, leaving behind a black holes of their own. Little markings surround the cardinal directions of these holes like notches in a clock.`*

**`"I already know I'm gorgeous, choom. If you want to look for much longer, it's gonna have to start costin' something."`** *`With his features perfectly blending into one another, it's impossible to see his lips move, or his jaw rise and fall.`*


[3/16/2025 1:52 AM] Kaedues Staub
*`Kaedues rolls his eyes and stands up, then pivots on his heel to properly face.. that.`*
**`"What is this?"`** *`Kaedues looks around himself again, especially at the strange kind of plant that gathers everywhere on the ground.`*


[3/16/2025 1:52 AM] Snarky Figure
**`"Easy there. Command language only, or we're both gonna have a bad time."`** *`The figure responds swiftly. It leans back and places its hands at its hips. Maybe his hands are in his pockets, or he is putting on an arrogant poise.`*


[3/16/2025 1:52 AM] Kaedues Staub
**`"Command language?"`**


[3/16/2025 1:52 AM] Snarky Figure
**`"--Nicht! That. Don't do that."`**


[3/16/2025 1:52 AM] Kaedues Staub
*`Kaedues' face contorts in confusion and outright frustration. Whatever this thing wants is both unclear and unknown to Staub..`*
**`"Don't do what? What are you talking about?"`**


[3/16/2025 1:52 AM] Snarky Figure
**`"Ask questions, dumb fuck! Like I said, command language. Look, if you'd just come over here--"`** *`He begins to say..`*


[3/16/2025 1:52 AM] Kaedues Staub
**`"Where is this?"`** *`Kaedues promptly asks. He looks up at what would be the sky.`*


[3/16/2025 1:52 AM] Snarky Figure
*`An exasperated groan rumbles out from the figure's throat just as Kaedues finishes asking. His head tilts back at the same time, only emphasizing what could only be perceived as frustration.`*

*`The figure's hands swiftly rise to grip his own head of hair. He rattles his own skull around while he yells out,`*
**`"You're being so fucking difficullllll-tuhhh!!!"`** *`The man practically lashes out at the air with his vigorous shaking! He swats his hands down to his sides.`*


[3/16/2025 1:52 AM] Kaedues Staub
*`Kaedues' eyes flick left and right. Seeing this guy tweak out creates an awkward feeling, even for Kaedues.`*
**`"Are you.. done?"`**


[3/16/2025 1:52 AM] Snarky Figure
**`"Scheiße, it's like clearing a jammed chamber with you.."`** *`Now, the silhouette paces back and forth once. He turns to face Kaedues again promptly.`* **`"Do I have to spell it out for you? Stop fucking talking!"`**


[3/16/2025 1:52 AM] Kaedues Staub
*`Kaedues tries to take a breath and restrain himself, but honestly the way this guy talks and especially the way his grainy, guttural voice scrapes against his ears like a fork on a chalkboard stops that from happening at all.`*
**`"Why? Why the fuck should I listen to you? Who--"`**

[3/16/2025 1:52 AM] Kaedues Staub
*Surprisingly, Kaedues wakes up without a start. His eyes open, and he is in the same position he was in when he went to sleep. He doesn't feel particularly well-rested.. but some will have to do better than none at all.*


[3/16/2025 2:01 AM] Narration
Kaedues' system would initialize the wake-up sequence completely. At this point, any notifications he received would be put on hold. As fate would have it, he received two notifications. One was from an unknown source, and the other was from none other than Doug.


[3/16/2025 2:03 AM] Kaedues Staub
*(Oh. That's convenient. I wanted to talk to him, anyway.)*
*He opens Doug's message first and reads it.*


[3/16/2025 2:03 AM] Doug
`"Call me."` Is all it says.


[3/16/2025 2:04 AM] Narration
With Doug sending the message, Kaedues now had a directly link to call him.


[3/16/2025 2:04 AM] Kaedues Staub
*Before he commits to anything like that, Kaedues goes ahead and opens the message from the unknown source.*


[3/16/2025 2:06 AM] Narration
`"Congratulations, you've been hired to work for Loft Logistics at our distribution center in Kapea! Unfortunately, your start date has been pushed back to Wednesday. We expect to see you there at 9 AM!"` His acceptance message for Loft Logistics.


[3/16/2025 2:06 AM] Kaedues Staub
*Oh. That's.. that could be a good thing.*
*Anyway, Kaedues goes ahead and calls Doug.*


[3/16/2025 2:08 AM] Doug
`"You're awake, how's Sophie doin'?"` He asked immediately.


[3/16/2025 2:11 AM] Kaedues Staub
**"Just woke up a second ago, so I don't know. Hold on."** *Kaedues gets up and out of the van. He moves to enter his house and verify that Sophie is asleep.* **"I'm running into trouble with laying low. Some reg lawmen who need to meet a quota, I am pretty sure.. but they are following me."**


[3/16/2025 2:12 AM] Sophie Donovan
Sophie was awake, blankly staring off towards the back of the house. The door opened to her right, prompting her to glance towards Kaedues. She was watching something. Her eyes were illuminated before flickering off as she blinked. **"..."** She didn't say hello or anything, just looked at him.


[3/16/2025 2:14 AM] Doug
`"Damn it, mate. That's no good... Did you get a read on their plates? Badge numbers? Anything?"`


[3/16/2025 2:17 AM] Kaedues Staub
*Kaedues nods to Sophie.* **"..No. That's a good idea. I was preoccupied with making an alibi, and we have one."** *Kaedues' eyebrows lower.* **"Come to think of it, I noticed a big rig near where we stopped for an outing last night. It was dark.. but it could have been those guys."**

*Kaedues turns around and looks at the hood of his van.* **"Right now, I can manage. I have something I need to ask you, though."**


[3/16/2025 2:18 AM] Doug
`"Asking the man which you broke the nose of a favor..."` There was a sigh to segment his train of thought. `"What is it?"`


[3/16/2025 2:22 AM] Kaedues Staub
**"..If I wasn't able to figure you out when we met, I wouldn't be here right now. I don't know you, or anyone you work with. If it happens again, I don't want to look incriminating. I don't have another line of questions to spin."**

*He pauses for a brief moment and punctuates his little expose with the question aforementioned.* **"If I find another one of you, is there something I can say to vouch for myself?"**


[3/16/2025 6:24 PM] Doug
`"I don't know choom. It depends on __who__ you come across—and throwing names around will only incriminate you more."`

`"I'll tell you what, I will let my people know of you. So that way, their eyes are open. Aside from that, we don't have any code words or phrases. That shit bit us in the ass last time."`


[3/16/2025 6:50 PM] Kaedues Staub
**"That works for me. If you want an update, call the number."**
*A sigh escapes him.* **"I'll make sure she gets to you, as long as you were serious about the 'couple of weeks' thing."**


[3/16/2025 6:54 PM] Doug
`"Yeah, I am serious. If we don't get Sophie to my man, then we both are going to be on the receiving end of something worse."`

Doug paused, contemplating whether he really wanted to let Kaedues in on a tidbit.
`"I don't know if you know anything about what's going on at the high level of District 9. But if I were you, I'd start collecting any weapon and gear you can get.`

`"You weren't packing iron. If you didn't get that firm, I suggest you get one and keep it on you."`

[3/16/2025 7:32 PM] Kaedues Staub
*Kaedues steps backwards into his house and looks over at Sophie.. or well, more like he regards her. Just to keep her in line of sight.*
**"You want me to __arm myself__? That makes me look hostile to my clients. I don't need to scare off anyone else."** *His eyes unfocus, looking past Sophie at the wall.*
*(..No, that's not right.) Kaedues thinks to himself, but a more pressing idea comes to light before he finishes the smaller thought.*
**"Is this about that firmware that we are supposed to be getting?"**


[3/16/2025 7:34 PM] Kaedues Staub
*The way his voice sounds outward.. it's almost defensive.*


[3/16/2025 10:15 PM] Doug
`"Frankly, fuck your clients. You have Donovan's eldest, and if shit hits the fan before we can get her to Danny AND you're caught with your pants down, then you ain't the guy to be taking care of her."`

`"A war is coming. The firmware is only the catalyst for more significant problems, mate. Pack Iron. Keep it in your van if you need to. Come see me in two days from now, I'll tell you all that you need to know since you are in this shit along with us."`


[3/16/2025 10:31 PM] Kaedues Staub
*There is not an immediate response from Kaedues' end. The sound of him swallowing barely picks up over the audio recording; enough feedback to at least know he is there and likely heard.*

*There is a particular.. grain of the mind Kaedues experiences in the second or so before he speaks. There's an implication behind what Doug said that Kaedues doesn't fully understand, and that isn't even the half of it.*

**"Right. I'll be there."** *He replies, and his eyes refocus onto Sophie's face. He hangs up, takes another second to register his contact information, and promptly speaks up.*
**"Did something happen?"**


[3/16/2025 11:59 PM] Sophie Donovan
Sophie blinked, closing her eyes sharply as she yawned. After it had passed, she shook her head. **"No. Morning was uneventful."**


[3/17/2025 12:38 AM] Kaedues Staub
*Kaedues looks down at her for a few more seconds, and then he paces once or twice away from Sophie. He sits down and rests his back against an empty section of wall.* **"Alright. Turns out, we don't need to go to where I mentioned yesterday. I need a few minutes. To [think.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f86lz8-zNIo)"**

[3/17/2025 12:38 AM] Kaedues Staub
*Kaedues crosses his legs and rests his elbows on his knees. He laces his fingers together and closes his eyes..*
*It only lasts a moment. He retrieves his hands and crosses his arms. That only lasts a moment, too. Kaedues leans forward and outstretches his arms.*

*Unfortunately, his lack of rest comes along with no changes to his mood since before he slept. Kaedues runs his hands through his hair.*
-# **"The... When I.."** *He mutters to himself, thinking out loud.* **"Thinking.. top-down.."**
-# **"....First, find... the highest like-- probable details from a short-- an abridged list of events that occurred..."** *He tells himself,* **"Those police interrogated me. Occam's razor.. they were following a hunch."**

*Slowly, Kaedues' position shifts back into a hunch forward, elbows resting on his knees, fingers laced. As he adjusts to piecing together the story, he forgets he is whispering it to himself.*
-# **"I saw a silhouette of something that looked like an Ion Enforcer last night... I didn't get a good enough look to verify whether or not it really was one,"** *He pauses for a moment..*
-# **"To resolve this.. I have to first work off the assumption that there is a piece of supporting evidence that will prove they are following me.."**

*Kaedues' eyes pinch tighter shut. Looking at the memory is like pulling at a thread from a wound spool. The most recent events he sees first, and then the beginning.*


[3/17/2025 12:50 AM] Kaedues Staub
-# **"The alibi was well-put. Sophie had used the word 'family' in her first encounter, which implies more than one guardian. The dialogue I added did not explicitly confirm my relationship to her. That could be why I was approached in the first place."**
*Subtly, the pattern in which Kaedues breathes changes. He takes in air, holds his breath, releases, and then pauses with empty lungs before repeating it all.*
-# **"I answered all of the questions they asked, and all of the questions they didn't."** *His eyes open.* **"That could be it. I complied too much. I thought that the way I fronted my body language clearly implied I wanted no part in the questioning.. did he interpret it as something else?"**
*His eyes begin to burn holes in the space in front of him. The image of his home prints itself onto his retinas.*

**"He.. smiled at me."**


[3/17/2025 1:02 AM] Kaedues Staub
-# **"..No.. No. Choosing this as evidence is circumstantial at best. I would be cherry picking something convenient."** *His eyes trace cracks in the floor now.*
-# **"..But it wasn't just the smile. His partner gave me a look, too. Like if I was fucking with them, it wouldn't matter in the end. They didn't search--"**

*Kaedues stands up now and slowly walks toward the other end of the room.*
-# **"--Whatever they communicated to me, it wasn't on purpose. Don't think like that."** *Kaedues begins to rub his index finger and thumb together habitually..*
-# **"The glance they shared.. did they mutually agree I was full of shit?"**

*Kaedues pivots on his heel and looks through his doorway.*


[3/20/2025 9:59 AM] Sophie Donovan
It was yet another restless night for the teen. Her eyes were heavy and her movement was lathargic at best. Most of Kaedues' mumbling went with absent acknowledgement. However, when it went on without end in sight, Sophie began paying more attention to him. 

Her eyes slowly followed the red-haired man pace about his home. This wasn't her first time watching someone pace around a room and talk to themselves. Sophie sighed, her head drooping down as she did so.

**”Do you always pace around your house when you’re stressed out?”** The question was genuine, but she could have done better with its delivery. Not that Kaedues cares for it at this point, right?


[3/20/2025 10:05 AM] Kaedues Staub
**"I wouldn't know. I have never felt this way in my entire life,"** *he says. There's a 'normal' pause of consideration from Kaedues before he says that; Not his normal instant punctual response or the rarer formulated answer.*

*Kaedues starts moving toward the doorway, and toward his van.*


[3/20/2025 7:12 PM] Sophie Donovan
Sophie's eyes followed Kaedues until he vanished beyond the doorway's frame. She blinked once, then twice before leaning gently against the wall, closing her eyes, hoping that maybe she could will herself back to sleep.


[3/20/2025 7:14 PM] Narration
Kaedues exited the house to a dreary morning sky. A light drizzle of rain dotting his clothing. It was warm to the touch, indicating that this time around the rain was acidic. But, it was not enough to cause discomfort. His utility van sat in the small driveway, draped with a fresh coat of dew and rain.

A car drove past, driving over a puddle and sending a two foot wave over the gravel sidewalk as it pulled away.


[3/20/2025 8:41 PM] Kaedues Staub
*Kaedues rubs the back of his neck and pins his thought into the back of his head.* **"Ugh.."** *He'll avoid that for a few minutes, at least.*
*With a backwards step into his home, he turns to look at Sophie.*
*(Oh. She's going back to sleep.)*

*In the sake of staying.. active, in the literal sense, Kaedues walks back outside toward his van. He takes a good look at the hood.. and after that, the headlights, the doors, the bumpers, all from his standing position. He walks around the car where necessary of course!*


[3/20/2025 9:39 PM] Narration
When Kaedues walked around the rear of the vehicle. He would notice his muffler. Though, there was a thin black line protruding next to the cuff of the exhuast... An antenna?


[3/20/2025 9:42 PM] Kaedues Staub
*He crouches down now to get a better look..*

Sticking on the side of his muffler was a black device with a single led light pulsing every other second. It had a label engraved into the metal casing "BEC-TRACK-511". It was just about the size of  Kaedues's palm. A good pull could break it free from its adhesive...


[3/20/2025 10:07 PM] Kaedues Staub
**"Yes.."** *Kaedues brings his hand to his chin. He doesn't notice the smile creeping across his face until it's already there. This is a beautiful punctuation to his earlier swirling pool of thoughts.*

*(It feels like winning...)*


[3/20/2025 10:20 PM] Kaedues Staub
*It's clear enough to be a tracker. This means it is plausible that the car earlier was an Ion Enforcer, that they were followed, and that they will continue to be followed.*

*(So, how to play it off? In order to sate those officers, I'll need to give them something that aligns with what they think about me.)*
*From this mental foothold, Kaedues considers a few more realistic situations.* *(Someone that is 'too clean' like me has to be hiding something. Unfortunately, I am, and that means that if I were to commit a crime to steer them off course it would likely result in Sophie being caught.)*

*The warmth of the acid rain is felt on Kaedues' shoulders first.*
*(So I'll need to do something legal and morally questionable.. but not the kind of thing that would give them cause to suspect I am necessarily..)*
*He pauses in his head.*


[3/20/2025 10:26 PM] Kaedues Staub
*..His lips smush together for a moment.* *(I need to mull this over.)*
*Of course, giving himself time to process the situation should involve something menial. Kaedues unlocks the loading bay of the delivery van and climbs inside. After navigating behind the passenger seat, he opens up the box on the floor and takes a look at the disassembled rifle inside.*

*His eyes watch it as if it might move or jump. His hands hesitate to move, his fingers stray from grasping the cool metal surface of the gun. He does, however, pick it up and takes a close look at it.*


[3/20/2025 10:33 PM] Kaedues Staub
*The lock out on the gun prevents him from using it. This didn't, and still doesn't, bother Kaedues. If possible, he gets a __stong inclination__ not to use it.*
*Luckily though, the gun isn't locked with her biometrics. It uses a four-digit passcode..*

*(...Only four?)*
*He shakes his head, dismissing the budding thought before it bore fruit.*

*A silence washes over Kaedues now. He swallows thoughtfully and takes a deep breath in and out.* *(Doing this now may save time, if what Doug has to say holds up somehow. It would also be a good idea to check that salesman's kiosk..)*
*Regardless, he begins an audio call with Grace, or tries to anyway. Last he heard and saw, she was out.*
*(I'll just leave a message. I... would like to know how she is doing, anyway.)*

Kaedues' deck routed to Grace's UID and it began to ringing—that's a good sign. Meant that her neural deck wasn't deactived and certainly not dead. Though, the ringing continued for what felt like eternity and nearing the threshold in which it would automatically stop ringing. 

-# But then...


[3/20/2025 10:40 PM] Grace Dawson
It was Grace, she picked up. Clearly apprehensive considering the number was foreign to her. When the line activated, she took her time greeting her unknown caller.  `"....Hello?"`


[3/20/2025 10:43 PM] Kaedues Staub
*Kaedues looks up slightly, at nothing in particular. His eyes unfocus, widen. He does not immediately respond, in fact it takes maybe three or so seconds before any audio is even picked up. He breathes in.*
**"You're awake. That's good."**


[3/20/2025 10:47 PM] Grace Dawson
The silence stretched on for an equal amount of time.  `"...Uh—yeah... I guess being awake is a good thing..."` Her voice laced with apprehension.


[3/20/2025 10:50 PM] Kaedues Staub
*Kaedues considers what it could mean, but nothing comes to him. A soft breath out can be picked up over the call.*
**"...Sorry. This is Kaedues, from the weapon development shop. Danny forwarded me your contact info a while ago,"** *He explains. There's a lot to be said, but maybe one step at a time. It's difficult to find the words anyway, so this makes the conversation manageable to the redhead.*


[3/20/2025 10:52 PM] Grace Dawson
`"Kaedues?!"` She gasped. `"I'm sorry I didn't recongize your voice."` 

`"Are you, alright?"` The question came after *yet* another break in the conversation.

[3/20/2025 11:00 PM] Kaedues Staub
*A soft smile tugs at the corners of his lips.*
**"Compared to you, I was practically unharmed. All I lost was a hand."** *He answers honestly, and directly like he always did.*
*There's a pause...* **"It shouldn't have happened at all. I don't know why the drive played out like that."**

**"You sound like yourself, at least. How have you recovered?"**


[3/20/2025 11:09 PM] Grace Dawson
`"I was discharged from the hospital not too long ago... I was told it was a car accident, but I don't remember any of it. I don't even remember getting into a vehicle."` 

The next part of her explaination wasn't easy for her to disclose to him... `"I um—um... Can't walk without assistance, but I am OK. My dad said I had a few surgeries here and there. But, I was not awake for any of them and I haven't seen the discharge papers..."`


[3/20/2025 11:15 PM] Kaedues Staub
*Now, he sighs. The natural next thing to do would be to disclose what happened.. but when he looks through his head, Kaedues gets that feeling. An itching, or some kind of dull pain in the back of his head.*
-# *It is all falling apart.*

*He rubs his index finger and thumb together habitually..* **"You don't remember.. Neither did I."** *He says softly with an unspoken blueness in his tone.*
**"For a while, at least."** *He pushes down on his index finger with his thumb, enough to feel the pinch. The strange feeling in the back of his head softens a little.*


[3/20/2025 11:19 PM] Kaedues Staub
**"..I.."**
*He begins to speak it, to say the story out loud, but it somehow acts as a trigger for that sensation. It swells from the base of his skull to his forehead, feeling like needles, like fire. He pinches down harder with his fingers. Its impact on the feeling feels much smaller now..*

**"I was there,"** *He says. His voice sounds--and is-- straining. His knuckle is white from the pressure, his fingertip a blaring red for the same reason.* **"We had.. agreed to go somewhere. There is a building I wanted you to see."**


[3/20/2025 11:21 PM] Grace Dawson
`"I....I see."` Is all she managed.


[3/20/2025 11:25 PM] Kaedues Staub
**"You had.. asked me a question. I paused to think about it, and when I came up with an answer.. we were.. heading for oncoming traffic at somewhere around 80 miles per hour."** *He continues with the story now. His voice sounds less strained, but still the admission is difficult to tell anyone.*

**"..If.. this sounds like an excuse, I'm sorry. It's not meant to be."**


[3/20/2025 11:35 PM] Grace Dawson
The fragments of his story struck her deeply, filling gaps she didn't even realize existed. Her mind raced to find memories, but there was nothing, only an emptiness that gre heavier with each passing moment.

`"No-no... I—I believe you, Keadues. I just—"` She paused, taking a breath as a subtle hint of anxiety started to claw at the edges of her mind. `"It's strange, hearing about myself like this, like it happened to someone else."`

A tense silence followed her admission, `"I'm sorry, I wish—I wish I remembered... I wish I could, but I can't... I guess, whatever I said upset you."` That is where her headspace was leading her. She caused the accident. Did she anger him? Pissed him off to no end that he just blanked out? Sure, he stated he was thinking about a question. But...


[3/20/2025 11:44 PM] Kaedues Staub
*Kaedues finds himself jumping to answer now, rushing to. Something provoked instead of thought of..*
**"--No, you didn't upset me!"**

*...*
*He clears his throat.* **"..If you really believe what I said.. I.."** *He pauses. Putting this into words is difficult..* **"I want to talk to you about something. I can only hope you will understand."**

**"I'm not really in any position to be making requests of you,"** *Kaedues comments. This could be directed toward Grace, or himself.*


[3/20/2025 11:44 PM] Grace Dawson
`"..."` Silence is what he was presented with...


[3/20/2025 11:48 PM] Kaedues Staub
*He carries the silence a little further..*
**"Alright, I understand."** *Kaedues says, his tone a little softer than it has been.*


[3/20/2025 11:51 PM] Narration
Nothing was said on Grace's end.


[3/20/2025 11:55 PM] Kaedues Staub
**"..well, anyway. I went ahead and picked up what you left at the workshop. The data pads, notes. The gun."** *He pauses for a beat,* **"And the video drive. If you want them, I can figure something out."** *He says.*


[3/21/2025 12:02 AM] Grace Dawson
`"You have my video drive?! Oh no!!"` She was panicked and frantic.  `"Y-you didn't look at the files, did you?!"`


[3/21/2025 12:06 AM] Kaedues Staub
**"I did."** *He says very simply.*


[3/21/2025 12:10 AM] Grace Dawson
`"Oh my GAWD! WHY WOULD YOU DO THAT?! NO ONE WAS SUPPOSE TO LOOK AT IT!!"`  The intonation in her voice was different. One that Kaedues certainly has never heard before; She was extremely embarrassed.


[3/21/2025 12:17 AM] Kaedues Staub
*Kaedues pauses for a moment.*
**"To.. put it simply.. I __realized what you were talking about__. I wanted to know why you were curious."** *Kaedues breathes out.* **"And.. at the time, I believed your father would transport you somewhere else."**


[3/21/2025 12:20 AM] Grace Dawson
`"...."` Her immediate embarrassment subsided with the mentioning of her father. The video drive could wait, for now. `"Transport me..? I am not understanding."`


[3/21/2025 12:21 AM] Kaedues Staub
**"He.. didn't tell you?"**


[3/21/2025 12:24 AM] Grace Dawson
`"You're confusing me."` She admitted. `"I do not know what you're referring to."`


[3/21/2025 12:36 AM] Kaedues Staub
**"Your father is extremely protective of you. First impressions were very strong, and.."** *His eyes harden at nothing in particular as he recalls the scene where he met Fred.* **"clear."**

**"I met him during a visit to your hospital room. Really, Danny just dragged me there because of something circumstantial."**


[3/21/2025 12:41 AM] Kaedues Staub
**"Your father became wrapped up in something. Whether you want it to or not, it involves you."** *He carefully chooses his words. After a brief pauses, he continues,* **"There's a lot I can say and not a lot I should. Not right now. I want you to know that.."** *He sighs in a way that might imply defeat.* **"I want to make sure you are safe."**


[3/21/2025 12:44 AM] Grace Dawson
`'Oh... That is what you meant."` She remarked to herself outloud. A slow exhale escaped her lips and were picked up in the call. `"I've known and the way things have been playing out... There is no avoiding it."`

`"But, it makes me wonder.. How do you know?"`


[3/21/2025 12:46 AM] Kaedues Staub
**"..That makes things easier."** *Considering one of the videos on that chip drive, it's not unreasonable at all to believe what she's saying.*
**"I was there when he was told to take her out."**


[3/21/2025 12:50 AM] Grace Dawson
`"Things have taken an interesting turn."` She admits.


[3/21/2025 12:50 AM] Grace Dawson឵
`"I don't know how much I should be telling you... But, I feel compelled to tell you, a bit at least... We are currently with them. Paige and Mathias... Safe, of course. There does seem to be some unspoken tension between my father and them. But, as my father puts it. They are the lesser of two evils."`


[3/21/2025 12:57 AM] Kaedues Staub
**"...There are a few things I could say to prove I'm not lying, or anything like that."** *Kaedues looks toward his house through the windshield.*
**"As long as you are safe, I am satisfied on that front. If you want me to drop off any of your things, I can do that."**


[3/21/2025 12:58 AM] Kaedues Staub
**"Someone told me I should arm myself. I get the impression you meant something else when you said you had 'known for a while'."** *Kaedues looks up at the ceiling of the van now.* **"Do you know anything about why?"**


[3/21/2025 1:05 AM] Grace Dawson
`"I'm afraid there won't be a way to return my things as things stand now... It hasn't been that long. It started with calls and quickly strangers began showing up at our home."` Pause...

`"I don't want to alarm you, but you deserve to be warned."`

Grace paused for about 15 seconds...

`"District 9 is going to be besieged by some army of sorts. From what my dad tells me, the whole place will be a warzone in the next few months. He's working on securing some kind of passage out, but there are complications..."`


[3/21/2025 1:13 AM] Kaedues Staub
*Kaedues doesn't speak initially. He looks down. He looks down at the gun in the box, and listens to Grace speak. Once she finishes her statement, it would still take Kaedues a few moments to speak up.*

**"Fine,"** *He says. Now, Kaedues gets up and moves out of the loading bay. He locks it up when he leaves, and heads toward his home.*


[3/21/2025 1:18 AM] Grace Dawson
`"I'm sorry... I... will talk to my dad, maybe he could help you? Or maybe Danny?"`


[3/21/2025 1:19 AM] Sophie Donovan
Sophie was still awake, but her eyes were closed with sleep eluding her once again. The handle to the door clicked, prompting the teen to roll her head against the wall to face Kaedues. Once more, she remains quiet, studying him.


[3/21/2025 1:22 AM] Kaedues Staub
**"I would not bother,"** *He replies. His eyes briefly flick down to Sophie, acknowledging her before he continues. However, he does move toward another room in the house, the bathroom.* **"Your father's first impressions of me are poor, and will decline when you tell him about what happened.  Don't worry about me."**


[3/21/2025 1:22 AM] Kaedues Staub
**"On the same note.. do you mind if I borrow your rifle?"**


[3/21/2025 9:17 PM] Grace Dawson
It was evident even through their call that Grace was feeling a myraid of emotions. But despite this profound assumption, Grace did not push the subject any further than it needed to. `"8872... That is the lockout combination for the lower receiver."`


[3/21/2025 10:20 PM] Kaedues Staub
*Kaedues lets out an amused huff that picks up over their call..*
**"It's fine if you doubt me. My favorite part about working with new clients is proving my skills."** *He looks into the mirror at himself.* **"8872.... right, it __did__ only have four numbers. What about the other sequence? What's that for?"** *He follows up.*


[3/21/2025 11:04 PM] Grace Dawson
`"Other sequence?"`


[3/21/2025 11:06 PM] Kaedues Staub
**"581677."** *He says out loud.* **"What's it for?"**


[3/21/2025 11:07 PM] Grace Dawson
`"I don't know what you're talking about."` She claimed.


[3/21/2025 11:12 PM] Kaedues Staub
**"You __don't__?"** *He asks sincerely. There is an uncertainty to his tone, maybe even a nervousness.*


[3/21/2025 11:12 PM] Grace Dawson
`"No, I don't. You're not making any sense to me."`


[3/21/2025 11:12 PM] Grace Dawson
`"I only know of the one."`


[3/21/2025 11:23 PM] Kaedues Staub
*When Kaedues pauses, he feels a dull and uncomfortable feeling rising in his stomach.*
-# **"It feels like everything was riding on that."** *Kaedues speaks softly to himself.*

**"Alright.. well, that's cleared up then."** *Kaedues looks up at the ceiling, now.* **"If you need something from me, send a call. I'll do what I can."**


[3/21/2025 11:24 PM] Grace Dawson
`"...Bye."` Is all she ended with.


[3/21/2025 11:26 PM] Kaedues Staub
*He hangs up. The social void that fills his headspace after the call ends only draws attention to that pressing thought.*
*(She didn't know..)*

*He steps forward, taking another look toward Sophie to see if she had gone back to sleep.*


[3/21/2025 11:38 PM] Sophie Donovan
Sophie left her sleeping bag, now sitting on the top it with her legs crossed. She looked tired, but awake for the time being. She lost interest in Kaedues for the time begin, resorting the binder of shards.


[3/21/2025 11:42 PM] Kaedues Staub
*Kaedues approaches her, then. He doesn't enter the space she's using to sort the shards.*

*He crouches down in front of her.*
**"When I was giving them my story, they placed a tracker on the van."** *He says plainly.*


[3/21/2025 11:44 PM] Sophie Donovan
Kaedues's voice pulled her from sorting. Sophie glanced back towards him before pushing a shard onto one of the sleeve postings. **"Don't they have anything better to do?"** She asked rhetorically. Setting the binder off to her left, she placed her hands in the space in her lap. **"What does that mean for us?"**


[3/21/2025 11:48 PM] Kaedues Staub
*Kaedues waits to hear the full extent of her response before replying. He doesn't react much to Sophie's first question, but to her second..*

*He folds his arms over his knees. A smile inches up Kaedues' face, and not the subtle kind. No, this is the kind of smile that occurs to you--something involuntary, a giddy and tingling response to some internal thought.*

**"It means we get to have a lot of fun this week."**


[3/21/2025 11:59 PM] Sophie Donovan
Sophie tilted her head slightly to the side at his statement. **"Like...?"**


[3/22/2025 12:01 AM] Kaedues Staub
**"Well, the tracker is more or less an admission that they're following us."** *He explains, but it's more of an opening to the next thing.* **"They wouldn't need to do that if they had anything concrete."**


[3/22/2025 12:05 AM] Kaedues Staub
*His eyes close, but his smile sticks around..*
**"All we have to do is waste their time, I am fairly sure. If that falls through, I have a backup plan anyway."**


[3/22/2025 12:14 AM] Sophie Donovan
Sophie glances off to the side. Harassing the harassers? This could end badly in so many ways, but... She chuckled once, there is a slight curl at the edge of her lips. Though, the smile was short lived as a yawn took over. Once, that was over, Sophie, returned her gaze towards Kaedues while rubbing her eye. **"Where do we start?"**

[3/22/2025 12:19 AM] Kaedues Staub
**"Let's drive somewhere and create a situation that would incriminate them, first. Catch them looking when they really shouldn't."**

*He looks up, and rubs his chin with the broad side of his index finger.*


[3/22/2025 8:43 PM] Sophie Donovan
**"And how do we do that without them deciding its more worth arresting you on the spot?"** Sophie unfolded her legs and pushed herself up onto her feet and grabbing her jacket with one hand, using her other hand to pulll down the length of her face.


[3/22/2025 9:31 PM] Kaedues Staub
*Kaedues closes his eyes and furrows his eyebrows for a minute.* **"That's..."**
*He shakes his head.* **"They won't do that. Doesn't fit the narrative."** *He comments.* **"If they were going to act like you are imagining them, the opportunity already presented itself. A better opportunity than now, for sure."**


[3/22/2025 9:33 PM] Kaedues Staub
**"I know my story perfectly lines up, and I think that is why they are suspicious. They took action, actually..."** *His smile grows a tad larger now.* **"Yeah.. They're playing it by the book. Maybe they think a promotion could come their way."**


[3/22/2025 9:35 PM] Sophie Donovan
**"Anything right now beats trying to go back to sleep."** Sophie begin to slip her jacket onto her body.


[3/22/2025 9:37 PM] Kaedues Staub
**"There's one more thing, though."** *Kaedues' eyes open. For a second, he is confused because he only sees her legs. His eyes quickly correct themselves and hone in on her face.*
**"I need to show you something before we head out."**


[3/22/2025 9:39 PM] Sophie Donovan
**"...Show me what?"** Sophie rolled her shoulders, allowing the seams of the jacket to settle where they ought.


[3/22/2025 9:41 PM] Kaedues Staub
**"If I tell you, you'll get cold feet. It's in the van, and it'll only take a few minutes at most."**
*Now, Kaedues rises to his feet and starts walking toward his vehicle. He unlocks the loading bay and waits for Sophie to tail behind-- if she does.*


[3/22/2025 9:42 PM] Sophie Donovan
With not much else going for her. She bent over and picked her binder up before following Kaedues out the door. It would be a lie to say that she was a bit curious as to what he wanted to show.


[3/22/2025 9:43 PM] Kaedues Staub
*Seeing Sophie follow along, he climbs into the loading bay. He rests in a crouching position next to the box behind the passenger seat..*
**"Close the doors behind you."**


[3/22/2025 9:44 PM] Sophie Donovan
**"...Alright."** Sophie climbed in and eased herself down onto her knees before reaching back and closing the doors. Once they were closed, she turned her head towards Kaedues and ultimately the box that was nestled in front of him.


[3/22/2025 9:49 PM] Kaedues Staub
*He pulls the flaps of the cardboard out, and promptly fishes out the lower mechanism of Grace's rifle..*
**"I don't assume you've held a gun before."** *His eyes thoroughly analyze Sophie's reaction to the situation as he continues with his statement.*


[3/22/2025 9:52 PM] Sophie Donovan
The moment she made out the shape of the lower receiver, Sophie's eyes widened briefly in familiarity before settling as her curious eyes once were. She remained at the back doors, silently she thought about the potential implications that could come from this wordless revelation.

Despite recongizing what it was, Sophie did little in the form of movement.


[3/22/2025 9:57 PM] Kaedues Staub
**"I want to make it clear that I don't expect you to use a gun,"** *He practicalle declares to Sophie.* **"but with what Doug and Grace mentioned, things are going to get dangerous near the tail end of our arrangement."**

*Kaedues extends the lower mechanism of the gun toward Sophie, with the handle facing her.* **"If you understand why I contacted that woman in Littleton, then it's simple. This is sort of the same thing."**


[3/22/2025 10:07 PM] Sophie Donovan
Sophie looked at the lower before slowly wrapping her hand around the handle. She was careful, extremely careful. She never handled one before, and it was evident in her mindeful tilting and carrying of the section. 

**"I would assumed you would expect anything and everything."** Sophie said mindlessly as she examined the lockout tag with the combination 0000 set. She closed her eyes, muttering something under her breath before opening once more.

Satisfied with this surprise, Sophie held it out to him for Kaedues to relinquish her possession of it.


[3/22/2025 10:19 PM] Kaedues Staub
*When prompted to grab the lower mechanism, Kaedues finds himself looking absently at the floor of the van. Her automated comment asks for some thought from the redhead.*
*His eyes move and glue to the gun. He blinks slowly, and then reaches out to grab it.* **"You were right."***

*The gun pulls from Sophie's grasp. He tosses the gun gently upwards, and grabs it as it falls properly. His fingers naturally adjust around the handle, finding a comfortable spot. He keeps the chamber pointed down.*
**"--about being on autopilot. Driving. Yesterday."**


[3/22/2025 10:27 PM] Sophie Donovan
Sophie's eyes also lowered in response to Kaedues' admission. Really, she was just calling it how she saw it. It was somehow soothing to know that her hunch was correct. Then, they returned to the thoughtful Kaedues' hands. The way he manipulated weapons... When he was in a showdown with Doug and even now, he handled it in a way that seemed __responsible__. 

**"I was not looking to be correct. It was just how I could interpret it."** She then averted her gaze from the weapon towards the side of the van. **"Sometimes, you just need someone else other than yourself to call things out."** She shifted from her knees to her rear, getting as comfortable as one could get in the back of a van.

**"I didn't think you were. I don't think you understand, though. To use that word felt.. accurate. That is sticking with me."**
*Kaedues accesses the lockout tag. He punches in the numbers while considering how to phrase this next..*
`8 7 8 2`

**"...I never dreamed, before. Before a few weeks ago."**

The lockout did not disengage. Was the combination wrong?


[3/22/2025 10:45 PM] Sophie Donovan
**"Hmm.."** Sophie thought for a moment, her hair was still down from the night before. Without much of a thought, she began to pull it up into a ponytail once more. **"I never heard of someone never dreaming."** She remarks.


[3/22/2025 10:47 PM] Kaedues Staub
**"Everything else __like that__ started happening at around the.."** *He squints at the lockout curiously.* **"..same time.."** *He'd go to input the code again, just to make sure he isn't seeing things..*
`8 8 7 2`


[3/22/2025 10:54 PM] Narration
Immediate disenaged occured from the lock, allowing the trigger to lock into position. The firing pin was now enaged. All there was left to do was connection the upper and lower together and he'd have a functioning rifle.


[3/22/2025 10:54 PM] Sophie Donovan
**"You ever thought about seeing someone who could help you make sense of all of that?"** She asked, leaning back into her arms that were propped behind her as Sophie glanced over in his direction.


[3/22/2025 11:21 PM] Kaedues Staub
**"I had thought about it. It crossed my mind to ask Danny, because I think he has an idea of what.. it is."**
*For a few moments, Kaedues inspects the weapon. He assumes it is loaded, so he retrieves the upper section of the gun and latches it into place before manually clearing the chamber and releasing the magazine in one completely fluid motion.*


[3/22/2025 11:26 PM] Narration
A singular bullet ejected from the chamber. It dinked against the metal surface that made up the bed of the van and rolled in the groves of the frame before settling.


[3/22/2025 11:28 PM] Sophie Donovan
**"...All the more reason for us to get through this."**

Sophie watched the bullet jump into the air before hitting the van's surface with virtually no rebound. **"I hope we don't have to use it."**


[3/22/2025 11:38 PM] Kaedues Staub
*The bullet finds itself between Kaedues' fingers before very long. He takes a look into the magazine, and takes a slow breath in and out.*
*(Just get her home.) He thinks to himself; Prompts himself. The usual response doesn't come. That cold feeling and the simple, direct way to pull himself out of situations like this doesn't come.* **"It's too big for you, anyway. You should still learn, but I'll be using it if we have to."**


[3/22/2025 11:38 PM] Kaedues Staub
**"Are you hungry?"** *He asks.*


[3/22/2025 11:41 PM] Sophie Donovan
**"A little."** She admits.


[3/22/2025 11:44 PM] Kaedues Staub
**"A little.."** *He mirrors Sophie.* **"Do you lose your appetite in the mornings?"**


[3/22/2025 11:49 PM] Sophie Donovan
She shrugged subtly. **"I can't eat when I first wake up.. But I been awake for a few hours now."**


[3/22/2025 11:52 PM] Kaedues Staub
**"Right.. Do you get to decide what you eat for breakfast?"** *Looking into the mag, it's clear that it has been topped off.*
*(Give or take.. probably holds around 25 bullets. However many, plus the one that was in the chamber.)*

*With that, Kaedues allows the gun to rest in his hands. For now.*


[3/22/2025 11:57 PM] Sophie Donovan
Sophie shook her head. **"My meals are usually handpicked that have high concentrates of vitamins and magnesium."**


[3/23/2025 12:01 AM] Kaedues Staub
**"We have a few places you can eat at without worrying about food poisoning."** *He punctuates his statement by tilting his head left and then right, a sign of correcting oneself.* **"Well, there's always the 'one in fifteen' rule.. but outliers exist only to drag the average."**


[3/23/2025 12:01 AM] Kaedues Staub
**"Do you have anything in mind?"**


[3/23/2025 12:06 AM] Sophie Donovan
**"As long it isn't gruel. You know more about the foods here than I do."**


[3/23/2025 12:07 AM] Kaedues Staub
**"..You ever had a gyro?"**


[3/23/2025 12:07 AM] Sophie Donovan
**"...no?"**


[3/23/2025 12:11 AM] Kaedues Staub
**"I went to a spot recently. It's better than a lot of the food here. There's meat and bread, and some kind of sauce. A good source of protein and carbohydrates."**
*He slides the magazine back into place..*


[3/23/2025 12:16 AM] Sophie Donovan
**"That is fine with me.."** Sophie sits up


[3/23/2025 12:23 AM] Kaedues Staub
*Kaedues quickly disassembles the rifle into its larger components like it was before. He loads the loose bullet into the separated chamber again, stores the gun in the box, and...*
*He picks up the lockout tag off the floor of the van. (I probably shouldn't lock it out if I expect to use it..) Considering the application of a lockout tag, Kaedues looks into the box and verifies that the safety of the rifle is on.*
-# **"Good. Don't want that coming back to bite me."**

*With a slow breath in, Kaedues nods toward the front of the van.* **"Let's get something, then."**
*He climbs over the armrest to settle himself into the driver's seat.*


[3/23/2025 12:25 AM] Sophie Donovan
Sophie does the same, settling in the passenger seat. **"How far is this place anyways?"**


[3/23/2025 12:28 AM] Kaedues Staub
**"Safe to say half an hour away. A little less to be accurate, and a little more with bad traffic."**
*He starts the van and pulls out of his driveway.* **"A gyro is like a sandwich, but the bread is flat and rolled up. Like a sleeve."**


[3/23/2025 12:34 AM] Sophie Donovan
**"Sounds cheap."** Resting her head against her hand along the door.


[3/23/2025 12:38 AM] Kaedues Staub
*Her comment now provokes a sharp inhale from Kaedues. Despite the action, he doesn't comment.*
**"Speaking of guns earlier, there's another thing you might want to think about. Actually, this goes for any weapon."**

**"Deploying. Taking it out. If I have that rifle strapped to my back, your knife is faster."**


[3/23/2025 12:43 AM] Sophie Donovan
**"I've seen action movies... There are things scarier than a gun and I have seen a few scenes where the jumpjunkie with a knife outpaces a gun. Like netrunners, frying your circuits by simply blinking."** She glanced over towards him.


[3/23/2025 12:47 AM] Kaedues Staub
**"....That kind of thing won't work in real life. I don't have experience with netrunners, but outpacing a gun isn't something you'll see anyone do. If you get close enough though, you can work with their blind spot."**


[3/23/2025 12:53 AM] Sophie Donovan
**"Mmn,"** She didn't seem all too convienced with what Kaedues was saying. Afterall, out of the two of them. She was sure she has seen what netrunners could do in the movies. Even her father reinforced this notion in the past before during a conversation.


[3/23/2025 12:59 AM] Kaedues Staub
*Kaedues lets out a defeated sigh, as if all of the remaining motivation he had to continue this particular path in the conversation had completely vanished.*
-# **"It's been.. a day or two..?"** *Kaedues asks himself out loud.*


[3/23/2025 1:12 AM] Sophie Donovan
**"..?"** Did he say something?


[3/23/2025 1:17 AM] Kaedues Staub
*He glances shortly at Sophie.* **"Oh, nothing. Just asking myself a question."**
*Today, the drive is quiet. As quiet as a drive out of the Stacks can really be, at least. Maybe it's the early morning atmosphere...*
*Kaedues finds himself fixating on driving more. How much pressure to put on the accelerator, where his hands are on the wheel, and exactly how fast he is going...*

[3/24/2025 11:58 PM] Kaedues Staub
*The van slowly pulls into Kaedues' driveway. Once the van stops, Kaedues unbuckles and begins to exit like clockwork.* **"Alright.."** *He muses. He hadn't prepared anything yet. In retrospect, that quiet time in the van could have been used for such a thing.*


[3/25/2025 12:06 AM] Sophie Donovan
Unbuckling her seatbelt, Sophie grabbed the bag of food and exited the vehicle herself. **"What about the tracker? Do we keep it on the van until we figure out what to do with it?"** She questioned, catching up to him.


[3/25/2025 12:07 AM] Kaedues Staub
**"More or less. Toss me a gyro?"** *He locks the van and closes the driver-side door, holding a hand toward Sophie as he walks past the hood.*


[3/25/2025 12:15 AM] Sophie Donovan
She reached into the bag and retreived a gyro before handing it to him. **"Haven't seen any lawmen vehicles and come to think of it. I haven't seen any lawmen in a while. Weren't they swarming the place a bit ago?"**


[3/25/2025 12:24 AM] Kaedues Staub
**"Talked to a guy in the Metro who mentioned something about it. He said that some Vesperian Legionnaires are taking over the CCR's security. Pretty sure those guys are the borged-out ones. I saw a tank roll down toward the workshop I worked at."**

*He quickly unwraps it. Kaedues doesn't bite into it, not yet.*
**"I don't.. like them. They give me this weird sense of deja vu."** *He looks down at the gyro in his hands for a moment before biting into the flesh of the bread and meat.*
*With a bite in his mouth, he chews once and then pauses thoughtfully. His eyebrows lower and then he continues to chew..*


[3/25/2025 12:28 AM] Sophie Donovan
**"...?"** Sophie was curious as to why he felt this way. **"Then, I assume its best we avoid them. Moreso than those deadbeat lawmen."** She glanced over her shoulder, looking down the road. One could never be too cautious.


[3/25/2025 12:32 AM] Kaedues Staub
**"This is better than the last one I had."** *Kaedues comments out loud. He keeps eating the wrap, slower than he normally might.*

**"Anyway, about the tracker. In this situation, you hafta think about what happens after you fuck with it,"** *He comments with a mouthful. He swallows before continuing.* **"Putting it on someone else's car will work wonders until they find out they're following the wrong guy. Once they find out, they'll have a good enough excuse to come find us."**


[3/25/2025 12:34 AM] Kaedues Staub
*Another bite finishes the light meal for Kaedues. He tilts his head back and forth and crumples up the paper that the gyro came in..*
**"Well, unless the car's going somewhere really far away. That could work, unless it happens to pass them on the way."**


[3/25/2025 12:45 AM] Sophie Donovan
**"It isn't like we could leave Haven Heights even if we wanted too."** She surmised, reaching into the bag and retrieving her own. She was a bit hesistant on trying it, but she was starving.


[3/25/2025 12:47 AM] Sophie Donovan
**"Knowing that we are stuck here really illustrates how hopeless people must feel living down here."** She would take a bite and chewed thoughtfully. **"Hmph...?"**


[3/25/2025 12:48 AM] Kaedues Staub
**"No, we could. I found a way before we went to see Doug. It would be a bad idea, though. I mentioned earlier that I took a job in Fairview. Something that Aurora woman said.. gave me a bad feeling about how closely your lawmen are listening."**


[3/25/2025 12:51 AM] Sophie Donovan
**"I don't know who Aurora is... But, lawmen were everywhere in Fairview."** She remarked, following up on Kaedues' response. **"They are in our schools, our hospitals, our everything. I suppose there was more to lose there."**


[3/25/2025 12:56 AM] Kaedues Staub
**"Around this area, you basically don't have to worry about police. Actually, there's a couple places they should know better than to go."**

*He pushes his hands into his pockets and looks up.* **"I gave some gang members the coordinates to an abandoned building to use as a hideout. If they're using it and they remember me, I might be able to work something out there.."**
*His face tenses for a moment and he tilts his head in another direction.*
-# **"I did break his nose, though. So.. we're even? They didn't like me to begin with, so..."**


[3/25/2025 1:01 AM] Sophie Donovan
**"You sure like to aim for the nose."** She took another bite of her food. Now sitting on the two step porch he had. Having Kaedues this talkative was— It was calming.

**"And, you get around— ALOT from what I have picked up. In Fairview, we don't get that luxury. Curfews and age restrictions ar everywhere."** She then pitched her head towards the sky. For once, it was a clear morning. **"This is the most freedom I have experienced."**


[3/25/2025 1:08 AM] Kaedues Staub
**"There's almost as many nerves in your nose as there are nerves in your crotch,"** *He comments, leaning his head toward her now just enough to get her in sight line.*

**"Until now, I would work full time and part time. When I wasn't helping at the workshop, I did manual labor for anyone who asked."**
*Kaedues points with his thumb toward the van he stands next to.* **"After I crashed the last one, I borrowed this from someone.."**


[3/25/2025 1:09 AM] Kaedues Staub
*He pauses.* **"Well.. apparently, I bought it. It's also in better condition than it was when it was given to me..."** *He scratches his head a little.*


[3/25/2025 12:11 PM] Sophie Donovan
Sophie looked towards the utility van. It looked unremarkable to say the least— compared to Fairview standards. 

**"Is this one of those instances where you just don’t remember.?"**


[3/25/2025 12:19 PM] Kaedues Staub
*Kaedues gives Sophie a quizzical look that eventually points itself at nowhere in particular..*
**"No, it's not the same thing... definitely not."** *Kaedues says with a slow shake of his head.* **"After I borrowed it, I drove up to Monita with it for a gig."**

*He looks into his house from the vantage point of his car.*
**"I don't know how to describe this..."** *He runs his fingers through his hair. It isn't tangled at all, as if he had just brushed or something.* **"..Okay. Kind of like a cut in an action movie you watch. I was in my car driving one moment, and in the next I was laying down in my home."**


[3/25/2025 12:21 PM] Kaedues Staub
**"Danny had touched base with me only a very short time before I departed for Monita. When I woke up, I found out that five days passed, and the van was mine, and it was restored.."**

*Kaedues' eyes flick over to Sophie, and one corner of his lips turn upward; the side facing away from her. He grabs hold of his mechanical hand and disengages it from his wrist before tossing it her way.*
**"And somehow, I had this replacement hand."**


[3/25/2025 8:38 PM] Sophie Donovan
The sudden toss startled the girl. At first she flinched before her instincts told her to catch whatever was coming at her— Sophie's gyro fell safely into her lap. Once it was within her grasp, Sophie juggled it a few times—not trusting the grip she had on it would suffice. **"?!"** 

When her mind stopped sending her through the circus, she had the hand clutched inbetween two of her own. Her thumbs were pressed against the palm while the rest of her digits provided a solid foundation at the mechanical knuckles. 

The display left her sheepish. Fumbling like an idiot was embarrassing, so she thought. The look of self-conscious did not remain on her features for long as her attention was paid towards the intricate details. **"Does it hurt when you hit it or pinch it?"** She inquired, tilting the hand to one side. The fingers had a subtle bounce to them when she did so.


[3/25/2025 10:07 PM] Kaedues Staub
*Kaedues places his right hand in his pocket while he watches Sophie fumble with the cybernetic.*

**"Yeah-- even now. It feels just as real as my old hand, even though it doesn't look nearly the same."**

*Completely unprompted, the hand's fingers begin to wiggle and squirm as if the hand has come to life, and is trying to escape!!*


[3/26/2025 7:24 PM] Sophie Donovan
The moment she realized the fingers started to move, Sophie yelped in teenage girl surprise. Immediately, she pushed it away with both her hands and let it go. Essentially tossing it in front of herself.


[3/26/2025 10:08 PM] Kaedues Staub
*As the cybernetic hand clatters with a ringing noise only metal can produce, Kaedues steps forward and picks it up.*

**"It even moves how I want when it's detached, see?"**


[3/26/2025 11:32 PM] Sophie Donovan
**"Yeah..."** She brought her hands back to her lap so that she could take a hold of her food once more. **"Next time, warn me... I think cybernetic limbs are weird."**


[3/27/2025 12:40 AM] Kaedues Staub
*In one fluid motion, Kaedues attaches his left arm to its socket again. He crouches down in front of Sophie and looks up into the sky..*

**"We-- I got sidetracked. I believe your hunch about that clerk. I don't know if it's true or not, but I believe you when you say you aren't lying."**

*His face contorts a little as his eyes pan across the bleak and dreary greys of the sky overhead.*
**"I don't like that."**


[3/27/2025 10:37 PM] Sophie Donovan
Sophie stood up, taking another nibble out of her food. She allowed herself to chew prior to responding to Kaedues. **"As long as we stay away from that place. I am certain myself that we will be okay."**


[3/28/2025 8:42 AM] Kaedues Staub
*Maybe in response to her conclusion, Kaedues' eyes close. His eyebrows pinch together..*

**"I've never met __anyone__ who was compared to me like that. I never thought of it.. but it.. worries me?"** *He states aloud as more of a question than a statement.*


[3/30/2025 7:48 PM] Sophie Donovan
**"I think it would be difficult for me to compare anything to you. I guess we both are in agreeance on that then."** Sophie took the final bite from her food before bringing one of her legs up so she could rest her head against it's knee. The other left pressed against the ground.


[3/30/2025 7:53 PM] Kaedues Staub
*Kaedues thinks for a little longer, or rather tries to understand where this strange feeling is coming from. Stewing on it unfortunately brings him no closer to an understanding, so he shrugs it off and stands up tall.*

**"Okay... Playing along. Easy to do."** *His eyes, which had begun to only distantly look forward, hone in on Sophie as he comments..* **"How'd you learn to act?"**


[3/30/2025 9:00 PM] Sophie Donovan
Sophie gave Kaedues a quizzacial look. Her eyes squinted with her eyebrows arching inverted slightly. The question was so... odd. Who asks these kinds of questions? Those who might be like Kaedues, of course. 

She corrected her look, taking the time to actually take the question seriously. Not everyone has the most convient background.. **"That's an odd question."** Her gaze goes forward, towards the street that ran adjecent to Kaedues' house. 

**"The logical answer would be that you learn from those you're closest too. Your parents first then your peers. Which play a larger role in how you act when you're no longer a small child."**


[3/30/2025 9:07 PM] Kaedues Staub
*Kaedues crosses his arms and raises his eyebrows; a signal that realistically implies he isn't convinced.*
**"It's not an odd question considering how you have acted up until this point. When the lawmen approached you in that general store, you gave them a realistic enough answer.."** *He states. The hand overlapping his other arm sticks one finger out, describing his first point.*

**"Then, you co-signed me when we approached Noelle. Normally stories fall apart then, but you had something up your sleeve."** *A second finger pokes up, noting his second point..*

**"The most important thing, though, is that you could piece anything together at all back at Doug's place. It was impressive,"** *Kaedues clarifies to be sure,* **"and revealing."** *A third finger rises!*


[3/30/2025 9:36 PM] Sophie Donovan
Sophie huffed a breath through her nose, half-smirking at Kaedues' dramatic finger-counting. She didn't look back at him yet—just kept watching the street, eyes following the slow-moving delivery drone buzzing past.

She then released her leg from her arms, allowing it to slide down and come into contact with the concrete. 

**"You think I had some master plan?"** she asked, tone laced with a dry amusement. **"I didn't. Not really."** She finally turned her head to glance at him, expression somewhere between defiant and uncertain. **"But you're not wrong either."**

She shifted, hands in the front pocket of her jacket. Boucing her foot with the strength in her toes as her eyes went towards the pavement beneath them. **"When things get bad enough, you learn to pay attention. Who's watching. Who's lying What you __have__ to say versus what you shouldn't say. Like when you lied to those lawmen a few days back."** 

**"Just because I live in Fairview doesn't mean I am clueless to the idea of having to lie. That is what we teenagers do 90 percent of the time. We just game the system and challenge everything."**

She shifted her head again, into the direction of Kaedues. **"So yeah. I acted the way I did because I *had* to. Not because I was taught by some wise adult or because I had the perfect afterschool acting class. You learn fast when you're backed into a corner enough times. Be it turamatic or you simply need excuse so you could link up with your output."**

She paused, then shrugged like she hadn't just dropped something meaningful. **"Guess that's my answer."**


[3/30/2025 9:42 PM] Kaedues Staub
*Kaedues chuckles to himself near the end of her explanation and rubs the back of his neck. He pauses a spell and then points with his head toward the street.*

**"Come on. A walk is a good idea. We've spent the past day in and out of that van."**


[3/30/2025 9:49 PM] Sophie Donovan
**"Ugh.."** She'd protest briefly before leaning fowards to gain momemntum to stand up with minimal effort. **"You sound like my mom."**


[3/30/2025 9:52 PM] Kaedues Staub
*He looks casually over to her once more.* **"You don't like a change of pace?"**


[3/30/2025 9:59 PM] Sophie Donovan
**"I'm just not the athletic type. Chasing Mia around is exercise enough."**


[3/30/2025 10:01 PM] Kaedues Staub
*Kaedues lets out an amused puff of air from his nose.* **"Not athletic enough to walk?"**


[3/30/2025 10:11 PM] Sophie Donovan
**"Pretty much..."** Despite protesting, she seemed ready to go walking regardless.


[3/30/2025 10:15 PM] Kaedues Staub
*Kaedues thinks to himself and looks up into the air...* **"I'm gonna teach you how to do some of my jobs,"** *Kaedues announces out loud. He strides once toward his van and double-checks that it's locked before walking off past his home..*


[3/30/2025 10:24 PM] Sophie Donovan
**"One of your jobs?"** She followed aside him, keeping up with his pace. **"What does that entail?"**


[3/30/2025 10:28 PM] Kaedues Staub
**"Literally anything. I'm what is called a gofer,"** *He explains briefly--* **"so I do whatever is asked. I clean or repair pipe work, install air conditioning units, manufacture weapons, and build furniture.. and clean, too."** *He looks at Sophie for a spell before centering his gaze forward.*

**"No one-- and I mean no one-- likes doing any of these as a job. Learning to do any of them comes with learning a lot more than you might think, though."**


[3/30/2025 10:30 PM] Kaedues Staub
*He reaches into his pocket and pulls out a stick of coconut gum. He unwraps it and tosses the wrapper into the street. With another moment passed, he's already chewing. His brow furrows now, like he's pondering something.*


[3/30/2025 10:31 PM] Sophie Donovan
**"Like what?"** She wasn't convienced—not one bit.


[3/30/2025 10:35 PM] Kaedues Staub
*Kaedues thinks to himself. The purpose of that little tidbit was to sell Sophie on the idea, so it'd be good to tell her something interesting..*

**"Three legged tables and chairs don't wobble when you shake them. Did you know that?"**


[3/30/2025 10:45 PM] Sophie Donovan
**"Uh...No?"** She didn't sound disinterested, but not any more convinced either.


[3/30/2025 10:54 PM] Kaedues Staub
*Kaedues stuffs his hands into his pockets and thinks a little more.*
*(Coming up with something to say that does not directly pertain to the job is a little harder than I thought. Maybe that's because.. ah.)*

**"I know of simple toxins made from everyday cleaners and where to find them.. and where to find a lot of supply routes coming in and out of Haven Heights."**
*With a hand gesture, he elaborates;* **"The weapon shop your father worked at received shipments of sheet metal, for instance. They come routinely and on time."**


[3/30/2025 11:00 PM] Sophie Donovan
**"...Hm."** She thought about it, now that Kaedues details these things. She could see their usefulness for someone needing to think outside of the box. **"I guess that sounds interesting."**


[3/30/2025 11:01 PM] Kaedues Staub
**"..I can hear when batteries are running out of juice,"** *he adds.* **"That kind of thing."**
*He continues to walk down the road toward a shipping facility.. where there are printers and paper to be used.*


[3/30/2025 11:22 PM] Sophie Donovan
**"I suppose that could be useful if you were working with machines that took batteries..."**

**"I'll bite for now."** She'd mutter to herself more than to Kaedues. It wouldn't hurt to go for a walk... Unless they were going to get jumped.

The sharp stink of rust, oil, and something vaguely organic hit Sophie first—thick and sour like sweat that had been trapped in pipes for years. She pulled her jacket up tighter around her shoulders as she and Kaedues stepped off the crumbling curb into the shadow of the building.

The entrance was lit by flickering neon—one sign barely clinging to its mounting, scrawled with what looked like **"Ghetto Smble♥"** in uneven red paint. The other, a sickly red glow, tried to bark out some half-legible warning or name. It buzzed faintly, like it was choking on its own power.


[3/30/2025 11:33 PM] Sophie Donovan
**"Where are we?"** The place barely had a lobby... You wouldn't count that single bar stool and bar table a lobby. Thankfully for them both, no one was in the front.

[3/30/2025 11:38 PM] Kaedues Staub
**"This is a shipping joint,"** *Kaedues explains.* **"I'm not here to collect anything, though. I'm gonna print some ads and place them around this neighborhood. I need clients, after all."**


[3/30/2025 11:45 PM] Sophie Donovan
Sophie kept a careful eye on their surroundings, shoulders tense and steps measured. **"You come here often then?"**


[3/31/2025 11:42 AM] Kaedues Staub
*Kaedues notices her tension. He looks around slowly, leisurely..* **"Yeah, I do.."**

*He stops outside the door, near the table. He makes a hand gesture-- pointing his palm up at hip level to make a point of their surroundings.*
**"Everywhere looks like this. To me, to the workers and the regulars, this isn't shady."** *Now his hand slips into his pocket.* **"We should go somewhere that is worth being nervous around. That way, you will be more comfortable here in comparison."**


[3/31/2025 1:38 PM] Sophie Donovan
**"Eh—"** 

Her eyes narrowed, disgust written on her face regardin the idea. **"I appreciate the thought behind it. But __no thanks__. That sounds like a terrible idea."**


[3/31/2025 1:48 PM] Kaedues Staub
**"We'll get around to that later, then."** *Kaedues shrugs and tilts his head toward the entryway. He looks around briefly before walking straight toward a set of nearby printers..*
**"Advertising's important. Say,"** *He hesitates for a second, going so far as to stop in his tracks for a split second.* **"--Charlee, do you know what pattern people read papers in?"**


[3/31/2025 1:52 PM] Sophie Donovan
She blinked in surprise, hearing her middle name being used by Kaedues. It was forigen enough that she broke character for a few seconds before remembering that it was her cover. **"E-uhm, n-no..."** She mumbled, now focusing her attention on the printers.


[3/31/2025 1:57 PM] Kaedues Staub
**"Unconsciously, we all read in an 'F pattern'. You'll read all of the top of the page, some of the second and third lines, and you will skim the rest along the left side,"** *Kaedues explains with a hand gesture. He begins to fiddle with the printer's settings as he speaks.*

**"Obviously you won't do this if you're trying to study something. This stat is about first impressions, and that's really important when you advertise to anyone."**


[3/31/2025 2:01 PM] Sophie Donovan
**"You sound like a marketing corpo."** She'd remark, sighing as she blinked. A subtle tilt of her head ensued when inquired...  **"Is one of your side-gigs in marketing?"**

{Reactions}
blah (2)

[3/31/2025 2:09 PM] Kaedues Staub
**"..Marketing is one of my main gigs, actually."** *Kaedues sends some info to the printer, and it begins to churn and beep in response.*

**"I am a freelancer. I need to sell myself-- my services. This kind of job does not work without the basics in marketing,"** *He answers her question then.* **"Generally speaking, I offer a lower rate than most as a hook. I do my work fast and effectively so anyone who hires will tell all their friends."**


[3/31/2025 4:58 PM] Sophie Donovan
Sophie shifted her weight from one foot to the other, tilting her head up alongside her gaze as she pondered on Kaedues' explaination thoughtfully; It made sense. 

The teenager brought her head leveled with the ground, casting a glance towards the printer once more.**"I was going to get a job up until everything started glitching out. Just something to earn some micros every week."** She removed one hand from her jacket and made a circular motion with it, emphasising her point. **"There were a lot of things I wanted to buy."**


[4/1/2025 12:34 PM] Kaedues Staub
*The papers rustle and crinkle as Kaedues pulls them from the printer.* **"Hard to believe you aren't already working by 16,"** *He comments.* **"Tell you what, though; I'll show you what it is like. I'll pay you a cut of my earnings if you help."**


[4/2/2025 4:42 PM] Sophie Donovan
The mentioning of being paid sounded enticing—judging by the way her attention was perked. **"I would be okay with that."**


[4/2/2025 4:42 PM] Narration
A customer entered the establishment. But no one they recongized. Minding their own business, they went towards another set of printers.


[4/2/2025 4:42 PM] Sophie Donovan
Sophie's attention was turned towards them for merely a moment before going back towards Kaedues.


[4/2/2025 7:14 PM] Kaedues Staub
**"Come on, then."**
*With the papers in hand, Kaedues steps towards the door they came in from. He happens to approach this person, and stops in his tracks.*

**"Hey, read this, would you?"**
*Kaedues asks the stranger. He pulls one paper from the stack and holds it out to him.*

*On the paper is an advertisement of Kaedues' freelance handyman job. It shows a place to contact him and his commission price.*


[4/3/2025 6:19 PM] Narration
The stranger was missing an eye, a patch covering the hole in their skull. His hair was matted and greasy, shining from the flickering light that provided the room with much needed light. Within his mouth, he was smoking something, jostling the wrapped substance between his lips as he takes it paper eagerly.

The man was shaking since before he accepted Kaedues' flyer. With the notice well within the view of his good eye, he would examine it's contents.


[4/3/2025 6:19 PM] Sophie Donovan
Sophie watched the man with an inquisitive side glance. The one thing that she wanted to know about him was something that Kaedues mentioned not too long ago in the recent past.


[4/3/2025 6:19 PM] Narration
Sure enough, the man's eye moved in that *F* pattern that Kaedues spoke about.  **"A handyman, eh? Yeah... I could plug in one of those... Say, my choom, what do you know about  fences?"** He inquired as his eye never left the flyer.


[4/3/2025 7:02 PM] Kaedues Staub
**"Picket, chain-link, barbed wire.. I've installed a few of each. Know how to maintain them too."** *Kaedues answers. His left hand keeps the papers and his right hand rests at his hip.*


[4/3/2025 7:08 PM] Narration
**"Nova, man...!"** He'd look up toward the red-hair man. **"I got a zone I am renting out to some tenants. Been having a reaaaalllll big problem with some kids trespassing and making a mess of the place."** He would raise the flyer, having the graphic facing Kaedues and tapping on it a few times before pointing back towards him. **"You could put a fence in right? I got all the material ready to go. Just needed some skin to put it in. Ahehe!"**


[4/3/2025 7:08 PM] Sophie Donovan
**"..."** She'd cringe.


[4/3/2025 7:12 PM] Kaedues Staub
*Kaedues listens to the stranger's simplified job detail and shrugs passively.* **"On paper I can do that. How much area am I covering?"**


[4/3/2025 7:20 PM] Narration
**"There are only two shack houses I am rentin' out on some land I lease. Each 400 square feet exact, I can't do those fancy metrics and those uh...decibels? Anyways— I kept everything square, yeah? I keep the fencing in the shed on the property you know."**


[4/3/2025 7:22 PM] Kaedues Staub
*Kaedues' face straightens out and he allows his lungs to bottom out.* **"Got it. Send me the geo and I'll be there ASAP. Expect a delay though, I'm pinning the rest of these flyers up."**


[4/3/2025 7:25 PM] Narration
**"Greaaat!"** He'd tap his forehead, sending the location of 'his' property. In the Stacks and truthfully, not far from where Kaedues lives.
**"I'll be there, getting the fencing out of the shed. Just ping me when you are zero'in in."**


[4/3/2025 7:29 PM] Kaedues Staub
**"Sure."**
*Kaedues nods toward Sophie and moves to leave the delivery joint.* **"Come on. This is an easy job, perfect for learning."**

*On the way out, Kaedues looks down at himself. He changes the way he walks on the way out, maybe dissatisfied?*


[4/3/2025 7:38 PM] Sophie Donovan
Sophie noted the change in his walk. Though, she opted to wait until they were safely out of earshot of anyone before inquiring. **"What was that?"** She asked, casting him a sideglance as Sophie walked alongside him.


[4/3/2025 7:44 PM] Kaedues Staub
*Kaedues glances briefly at Sophie when she asks. His head turns somewhat, where his side profile is still just barely visible along with his eyes which stay glued to her.*

*Before the contact could extend for long enough to become uncomfortable, Kaedues looks forward. Still there is a long silence before Kaedues really answers.* **"Do you hate this place?"**


[4/3/2025 7:45 PM] Sophie Donovan
**"Haven Heights?"** She asks, but she feels like she already knows the answer. **"I do. It smells, it's dreary, and I feel as if we will be stabbed at ever corner. Even law enforcement is against us."**


[4/3/2025 7:50 PM] Kaedues Staub
*Kaedues' eyebrows shift curiously. There's another noticeable pause before his response comes.*
**"Reminds me of what I told Danny about Fairview. I really don't like how anyone acts over there. It feels like I'm a stranger, or something. Like how I feel in a corporate meeting."**

*As they approach Kaedues' home, he gathers the flyers he had prepared in both hands and lines them up by tapping them against his hip.*
**"I don't know what changed, but I feel the same way here now. I have no idea how I have stood this fucking smell all this time."** *He coughs punctually, recoiling from it at that very moment.*


[4/3/2025 7:57 PM] Sophie Donovan
**"Must be the waking up."** She surmised. **"I grew up in Fairview, so I guess you could say I have a bias. I heard Silicon Terrace was better than all the areas combined. But, I don't know anyone from there."**


[4/3/2025 8:00 PM] Kaedues Staub
*As they approach his house, Kaedues stops in his tracks.* **"..Fuck."** *He stops in his tracks, looks down, and shakes his head. With a heavy sigh, he snaps his head upright and walks toward the vehicle again.* **"We're going straight to the job site,"** *He says bluntly.*


[4/3/2025 8:02 PM] Sophie Donovan
**"Oh...Okay.."** She briskly walks back to Kaedues since she did not expect him to stop and then go so suddenly.


[4/3/2025 8:14 PM] Kaedues Staub
*He unlocks the van and climbs inside. He checks the loading bay, and if it's empty enough, he unlocks the rest of the vehicle so Sophie can climb inside.*
**"Need a new mattress, too,"** *He comments to himself with another look into the empty bay.* **"The other one was so much more spacious.."**


[4/3/2025 8:22 PM] Sophie Donovan
Sophie climbed into the van, rubbing her face as she responded. **"I hope you mean for the house..."**


[4/3/2025 8:24 PM] Kaedues Staub
**"Never putting a mattress in that place. It's gonna come down any day now."**
*Kaedues starts the van and pulls out of his driveway...*


[4/3/2025 8:29 PM] Narration
A few turns and two miles down the road was all it took for Kaedues to get to the properties that the man was talking about. Since Kaedues immediately went from his home to the potential job site, the guy was still pulling the sections out from the sizeable shed and from the underwhelming amount of pieces on the ground outside, it appears that he just got started not too long ago.


[4/3/2025 8:32 PM] Kaedues Staub
*Kaedues pulls over at the nearest safe location and nods to Sophie. He steps out of the vehicle and waits for her to follow suit before locking it up and walking toward the shed where that guy from earlier is unloading fence..*

**"Chain link.."** *He comments to himself.*


[4/3/2025 8:38 PM] Sophie Donovan
She follows up!


[4/3/2025 8:38 PM] Narration
The guy was nearly out of breath, his chest rising and falling heavily as he dropped the latest section down ontop of the last. Unaware of Kaedues and Sophie approaching from his right. **"Phew! Deck it, why are these things so heavy?"**


[4/3/2025 8:40 PM] Narration
The property is more like an empty lot with two shacks planted in the middle of a deserted block. The buildings that once dominated and neighboring this place were long destroyed and removed, leaving nothing but large swathes of dried dirt and concrete foundations. There were about two blocks of this... Making the location feel isolated from the rest of the Stacks.


[4/3/2025 8:42 PM] Kaedues Staub
*Kaedues speaks up as he approaches.* **"What is this actually for?"** *He asks.*


[4/3/2025 8:45 PM] Narration
**"Eh?"** The man, still struggling to collect sufficient oxygen in his lungs grunted a inquisitive sound before allowing it to fully register. **"Why, to keep them deckin' kids out."** He would gesture towards... the nothing around them, minus the two shack houses.


[4/3/2025 8:49 PM] Kaedues Staub
**"Choom.. since when has chain link fence done that?"** *Kaedues rubs the back of his neck.* **"Whether you know it or don't you are setting me up."** *He states, gesturing to what little fence is already on the ground.* **"I'm not turning down the job if you're insisting. Still you should know.. it won't work."**


[4/3/2025 8:52 PM] Narration
**"Ugh... What? You mean to tell me that I bought these for nothing?"** He would gesture towards the pieces still in the shed.


[4/3/2025 8:59 PM] Kaedues Staub
**"More or less..."** *Kaedues scratches his scalp..* **"You could rig it with barbed wire though. Still, some of them will get through like that."**

*His eyes slowly pan toward the shacks..* **"Abandoned shack.. you said it's teens heading out there?"**
*His gaze directs toward Sophie and hardens for a moment, as if he were suspecting her or something. Then he looks at Fence Man™️ again.* **"Store bleach in there. Or get rugs with large grooves."**


[4/3/2025 9:09 PM] Narration
**"I can always get barbed wire any day of the week... Would bleach really work on'em? if they do get through?"** He asked Kaedues. Clearly, trusting the expertise of the man.


[4/3/2025 9:11 PM] Kaedues Staub
**"Hard to get comfortable with the smell present,"** *He says plainly..* **"Cleaning the place routinely with the stuff will make it work better, but you don't have to."**


[4/5/2025 8:26 PM] Narration
The man picked a scab, scratching his chin as he pondered the advice that the red-hair man was giving him—they were sound suggestions in his mind... 
**"Would you still do it? If I were to come up with the barbedwire?"**


[4/6/2025 12:39 AM] Kaedues Staub
*Kaedues chuckles dryly and gives the man a shrug.* **"Choom, if you tell your friends you got what you paid for I'll do it however way you want."**


[4/6/2025 9:17 PM] Narration
**"Nova!"** The man would give Kaedues a thumbs up before turning his attention towards his property. He nodded a few times to himself, probablly thinking everything was going extremely smoothly in his head before turning back towards Kaedues. 

**"So uh... How much you think it will cost me to dial in your service fee?"**


[4/6/2025 9:34 PM] Kaedues Staub
**"First time's discounted,"** *Kaedues explains.* **"For you, and for most jobs, that would make a first time 200 micros."**

*Kaedues makes a sweeping motion with his hand.* **"I'm still gonna give you 500 micros' worth of work where possible. Remember that when you pay full price next time."**


[4/6/2025 9:44 PM] Narration
**"Perfect!"** He exclaimed, closing his fist and swinging his arm in a tight hook gesture. **"I got some old shovels in the shed if you need some. Here, let me wire you the payment now and I'll go ahead in the utility shed and generate them up or you two."** Without even missing a beat, he scurried off into the shed. Immediately, they were presented with the sound of items within the structure crashing into one another and/or falling. Moments passed and he came out with two shovels. Both of which were rusted which could been a byproduct from age, the ground water's natural acidity or maybe all the above.

**"Here we are—oh and by the by. Those kids usually come around sundown. Just to let you know."**


[4/6/2025 9:47 PM] Kaedues Staub
**"They armed?"** *Kaedues asks and reaches for both of the shovels. He passes one of them to Sophie once held.*


[4/6/2025 9:52 PM] Sophie Donovan
She would take a hold of a shovel, examining it curiously. Never held a 'shovel' before... These were for digging, weren't they? Sophie then turned her attention towards this guy who was nearly about to explain what he known of these 'kids'.


[4/6/2025 9:52 PM] Narration
**"Hell should I know,"** He admitted. **"You can't expect anything good that could come from them. Some of which might be gang members for all I could recall."** He pocketed one hand and pointed this way and that. **"They come from all over the stacks. Meetin' here with their cars and their little friends. Makes it hard for me to rent these shacks out with all nonsense going on in my property lines."**


[4/6/2025 9:58 PM] Kaedues Staub
*Kaedues shrugs.* **"Fair enough. We'll have this done before sundown, at least. Expect us to leave at some point during, but we'll be back,"** *He says. He pushes the shovel he has into the dirt and extends an arm outwards. It's almost like he's resting it there.*

**"With the supplies covered for, we can get started."** *Kaedues then turns to Sophie.* **"I'm gonna ease you into it, but you're gonna work a full shift today."**


[4/6/2025 10:00 PM] Sophie Donovan
**"...can't wait."** She murmured.

[4/6/2025 10:08 PM] Narration
Kaedues informed Sophie on *what* to do. Breaking down the process of the job so that she could begin semi-independently. Surprisingly, the morning leaning into mid-day was one with no draft and the sun scorching despite its relatively mild temperatures. Of course, for Sophie this was dreadful working conditions. Kaedues dug the initial two holes to get the very first post and chain-link section into the ground.


[4/6/2025 10:08 PM] Sophie Donovan
With the post now in the ground, it was up to Sophie to begin shoveling the dry dirt back into the holes to create the foundation for the fence. Physical strength was not her strong suite and immediately, Kaedues could pick on her utilizing her back too much as she pushes the spade into the small mounds of ash-like dirt. **"..."** Her brow was furrowed as she was already straining—sweat perforating through her pores.


[4/6/2025 10:13 PM] Kaedues Staub
*Kaedues holds the first post in its designated hole. He watches Sophie; His gaze is critical for sure but not necessarily intense like it has been historically.*

**"If you stand up straight and step onto the shovel, it'll become easier,"** *He comments.* **"There's little footholds on the back of the shovel blade you can use to stomp it in too."**


[4/6/2025 10:21 PM] Sophie Donovan
She looked up towards Kaedues from beneath her bangs. At first glance, one may think that she was pissed to be receiving the advice—but you would quickly realize that it was just because she was focused and not really enjoying her tenure as a hole-digger. She immediately adjusted her posture and with the tip of the spade pushed at the heart of the pile, she kicked the little post on the bottom of metal head and drove it into pile. Though, she only got 3/4s of the shovel in the pile before she adjusted her grip on the shovel and just barely lifting it and dumping it into the hole. 

**"Ugh, I would much rather work in retail."** She complained, steadying her breath. Sophie observed the work she had done thus far and to say the least, she was unimpressed with how far she had gotten. A glance behind herself would present much work that still needed to be done. An exasperation escaped her lips as she closed her eyes and rolled her head so that her nose pointed up. Coming back down, she'd grumble some more before driving the shovel back into the dirt. This time, not using as much effort.


[4/6/2025 10:26 PM] Kaedues Staub
**"We're going to be out here for 8 hours. Halfway through, we'll break to eat. You can take two short breaks at any time today,"** *He mentions.* **"Just focus on the action of shoveling, and nothing else. It will make time pass faster."**

*With that said, Kaedues ensures that the pole is facing up and the dirt around it supports the pole well enough..*


[4/6/2025 10:54 PM] Sophie Donovan
Sophie pushed through the labor with what energy she had. She had not taken a single of her two breaks. By the time the sun was now past the apex of the dome above—she fallen into a sluggish rhythm. 

Her hands were aching, fingers protesting and even downright refusing to hold the handle despite her attempts to adjust her grip and pace. Dirt clung to her exposed skin and her hair was damp, plastered to her neck, forehead, and nose. 

She paused, leaning on the shovel like a crutch, breathing through her mouth. Her shoulders heaved and her eyelids drooped as she looked at the section she had barely made progress on.

**"I'm going to die."** She groaned dramatically, letting the shovel drop to the side as she stumbled over to the nearest patch of shade, provided by the lip of the shack's roof. Slumping against it, she slid to the ground with a soft grunt, pulling her knees up and letting her arms drape over them. **"Literal manual labor... in this century..."**


[4/6/2025 10:54 PM] Narration
They had made good progress—all things considered. They were quite literally near the halfway point.


[4/6/2025 10:57 PM] Sophie Donovan
She would yawn, all this labor reminded her that she hadn't slept well the night before. This was brutal!!!


[4/6/2025 10:59 PM] Kaedues Staub
*Kaedues runs a hand through his hair. He tosses his shovel up a foot or so into the air to catch it closer to its center-of-mass and carries it toward the shack where Sophie is resting. He opens it up and returns the shovel to the shack.*

*He's curious enough, though, so Kaedues also gives the area immediately past the door a look.*


[4/6/2025 11:00 PM] Kaedues Staub
**"We're gonna take break now. Come prop up your shovel."**


[4/6/2025 11:17 PM] Sophie Donovan
She groaned louder this time, dragging her palms down her face. **"Give me a few minutes."**


[4/6/2025 11:17 PM] Narration
The utility shed was unremarkable in appearance. Everything within it was thrown in and clearly the contents within the cramped cube have been tossed around and fallen a couple times to give it's charm. There was a window on the far side with a metal plate welded to the frame to prevent anyone from slinking into the shed. Though, with how run-down the door frame for the shed was—even Sophie could probably rip the door from the hindges with practical ease.


[4/6/2025 11:21 PM] Kaedues Staub
*Kaedues sighs to himself.*
**"You get 30 minutes of lunch before you have to get back to it,"** *He comments.* **"You can spend them there or eating something in the van."**

*With that, Kaedues.. just begins to walk toward the van.*


[4/6/2025 11:24 PM] Sophie Donovan
As Kaedues begins to walk away, she started talking. **"Retail,"** Sophie emphasized, eyes closed and head tipped back against the wall. **"Air conditioning, vending machines, breaks where you’re not swallowing dust… I should’ve just applied for that barista job. Maybe then..."** She stops her self short, allowing her feet to slide outwards until her legs went straight with the foundation. 

With a bit of protested in the form of groaning, Sophie stood up and waddled to her shovel to put it away. She'll be joining him, eventually.


[4/6/2025 11:29 PM] Kaedues Staub
*Kaedues glances back at Sophie for a moment before he makes it to the van. Something about her comment earlier makes the redhead think to himself..*
*(This van.. it's in better condition than I remember it.)*

*He raises his fingers to fiddle with the controls and finds the air conditioning. If only to amuse himself, he turns the knob..*
__*Lo and behold, it works.*__ *His eyebrows raise now and he waits for Sophie to get in. Windows are being rolled up. Hunker down, people..*


[4/6/2025 11:32 PM] Sophie Donovan
With much effort on her part, Sophie made her way to the van and opened the door. Throwing her weight around a bit, she grabbed onto the handle along the front interior frame and pulled herself up. Landing on the cushion with a thud, she allowed her head to smack against the back of the headrest.


[4/6/2025 11:36 PM] Kaedues Staub
**"What do yo--"**
*Kaedues flinches as if he'd been shocked or frightened and quickly looks over the seat behind him! He'd forgotten to check the loading bay..*

*..thankfully, there's nothing there. Kaedues softens into the driver's seat again and restates his question..*
**"--sorry. What do you want to eat?"**


[4/6/2025 11:37 PM] Kaedues Staub
**"I'm gonna ask every time. If you don't know, just tell me to pick and I'll go somewhere,"** *He adds.*


[4/6/2025 11:37 PM] Sophie Donovan
**"I don't care..."** She groans. **"I'm too dead to think..."**


[4/6/2025 11:53 PM] Kaedues Staub
**"For this job, you get 100 micros. Once it's done."** *Kaedues explains, pulling forward away from the job site.*

*His lunch spot of choice is a hot dog joint nearby; Sean's. It's a hotspot ran by only a few people who happen to enjoy the process. They're known for their french fries; They come on top of the hot dog as a kind of eccentric topping. Kaedues is a semi-frequent customer, considering his occupation here in The Stacks.*

*The Caliber Man's delivery van slows to a stop on the side of the road near the joint. He turns off the air conditioning, takes the keys out of the ignition and opens the door.* **"We're here."**


[4/10/2025 7:26 PM] Narration
Sean's was located underneath a poorly maintained overhead railway along side other businesses that some how operate here. The weathered train tracks continue to serve those daring enough to gamble their profits by transporting goods from the bustling Stacks to the vibrant town of Kapea. Inside Kaedeus' van, the rhythmic clanking and jarring of the train cars rattling against the iron rails reverberated through the cabin, creating a symphony of industrial sounds that mingled with the faint scent of engine oil and dust.

Sean's establishment was a quaint little structure, its most striking feature a large window that stretched across the front wall, inviting passersby to peer inside and glimpse the activity within. Though, it was lined with iron bars to prevent those from breaking and entering. At the back, a discreet door allowed staff to enter and manage deliveries, ensuring a smooth operation behind the scenes. A lively collection of patrons gathered around this popular spot, their conversations mingling with the scent of delicious food wafting through the air. Across the street, a once-vacant lot had been transformed into a vibrant food court, where people could savor their meals while taking a brief respite from the monotony of their everyday lives. The atmosphere buzzed with energy, offering a sense of community amidst the challenges of daily life.

Two people were at the window, finalizing their order, when Kaedues stopped his van's engine. This was beneficial to them, considering their lunch break was limited.


[4/10/2025 7:26 PM] Sophie Donovan
Hearing Kaedues' voice startled her from the sleep she had acquired while heading to Sean's. It was not a long drive by any stretch of the imagination, so she mustered around 8-10 minutes worth of a power nap. Her lids allowed the light to bleed through a little. The overhead railroad provided shade from the suffocating light of the sun.

At first, the world was just an indistinct blur, a warm haze where sounds blended together. Then, it sharpened as she fully blinked the sleep away. Stretching and reaching for her seatbelt instinctively.

[4/10/2025 7:50 PM] Kaedues Staub
*Kaedues holds the door in an open position and stands right outside the driver's side. He speaks into the car in a manner both brunt and casual; He didn't know Sophie had managed sleep at all.*
**"Come on, let's go. There's no line. We'll be able to finish on time."** *He says and makes a gesture with his head backwards..*


[4/10/2025 8:00 PM] Sophie Donovan
**"mmhmm."** She hummed groggily, swinging her arm towards the handle of the door. However, without effort, her hand smacked against the hard plastic door face and slid down, missing the handle a few times before finding it and popping the door open.


[4/10/2025 8:07 PM] Kaedues Staub
*Watching the way she acts, it clicks for Kaedues. He nods, looks around for any bad actors, and breathes out. Once Sophie's out, he locks the door and closes it.*

*Walking a little slower should help Sophie to catch up, considering how she is sleepy. Kaedues waits at the entrance.*


[4/10/2025 8:12 PM] Narration
Vehicles around these parts were not so common. With this notion, there were plenty of eyes that were casted their way as it stood out against the backdrop of their surroundings. Playing into Kaedues' benefit, no one seemed to move or act upon the duo—yet at least.


[4/10/2025 8:12 PM] Sophie Donovan
Sophie rubbed her right eye, allowing her left to absorb everything around them briefly. Her movement was sluggish initially, but as she too more steps the young girl got into a rhythm of being awake again. **"You said they sold what again?"** She asked slowly blinking and tilting her head up.


[4/10/2025 8:19 PM] Kaedues Staub
**"Hot dogs. Do you have vendors for these in Fairview?"** *He asks. As Sophie approaches the door, Kaedues opens it and walks inside. He gives it an extra bump so Sophie could catch it before it fully closed, if she so chose to.*


[4/10/2025 8:29 PM] Sophie Donovan
You see, opening the door again would require additional engery to be exerted to pull and swing open. That is not to even include the process of walking through the door... This opportunity will not be wasted. Sophie caught up to the door and caught it.

**"Hotdogs aren't common in Cedar Square. Jansville, it is like a staple."** She answered, pulling a rogue side-bang from the top of her nose, back where it belonged.


[4/10/2025 8:38 PM] Kaedues Staub
*Without missing a beat, Kaedues approaches the counter. There's still a line, however short, so the gofer opts to make some small talk while he waits.*

**"In Haven Heights, almost anything can give you the runs. If you go to places ran by people who __like__ to make it, it's less of a problem for your stomach. And.. more of a problem for your account."** *He chuckles to himself.*

**"This place is worth it, though."**


[4/10/2025 8:51 PM] Sophie Donovan
**"...oh."** That did not instill much confidence in Sophie. Where was the nearest bathroom again? She would certainly have to make note of any she finds.


[4/10/2025 8:51 PM] Narration
The people in front of them received their orders and walked past. The smell of fresh hot dogs, accompanied by fries as a topping, assaulted Sophie's nostrils. Regrettably, her stomach immediately grumbled. Was it because the food smelled good, or was her stomach already upset? She scrunched her nose a little.


[4/10/2025 8:57 PM] Kaedues Staub
*Naturally, Kaedues steps into line. His order comes quickly and effortlessly; he's been here enough times to omit looking at their menu.*
**"Hey,"** *He opens up casually.* **"Could I get two #1's?"**


[4/10/2025 9:11 PM] Narration
The man behind the counter looked up with a grin that practically split his weathered face. He wore a stained apron and a baseball cap that had seen better days, his name—Sean—sitched in dull thread above the brim. His forearms were beefy, dusted with salt and pepper hair and a sheen of sweat from working the grills behind him.

**"Kaedues, my man,"** Sean barked with a familiarity that came from repeated lunchtime visits. **"Back again finally, huh? Two number ones coming up."** He reached for the orders slip and scribbled it out with a long pencil. **"Got yourself a little-missy with you today? Girlfriend's kid or something?"**  He inquried as he continued to write some things down.


[4/10/2025 9:18 PM] Kaedues Staub
*Kaedues nods at Sean thankfully before actually registering the man's question.* **"Oh, her? Yeah. This is--"**
*The red-head pauses for a moment. He turns to Sophie.* **"Y'feel like giving a greeting?"** *He asks her directly.*


[4/10/2025 9:27 PM] Sophie Donovan
Sophie shot a glance towards Kaedues' before looking at the top of the counter, processing the information and the hint being provided to her. With her answer now *there*, she blinked and returned her gaze towards who she believed to be this *Sean* **"I'm Charlee.."**


[4/10/2025 9:27 PM] Narration
Sean would give an endearing laugh, **"She looks tired, you got her doing work?"** He inquired as he finished writing down the order and handing it off to an aide.


[4/10/2025 9:33 PM] Kaedues Staub
*Kaedues nods in acknowledgement.*
**"Yeah, choom. She's got to learn sometime, and at least she doesn't have to get shilled if I'm the one monitoring her hours and shit."**
*His arms cross.* **"We're doing this guy's fence not far from here. Honestly the project will probably fluke, but if it does, I told him so. I'll get publicity from it."**


[4/10/2025 9:37 PM] Sophie Donovan
**"I hate shovels."** She muttered.


[4/10/2025 9:37 PM] Narration
Sean let out a raspy chuckle and waved to someone in the back. **"Rina! Two dogs up! One for the regular, and one for the shovel-pusher!"** He looked back toward Kaedues. **"You want 'em stacked the usual way?"**


[4/10/2025 9:37 PM] Kaedues Staub
**"Yeah, for sure."**


[4/10/2025 9:43 PM] Narration
**"You got it."** Sean leaned his elbow against the counter and gave Sophie a once-over—not the kind of look that pried, but the kind that came from recognizing tired labor when he saw it. **"Hey kid, first day’s the worst. You’ll learn to hate it less over time... maybe."**


[4/10/2025 9:43 PM] Sophie Donovan
Sophie offered a weak smile. A febble smile that screamed that she wanted none of this anymore as she muttered, **"I think I’d rather lose a toe than do another four hours."**


[4/10/2025 9:43 PM] Narration
Sean barked a short laugh. **"That’s the spirit!"** Then, with a more serious tone, he added, **"Hope you brought gloves. If not, someone down the road sell cheap ones. Saved more than one greenhorn from tearing their hands up too bad."**

Behind him, Rina, a older woman with a blue bandana tied around her short, bleached hair, was already moving fast. Her arms were a blur of practiced motion—tongs snapping up steaming hot dogs, fries tumbling into baskets, sauces applied with perfect slaps and drizzles. She didn’t speak, but gave Kaedues a nod across the partition.

**"Dogs'll be done in five,"** Sean said, slapping the order bell with a casual flick. **"I assume you guys grabbing and going?"**


[4/10/2025 9:47 PM] Kaedues Staub
**"Huh, gloves. I used to use those.. maybe it's not a bad idea."**
*He returns Rina's nod and then directs his attention to Sean again.* **"Yeah, we'll be out ASAP. Thanks for your time."**

*After a pause, Kaedues pockets his hands. His lips part subtly as he considers his phrasing..*
**"You heard of the new firmware, yeah?"**


[4/10/2025 9:53 PM] Narration
Sean looked around before returning his attention towards Kaedues. **"Who hasn't? They've forced nearly __everyone__ in Littleton on it. The decked up part is that hardware ain't like it is for those preppy uptown people in Fairview."** 

He wiped his hands on a towel as he continued. **"I've heared from numerous people that people they knew got.. you know—zeroed upon installation. Circuit fires and complete firmware lockups leaving them brain dead."**

**"Whatever they updated, in my opinion is more than simple tracking and recongition specs. It's only a matter of time before these cyber psycho come running us down."**


[4/10/2025 9:58 PM] Kaedues Staub
*Kaedues breathes in slowly. There's a short story told by Sean's management of the topic.* **"I spoke to someone who got it installed."** *He breathes in and out.* **"..Couldn't tell, honestly. Be careful, alright?"**


[4/10/2025 10:00 PM] Narration
**"You as well, man... I'll have Rina bring out your order to ya. So you're not standin' around."** Sean gave Kaedues a thumbs up


[4/10/2025 10:02 PM] Kaedues Staub
**"Right,"** *He says and walks out of the joint. This time, he holds the door open for Sophie.* **"Trust me, you'll stomach it. You haven't had 15 yet anyway, so nothing could happen."**


[4/10/2025 10:06 PM] Sophie Donovan
**"15...? 15 hotdogs?"** She questioned, exiting the establishment.


[4/10/2025 10:08 PM] Kaedues Staub
**"No, meals."**
*After checking the ground for used needles and other dangerous objects, Kaedues sits down outside the hotdog joint. He looks up at the sky, and his eyebrows squish together in distaste.*


[4/10/2025 10:08 PM] Kaedues Staub
**"About 1 in 15.. that's how often good food over here will still be bad. It can even look and smell good."**


[4/13/2025 7:39 PM] Sophie Donovan
She stood off to Kaedues's side, looking down at him during the duration of his elaboration. **"To be honest, I would be surprised if the odds were any better."** 

The reflection of something flashed in the corner of the Sophie's eyes, prompting her to look into the direction of the disturbance; A vehicle, backing up into a shaded area beneath the railway. There was no mistakening it, that was a Ion Enforcer. Those bathtubs the CCR love to drive. The distance, combinded with the tinted windows prevented Sophie from seeing who it was within the SUV. But, it doesn't take a scientist to know who they were—those guys who were following Kaedues.

Sophie made a momentary furrowing of her brow before she spoke up. 

**"Those lawmen are following us—Just down the road, beneath the train tracks."** She stated.


[4/13/2025 8:08 PM] Kaedues Staub
*An unspoken and maybe unseen tension in the man's face releases with Sophie's statement. He looks to the side in her direction; cocking his head so his eyes can actually track onto the girl.*

**"They're gonna get paid to stalk us for four hours,"** *Kaedues says dryly. A stifled laugh emerges from him, accompanied by a palm to the face.*


[4/13/2025 8:23 PM] Sophie Donovan
**"For how eager they are. It's making me worry that they'll start to become impatient."** Diverting her attention back down towards Kaedues.


[4/13/2025 8:28 PM] Kaedues Staub
*Kaedues' expression hardens at the admission.* **"mm.."** *He brings a hand to his chin, wrapping a finger and thumb around it. His eyes drift upwards as he considers what she said.*

**"..You know, you might be right. Maybe giving them something early that isn't worth the time is a better idea,"** *He mentions out loud.*


[4/13/2025 8:28 PM] Kaedues Staub
*He tilts his head left and then right, like he is weighing his options..*


[4/13/2025 8:34 PM] Sophie Donovan
**"Any idea on how you would do that?"** She asked. Sophie knew they spoke about it briefly earlier, but now was a good time as any to think about it, since they awaited their fresh food.


[4/13/2025 8:41 PM] Kaedues Staub
**"First thing that comes to mind is to find another woman who could pass for your mother,"** *He explains, making a flat gesture with one hand.* **"Show them that 'I' have a secret worth protecting, that surrounds you, where their suspicion comes from. Since this isn't illegal either, they'd have nothing to go off of anymore."**


[4/13/2025 8:49 PM] Sophie Donovan
**"I guess you could try a dating service or something."**  She threw out there, only one could guess why that came to mind.


[4/13/2025 8:57 PM] Kaedues Staub
**"Dating.. service?"** *Her suggestion provokes a raised eyebrow from Kaedues. There are services for this kind of thing?*


[4/13/2025 9:22 PM] Sophie Donovan
**"Yeah, instead of having to go outside and talk to people. You could narrow down the search by interest."** Sophie gestured with the movement of her hands. **"It's a popular choice."**


[4/13/2025 9:31 PM] Kaedues Staub
*Kaedues looks at the ground and crosses his arms, considering further.* **"Well.. In theory, that could work. If they catch me meeting up with many women.. that would play out the same way, as well.."** *He nods to himself.* **"..yeah,"** *He punctuates.*

*With that, Kaedues opens up an internet search for a dating service. Might as well comb through a list if there is one..*


[4/13/2025 9:35 PM] Narration
Kaedues came across a few searches that ended up being the top sites in the subnet.

*SwipeRiteNow*
*QuantumEntangle*
*Clingr*
*DateMyClone*
*DumpsterFlame*

Were some of them...


[4/13/2025 9:49 PM] Kaedues Staub
*First impressions of any of these five aren't particularly great.. so Kaedues picks the one that irks him the least.*
*He looks into the site DateMyClone.*


[4/13/2025 9:55 PM] Narration
Immediately upon accessing the site *DateMyClone* He was greeted with their landing page. The page consisted of with a message from the company that manages the site, *"You've finally met your match—literally."*

Digital pictures polluted the backdrop of couples of different walks of life. Most of the fashion seemed to consist of what those in Littleton and Jansville would wear, with sprinkles of higher class persons here and there. 

A GUI interface button presented itself, front and center—*"Get Started"*


[4/13/2025 10:00 PM] Kaedues Staub
*Kaedues' face starts to pinch as he reads the landing page. Hesitantly, he clicks the button at front and center.*


[4/13/2025 10:41 PM] Narration
The landing page then navigated to a secondary screen, asking for his preferences. It was quite indepth. Normally, it would be a few questions such as sexual orientation, preferred age, and what-have-you. But no, it was very personal. Asking for information such as what you require out of the other, hair color, eye color, even going so far as to inquiry if you wish to search and browse for specific kinks.


[4/13/2025 10:43 PM] dysplexus
🤪


[4/13/2025 10:54 PM] Kaedues Staub
**"..Oh."** *Kaedues comments to himself out loud. In retrospect, it is a __little__ more obvious what the subtext behind the site was about after all..*

*(I guess people who are very particular would find a website like this refreshing. Still..)*
*He happens to browse through the list of filters for kinks. It was a mistake un-collapsing the list.*
*(I don't.. want to find out if I like any of these things.)*

*Without a second, and arguably without even a first thought, Kaedues closes this browser tab and navigates to another one from his prior search; QuantumEntangle.*


[4/13/2025 11:08 PM] Narration
Simiarly to DateMyClone, he was greeted with a homepage with a slightly varying tone in delievery. Whereas DateMyClone was deep on high constrasting greens and blues. QuantumEntangle took on more of a romanatic and passionate spin on the dating scene; Rich purples, oranges and reds.

*"Collapse the dating wavefunction — with one perfect match."* 

It was punctual, out of the way for the backdrop that hosted a couple at a high-end resturant, smiling and talking. A android bulter awaiting its command at the corner. *"Find your match, today."* awaited him just below the image. Below that were testimonies from those who used the application. Their names being their account handles.


[4/13/2025 11:10 PM] Sophie Donovan
**"Find anything?"** She asked inquisitively. All she could see was Kaedues staring off into space.


[4/13/2025 11:12 PM] Kaedues Staub
**"More than I wanted to.."** *Kaedues mentions as he continues surfing the net. He scrolls through the page. What kind of testimonials are there?*


[4/14/2025 5:36 AM] Narration
The testimonial section was styled like a starfield—white, serifd text over a deep nebula gradient, ach quote twinkling in and out like blinking starlight.

@EntangledWithEli: *"I met someone who finishes my equations... and sentences. 99.9% match probability. The .1% is because he likes pineapple on pizza. Worth it."*

@SpookBaeAction: *"I used to believe in chance. Now I believe in entanglement. We live on the opposite ends of the world, but when I cry, he texts. It's creepy. I love it."*

@CollapseThis❤️: *"I dated myself in three timelines. But this? this feels like the real one."*

@QuarkyChic: *"We argued about wave-particle duality on our first date. Been married five years. Our fights still end in cuddles."*

@HiggsSnuggleBoson: *"I didn't just find a partner. I found a particle whose spin matches mine in every universe... Swipe right or be forever alone."*


[4/14/2025 9:47 AM] Kaedues Staub
*(This is impossible. Is this supposed to be a dating service for physicists..?)*

*An audible grumble punctuates Kaedues' dismissal of the site. He closes the browser tab again. This time Kaedues re navigates to the site.. DumpsterFlame.*

[4/14/2025 11:22 AM] Narration
DumpsterFlame was certiainly a more minimalist designed front. Opting to use very muted colors and spacious elements to keep things from becoming 'clustered'. A testimate to this design was the lack of a slogan. Of course, there were pictures of couples which had a healthy blend of those of different social classes and orientations.

Kaedues would be prompted with a search feature. Searching by the basics; Age range, sexual orientiation, precinct (Haven Heights, Fairview, Neon Kyrie), and (*interestingly enough*,) commitment desires which ranged from temporary all the way to marraige.


[4/14/2025 11:56 AM] Kaedues Staub
*This website's first impressions are much more positive than the last two for Kaedues. He looks now for a place to sign up to begin searching for a 'match'...*
**"..I want you to know that tests for STIs are very rare around here. You don't strike me as the type.. but still."** *Kaedues speaks up as he sifts through the page.*


[4/14/2025 7:19 PM] Sophie Donovan
Where did this come from. It was a statement that caught her off-guard and she visibly shrunk back in digust. **"I don't want to have this conversation."**

It was not long before Kaedues came across the sign-up button which again, prompted him to use the filter with the creation of an account. From there, he would be able to search!


[4/15/2025 3:00 AM] Kaedues Staub
**"That was all I had to say, anyway."** *Kaedues glances very briefly at Sophie..* **"Found a webpage."**

*Kaedues inputs his own details to create an account.*
*__Age:__ 26*
*__Precinct:__ Haven Heights*
*__Commitment Length:__ On and off*
*__Sexual Preference:__ Straight*

**"Something about this rubs me the wrong way. Not the idea.. just the websites all together."**


[4/17/2025 8:23 PM] Narration
The interface took a moment to send the information to the server and return a new page to the red-haired man. A tab labled, "Daily Picks" was the largest gui element out of the others which were, "Members", "Filter Search", "Profile", and "Surprise Me".


[4/17/2025 8:23 PM] Sophie Donovan
She shrugged, revealing some information in the process. **"A friend I know used one."** Sophie stated, now looking around their surroundings for a moment of time before settling back towards the occupied Kaedues.


[4/17/2025 8:35 PM] Kaedues Staub
*To Kaedues' use-case, the filter search is most useful. Where possible, he tries to narrow down what he could be shown to women between 25 and 35 who have white skin and black hair.*

*(Not many people have green eyes.. but I guess I should at least try.)*
*The search filter is amended to include a preference for women with all of the listed features and green eyes.*


[4/17/2025 9:25 PM] Narration
Kaedues's search began to populate with profiles of women who matched or got close to his preferred filtered search. Green eyes were certainly an uncommon trait, and it showed in the number of returned results.

For all the women in Haven Heights who matched the filter specifications and were on the site, Kaedues only mustered 74 return queries. There were only two women who were similar to Sophie.

**Blythe Arlen**, 32, lives between Kapea and The Stacks and is employed as a *'Precinct Utility Claims Clerk'*, meaning that she has some ties with the government in some capacity.

Based on her profile, she seems like the kind of bureaucrat who still wears her badge pin even when off-duty—proud of her work, even if everyone else writes her off as a drone. After digging into her occupation, one would find that she logs infrastructure failures in Haven Heights, disputes billing anomalies, and files reports no one reads. But that also could mean she hears and sees things when no one realizes she's the *wall with ears*.

The second and last woman who could pass off as Sophie's mother was **Naomi Ferrix**, 27. Her occupation was "Bot Enthusiast." Oh, Kaedues knew what that was—in this case, a middleman or woman who brokers items of interest.

Be it information, discreet packages, or specialty tech, she's the middle layer—the gate that funnels the goods, almost literally. The casual slang for the act is "Threading the Wire, " which is dismissible if you don't know better. It means you're a clean conduit for dirty logistics—someone who can pass volatile goods, black market info, or hot gear across city sectors without raising alarms.

She lives in The Stacks, but going with Naomi would be dangerous if it hadn't been a trap.


[4/17/2025 9:42 PM] Kaedues Staub
*Kaedues' eyes narrow as he considers the two fitting options presented to him. He blinks, first quickly and then slowly.*
*(It's difficult to.. put this into the rest of our story. These biographical sections are.. well, they tell a lot more than they might think they do.)*

*He raises one hand to his head. He clutches his skull...*


[4/17/2025 9:48 PM] Kaedues Staub
**"...Huh.."**
*Kaedues muses out loud. His eyes close now as he thinks.* **"They're gone,"** *He mutters to himself with a tone that sounds detached; like he had lost something he never particularly cared about.*

**"..charlee, have you ever spent much time around government workers?"** *He asks now, his voice quiet and reserved.*


[4/18/2025 11:56 PM] Sophie Donovan
She gave him the simple nod of her head. But it would go without something to say along with that.

**"Mom had several acquaintances in the government."**


[4/19/2025 1:35 PM] Kaedues Staub
**"Have you ever heard of or met a Blyth Arlen?"** *Kaedues responds.*


[4/19/2025 5:30 PM] Sophie Donovan
Sophie thought about it. Her eyes searched the corners for any loose connections associated with the name. **"No, the name doesn't trigger anything."**


[4/19/2025 7:18 PM] Kaedues Staub
*(On one hand, getting involved with this Blythe woman could be a fast track to selling myself out,)* *Kaedues thinks to himself.* *(On the other hand, that Naomi woman has good enough reason to investigate Sophie.. if only to sell the info to the highest bidder.)*

**"I am upset to admit I don't have any other ideas. Both of these women are bad choices, but I agree with you when you say these cops will eventually cave."**


[4/19/2025 7:21 PM] Kaedues Staub
*Kaedues' fingers tighten around his temples so tightly that his knuckles become pale white.*
**"Something is giving.. something is giving, and.."**


[4/19/2025 7:29 PM] Sophie Donovan
**"...Maybe we could ask Doug if he could help?"** She suggested.


[4/20/2025 3:10 PM] Kaedues Staub
*Kaedues bookmarks the website DumpsterFlame when Sophie makes her suggestion. He releases his own skull from the monstrous grip of his fingers and glances in her direction.*

**"It couldn't hurt to ask. Odds of him having a fix aren't great, and there are..."** *Kaedues' eyes begin to scan the area in front of him..* **"..huh."**
**"--anyway,"** *He says with a dismissive wave of the hand,* **"there's a few ways it could go wrong. I don't know this guy very well, or how he solves problems."**


[4/20/2025 3:13 PM] Kaedues Staub
*Kaedues raises a hand and points at Sophie. His wrist is slacked and his finger hangs slightly, draining any accusation from the gesture.* **"You align well, so far, with the way I tackle problems. One step at a time, if even that. You don't like to take risks, either."** *Now his hand drops to his side.* **"A part of me worries he'd take the request and run with it. He seems like the type to charge in at the first good idea."**


[4/20/2025 4:28 PM] Sophie Donovan
Sophie sheepishly glanced away. `("Yeah, Doug did strike me as the character to do the most on a whim.")` 

Her eyes darted back to the shadowy spot where the agents had been lurking moments before. The sleek vehicle that had provided them cover was now a ghost, vanished into the void.**"Nothing can be too simple."** Sophie stated out loud.


[4/20/2025 4:28 PM] Narration
Rina appeared from behind them with their food bagged. **"Here we are,"** the older woman articulated. Holding up and out the chow they have recently paid for.


[4/20/2025 4:28 PM] Sophie Donovan
Sophie turned around and accepted the food. Completely blindsided by the hurried arrival and gesture. **"T-thank you."** Sophie said, just now processing what was in her hands.


[4/20/2025 6:24 PM] Kaedues Staub
*Kaedues' head flicks over to the side as Sophie is given their order. His eyes then quickly trail over to Rina and he nods.*
**"We appreciate it,"** *He follows up.*

*Kaedues nods toward his van and begins walking to it as well.* **"Come on, we can eat in the van. I need to think about our options, too.. but it can wait until the day's over."**


[4/20/2025 8:00 PM] Narration
The two re-entered the van with Sophie setting the bag of food onto the dash while she haggled with her seatbelt.


[4/20/2025 8:00 PM] Sophie Donovan
**"Remember when you asked if I knew any government officials?"** she asked, now fumbling with the bag in her hands.


[4/20/2025 8:02 PM] Kaedues Staub
**"Yeah?"** *Kaedues says as he closes the door. He glances down at the bag holding their food, and then at her.*


[4/20/2025 8:11 PM] Sophie Donovan
She hands him a container, encompassing his portions before rummaging with her own.

**"I might someone who could help us."** Sophie opened her own and looked at the ensemble before her. It looked really really good…

**"Before everything went to hell, my mother was busy renewing my certificates. If I am correct, my certificates weren’t renewed so my records expired."** She would raise her dog and take a plentiful bite out of it. Her eyes lit up in delight.

**"I know a guy who could get me renewed certificates. With modifications."**

She allowed herself something time to chew before elaborating. **"If those deckheads ask for them. It would shred any reasonable doubts they might have."**


[4/20/2025 8:12 PM] Sophie Donovan
**"I’d *legally* be you and Noelle’s ‘kid’ if we could get them renewed with the edits."**


[4/20/2025 8:38 PM] Kaedues Staub
*Kaedues takes the container and looks at it. After a moment of consideration, he just sets it onto the dash in front of him. What Sophie is talking about seems more important anyway, and he's not feeling very hungry regardless.*

**"Did you only just remember you knew this person?"** *He asks.*


[4/20/2025 9:49 PM] Sophie Donovan
**"I haven't given him much thought until now."** She admitted. **"If it is too much of a hassle, we could do something else. There is no telling if he'll be able to help us."**


[4/20/2025 9:57 PM] Kaedues Staub
**"That makes sense,"** *He says with a nod.* **"A legitimate certificate is better in theory than trying to deal with either one of those women."**

*Now, the red-haired man studies Sophie's face for a moment.* **"You look like you like it."**


[4/20/2025 10:07 PM] Sophie Donovan
Sophie gave Kaedues a sidelong glance. Her eyes were as wide as the variety of flavors registered. The observation of her enjoying the meal was an understatement at best. A fry managed to escape the clutches of her lips and fell back into her own container. **"mmhmm."** She acknowledged.


[4/20/2025 10:10 PM] Kaedues Staub
*With Sophie at least halfway through her meal, Kaedues starts the van and begins checking his mirrors and blind spots.* **"Can you tell me anything about this person who can renew your certificates?"**


[4/22/2025 9:15 PM] Sophie Donovan឵
Sophie carefully lowered her hands into the deep styrofoam container, gently setting her meal aside before fully engaging in the conversation about her relationship with this mysterious *person*. As she took a few thoughtful bites, savoring the rich flavors of her food, she felt a slight tinge of emotion swirl about her head. 

**"His name is Aus. He doesn't directly work with the government... But his father does, and knowing Aus, he would bend a rule or two for me."**

 She became a bit bashful towards the end. Hinting at a much deeper connection with this 'Aus' character.


[4/23/2025 1:59 PM] Kaedues Staub
*There's something about the way she spoke that causes Kaedues to interrupt his own routine and look at Sophie again. His eyes briefly gloss over her, at her head and shoulders to assess her body language.*

*(She's shrinking on herself. If she likes him, it could bring into question whether or not this tip is good at all.)*
*Kaedues' eyes, and by extension his head, slowly trail to the windshield. He begins to pull away from the shop toward the job site again.*

**"Aus... Know his last name?"**


[4/24/2025 6:59 PM] Sophie Donovan
**"Moore. It's Moore."** She responded.


[4/24/2025 7:07 PM] Kaedues Staub
*Kaedues takes his time to respond this time. In the interim, the ambient grungy noise of Haven Heights populates the atmosphere, although dulled through the closed doors of the delivery van.*

*When he does respond, he sounds hesitant, or pensive.*
**"I trust your idea. It's worth trying."**


[4/24/2025 7:14 PM] Sophie Donovan
The intense feelings that had built up inside her were now breaking free, flushing themselves out through her face and being replaced with the heat emitted by the sun through the windows. This affirmation was more than just a sign of support; it was a vital encouragement that assured her she could fully commit to the course of action when the right time came. **"I will message him when we finally get this fence over with... I am confident he will help."**


[4/24/2025 8:06 PM] Kaedues Staub
*Kaedues nods quietly. He breathes in and, before he would go to exhale, his breathing hitches audibly. He starts to take a turn down the street that had led them to this shop..*

**"Keep your motives under control,"** *He says calmly.* **"I'm not gonna hound you about it. Not unless you give me a reason to. You get what I mean, right?"**


[4/24/2025 9:17 PM] Sophie Donovan
**"I'm not going to involve Aus. If that is what you're thinking."** Resting her arm against the door, she allowed her head to rest in the palm of her hand. **"Besides, we aren't a thing."** She affirmed, her tone coming off almost standoffish.


[4/24/2025 9:23 PM] Kaedues Staub
**"By asking him for help, you are involving him.."** *Kaedues says. He checks his rearview mirror..* **"If his father's already in, it makes him in by proxy. Like you."**

*He turns his head to face Sophie but doesn't look at her. His eyes stick to the road.* **"Just be careful, and it won't be that deep."**


[4/24/2025 10:06 PM] Sophie Donovan
**"Alright."** Responding to Kaedues's advice more receptively. Her eyes opened and looked straight ahead, the buildings moving past them as they proceeded


[4/24/2025 10:06 PM] Narration
The pair had finished the work set out for them for the remainder of the day. The sun was beginning to dip towards the west, and Kaedues was now pulling into his property.


[4/24/2025 10:14 PM] Kaedues Staub
**"That's a job done. Work hard during the day and sleep so you hopefully have enough energy to do it again tomorrow. Kind of like school for you, I bet."**
*The van comes to a soft stop and Kaedues pulls the keys from the ignition. With the engine off, the interior sounds much quieter..*


[4/24/2025 10:23 PM] Sophie Donovan
She glared daggers at Kaedues. `("Another day of this? This was labor for slaves.")` She thought. The glare did not last long; she did not have the energy to be upset over a comment so small. Besides, she had been dealing with the situation with Aus for the car ride back to Kaedues' place.

Her eyes illuminated on and off as she exchanged correspondences with Aus until they returned. Now, she was exasperated and opened the van door.


[4/24/2025 10:27 PM] Kaedues Staub
*Kaedues shrugs. He watches Sophie leave the van, and then promptly gets out himself.*
*(It isn't unlike a person to be upset after their first day of work. She'll become more neutral to it toward the end of the week.)*

*After locking the van up, Kaedues paces himself to the curb. He surveys his surroundings...*


[4/25/2025 7:32 PM] Narration
The evening enveloped the neighborhood in an unusual stillness, a quiet stretching deeper than the usual calm. The heat radiating from the gravel road began to seep into the cool evening air, a tangible reminder of the day’s warmth. In the distance, Kaedues spotted the aerial patrol vehicles, gliding lazily just above the city skyline. Their powerful spotlights pierced through the deepening shadows left by the retreating sun, illuminating specific patches of Haven Heights. In that direction lay the Metro entrance that Kaedues frequented recently, though anyone would doubt the patrols had any genuine interest in it or even knew of it.

On another note, that CCR patrol unit has not revealed itself to Kaedues and has remained out of sight for the entire second half of his day. It was not as if they needed a line of sight to track the utility van. Across the street, an older gentleman was slowly pushing a shopping cart filled with his belongings down the length of the dirt sidewalk.


[4/27/2025 7:40 PM] Kaedues Staub
*At first, it's nothing; A sinking feeling in the stomach for sure, but that's normal. Any person would discard a general feeling of discomfort if they lived here. When Kaedues recognizes where it comes from-- that prolonged quiet-- he finds himself surveying the area again, as if he would find some convenient detail that would explain away his situation. Where are the tweakers and jump junkies? Where are the gangs, the muggers?*

*__..Where are the lawmen?__*

*(It's not like there are many out usually, but never this little...) Kaedues monologues internally. He prompts himself to close his eyes and recall a time where he was told..*
-# *`"...so-called Vesperian Legionnaires have been disruptive to biz this last week. Made the CCR their plaything and took over all internal security operations."`*

*His eyes open slowly. If what that man said should be taken at face value, that means... This is an orchestrated quiet. There is an order here, larger than any group of persons.*
*(It means that.. now or very soon, I'll be in the dark. I'll be unknowingly acting inside the box these guys are making.)*

*The analogy Kaedues thinks up seems to strike a little more than he intended. His gut twists in reaction; It feels to the redhead as if he was offered a raise and then stepped on a land mine.*


[4/27/2025 8:44 PM] Narration
No lawmen were in sight, despite the second survey of the area. Keadues found a neighbor down the street trying to break into his own apartment (He does that from time to time.) The gunshots and screaming have been less frequent... It is as he feels. Everything was changing.

One of the aerial vehicles off in the distance would bank towards the east and begin accelerating through the sky, vanishing from sight. In contrast, the others remained in their orbiting pattern in their occupied area.


[4/27/2025 8:44 PM] Sophie Donovan
**"See something?"** Sophie asked Kaedues from the corner of her eye. Moments later, she tilted her head in his direction to see all of him. The teenager had sat against the door leading to Kaedues' home. She found that she could not bear to stand any longer, not after all she had been through today.


[4/27/2025 9:09 PM] Kaedues Staub
*Kaedues' own eyes roll to connect with Sophie's. Once he meets her gaze, like a repelling magnet, his eyes point toward the other end of the street again.*


[4/27/2025 9:13 PM] Kaedues Staub
*The redhead pushes his fingers into his pockets, allowing his knuckles to plug the slip.*
**"Hear something,"** *He responds. His head subtly raises up, and then to either side as he continues to look around.*

**"It's not supposed to be quiet like this..."** *Kaedues says. He watches the old man with the shopping cart..* **"It's easier to say actually that.. the Stacks isn't quiet for a lot of good reasons."**


[5/2/2025 5:07 PM] Sophie Donovan
Sophie curled her legs to her chest and rested her cheek on her knees, sharing her thoughts with Kaedues. **"Perhaps those decked-out borgs scared off all the criminals."**


[5/11/2025 11:22 PM] Kaedues Staub
*Slowly, Kaedues' head tilts down. He looks at the ground beneath him, at first trying to focus on some arbitrary detail somewhere along the pavement. When his efforts turn up short, he closes his eyes. To Kaedues, this is a foreign feeling. Perhaps it is some sort of paranoia, or fear? It is like a slow, methodical blending of the brain.*

**"I don't really know.. but I think you have to be within some realistic.. parameters."** *He responds.* **"...You talked to Aus?"**


[5/17/2025 7:59 PM] Sophie Donovan
The teenager nodded to acknowledge Kaedues' question. The conversation with Aus went as well as it could have went. With her missing school and everything, it was only anticipated that he would inquiry on her absents. **"Yeah, I talked to him. Funny enough, my mother needed me to sign some documents to certify. Made some minor tweaks and sent it to him. If all goes well, I'll hear back about it in a few days."**


[5/18/2025 7:04 PM] Kaedues Staub
*The gofer feels his face scrunch a mite in response to hearing Sophie's statement. Wouldn't certifying be the responsibility of the person issuing her identity?*

**"You needed to sign a document to certify.. what?"** *Kaedues' eyes open somewhat and point toward Sophie.* **"Are you choosing your new supposed name and age?"**


[5/21/2025 2:21 PM] Sophie Donovan
Sophie given Kaedues an affirming nod. 

**"That way, it will send anyone who is snooping into my identity into a cyclic-loop. In the event those bored Lawmen decide to ask for credentials, it would be like the bolt in the chassis for their 'investigation'."**


[5/24/2025 12:48 AM] Kaedues Staub
**"...Mm."** *Kaedues nods; his bit of curiosity retreats into his otherwise occupied headspace. Kaedues' eyes point at his feet, no longer focusing on Sophie.*

**"It's not that late,"** *he says out loud.* **"I don't know if there's enough time.."**


[5/29/2025 8:46 PM] Sophie Donovan
She maintains her focus onto Kaedues. The statement that he had spoken was lost to her.

> "What did that mean?"
> "Enough time? Is he referring to what those people were saying about this whole firmware ordeal?"

The thoughts pushed out of her mind, discarded for more pressing matters which her being told her were more pressing. What exactly were these matters would be up to her to disclose it would seem—her focal point now shifting upwards towards the sky the oranges were soon to translate into indigos and purples. 

Her eyes closed before she even realized they had. A deep and relaxed exhaled escaped her nostiles as her frame relaxed against the house. She was beginning to fall asleep.


[6/1/2025 2:17 PM] Kaedues Staub
*Kaedues briefly looks at Sophie again, and then at the sky. The day is passing faster than he thought, too.*
*(I could try and drop her off... but that would never work. She'd wake up if I picked her up, I'm sure.)*

*Kaedues raises his set of fingers loosely to one of his temples; He initiates a call with Gavyn.*


[9/15/2025 8:34 PM] gardengnostic2
don't ask me why he's calling IDK anymore


[9/15/2025 8:34 PM] gardengnostic2
code orange bro


[9/15/2025 8:35 PM] dysplexus
hmm. So you want to edit it then?


[9/15/2025 8:37 PM] gardengnostic2
nah I'll figure it out king


[9/15/2025 8:43 PM] Gavyn
*Gavyn picked up almost immediately.* `"Hey, choomb, I was just talkin' about you with Carlos."`


[9/15/2025 9:22 PM] Kaedues Staub
*There is something pressing, or important Kaedues feels he has to say.. or there was, until Gavyn spoke. The recent memory of his phone call with Carlos comes to mind.*

**"He's telling you I'm crazy, I'm guessing?"**


[9/15/2025 9:34 PM] Gavyn
`"What? No!"` *Gavyn seemed taken aback from Kaedues' question.* `"No choom, we were talking about you getting a job here at the logistics hub in Kapea. Why would he say you were crazy?"`


[9/15/2025 11:08 PM] Kaedues Staub
*Kaedues clears his throat. Before he answers Gavyn, there's a short but noticeable moment of awkward silence.*

**"My last conversation with the man did not go very well."**


[9/16/2025 8:52 PM] Gavyn
*Gavyn was quiet for a moment, formulating a response to the information that was given to him. Even with the moment of silence, the response came out as unfiltered and utterly all over the place.*

`"I—uh... Sorry to hear."` *This was quickly followed up on by Gavyn, however,* `"Carlos doesn't hold on to things for too long... I am sure whatever it was, it was nothing but a blip in the net. Not once did he mention any static."`


[9/16/2025 9:12 PM] Kaedues Staub
**"...Gavyn, what do you know about Leben, the company?"** *Kaedues asks, his question a complete non sequitur to their conversation.*


[9/16/2025 9:19 PM] Gavyn
`"Leben... Leben..."`  *Kaedues could hear Gavyn interfacing with some keyboard interface with obnoxiously loud response feedback.*`"......Not enough to give you a breakdown, man. We occasionally moved some pallets of their goods from time to time. Why?"`


[9/16/2025 9:23 PM] Kaedues Staub
**"They were audited for having toxins in some of their products... Which I eat all the time."** *He voices over.*
