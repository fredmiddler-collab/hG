[5/15/2023 9:55 PM] Narration
Another Sunday has befallen Shop 1113. This time the largest change was that someone moved the machining table a few inches closer to the mold press since last night. The presence of grease, oils, and that ineffective air freshiner Terrence keeps spraying the workshop everytime he comes out of his hiding hole of an office. 

Kaedues arrived at the shop a few minutes before it was time for him to sign in for work. The door depressurized before sinking an inch into the grooves in the ground. It then slid into the wall slot, allowing him to enter the workshop. He had free reign on the floor immediately upon entering the room. One would have to watch their steps because Danny tends to not put away the tubes for the heavy machines. Which occurred yet again mind you.


[5/15/2023 10:12 PM] Kaedues Staub
*Kaedues steps behind the door. He takes a nice breath of fresh air before the door closes and leaves him with stagnant, ventilated air. First on today's agenda clearly seems to be tubing on the floor. Not a bad way to get some brownie points.*

*And so with weathered hands and a steel-solid work ethic, our work mule picks up the tubes and feeds them back towards where they are connected.* **"Danny, are you here yet?"** *He calls out. Could be quite a lecture for the guy if the tubes just so happen to be dirty.*


[5/15/2023 10:26 PM] Narration
Kaedues's voice had a little reverberation as he called out for Danny, but there was no human response followed. Only the sounds of idling machinery answered. Just when it seemed that Kaedues was alone in the workshop, the loud clatter of a chair rolling across the metallic floor paneling broke through from the narrow alcove just to the right of the workshop door.


[5/15/2023 10:26 PM] Grace Dawson
Peering her head around the corner and leaning back to get a view closer to the entrance, Grace's emerald eyes poured over onto Kaedue's. It was at this point she acknowledged Kaedue and his inquiry, **"Danny has not came in yet."**

🐐

[5/15/2023 10:41 PM] Kaedues Staub
*Kae places the tubes in a comfortable pool next to their respective machines. The way he wraps the heavy tubing around his forearm implies that he has dealt with these things many times before, and will likely have to clean up again later at some point.*

*As he works he comments to Grace,* **"I'll save him the work then. What are you doing over there?"**


[5/15/2023 10:51 PM] Grace Dawson
She would slowly roll back to her workstation, gently tilting her head in the opposite direction and raising her eyebrows to say, non-verbally say, 
> "Well..."
 **"Just finished up some tooling on the receiver James left for me before our daily huddle."** Her hand grasped the main receiver housing of the MK-25 Leopard the team had been working on for some time now. She shifted the parts around, hammering the main housing to make it fit with the frame.

{Reactions}
🐐 (2)

[5/15/2023 11:02 PM] Kaedues Staub
*Kaedues finishes up with the tubes and walks over to Grace. The man himself hangs over Grace's shoulder for a moment to take a look at her work.* **"Solid. Your work looks great, for all my input's worth."** *He pauses, as if thinking for a moment.* **"Remind me again what mods we made to the MK Leopard, would you?"** *He lifts his head up so he's intruding a little less on Grace.*


[5/15/2023 11:22 PM] Grace Dawson
Once she got the housing into the frame, she would pick up what was of the weapon model at its current state. 

**"Well, if I explained this to a head engineer at corporate... I would highlight that this model has seen a modification in the chambering, and mounting position. Trial requirements included increasing the mobility of the weapon and reducing its cost. By eliminating the long barrel and moving everything forward, we are able to reduce costs and improve the delivery of ADS."** 

To show off portability, she folded the stock. Her next step was to slide what looked like a long C-clip into the grooves underneath the barrel of the forestock. 

**"It's actually easier to chamber C clip magazines under the chamber than standard kinetic weapon magazines."** 

She would point to the grooves beneath the barrel where the forward clip could be inserted once the magazine was secured under the barrel. Loading them was even possible for unsteady hands. 

**"Well, it's easier to drop a mag when it's dry with the standard mag, right? Well, there is a secondary hammer underneath the main firing pin which when dry will fire the C magazine right out."** Once she had aimed the weapon forward, pressed the trigger, the C clip would fly off, then she could quickly load the next one without manually dropping it. 

**"The C magazine was my idea...but its not really practical. I will have to revise the idea before the deadline."**

[5/15/2023 11:35 PM] Kaedues Staub
*Kaedues stands up straight and allows his hands to fall to his sides. He nods a few times while Grace elaborates on the MK-25's adjustments. When she mentions that the C magazine isn't practical, it warrants an eyebrow raise from the man. He tilts his head,* **"I don't see why it's impractical. I think hooking a magazine into a gun is easier to do than shoving a box in. Especially if you aren't looking."**


[5/15/2023 11:44 PM] Grace Dawson
As soon as she set the weapon down, she turned the chair partially into his direction so that she could face him more effectively. Asserting a firm grip on her glasses as she pressed them against her nose bridge.

**"It's actually the magazine position that's the problem. The magazine is where your forward hand is resting. When someone who is unfamiliar with C magazines does not release the magazine, the mag will fly off along with their hand still firmly on it."**


[5/15/2023 11:48 PM] Kaedues Staub
**"What you're describing isn't an issue with the gun, though. It's an issue with the person using the gun,"** *Kaedues says all while taking a deep breath in and out.* **"Not to discredit you. If you had to change the position of the magazine where would you put it?"** *He steps forward and reaches for the gun, but stops halfway as if to ask Grace if she's fine with that.*


[5/15/2023 11:56 PM] Grace Dawson
She would in a tight motion, flicker her wrist so her palm faced upwards and sweep her hand towards the weapon. Indicating that she did not mind, Grace turned back to the desk, grabbing a sketching pencil. Simultaneously she would reach underneath the desk and pull the blueprint paper out and onto the tabletop. She would sketch a rough design of the current weapon.
 
**"Good question. A side-fed magazine would defeat the purpose of a compact and easily mobile weapon. Reverting back to the original design would undo all of the efforts thus far."**


[5/16/2023 12:07 AM] Kaedues Staub
*Kaedues picks up the gun and begins to carefully inspect it. The way he handles the firearm is the same as someone who is handling a delicate glass statue.* **"I understand why the change has to be made. Wouldn't it be just peachy not to have to work around the amateurs?"** *Not once does the barrel find its way towards Grace while Kaedues is inspecting it. After a moment he puts the gun back where it was.*

**"You are working horizontally. If you don't mind me suggesting vertically, why not add a cue to the magazine; A sound or feeling telling the gun's user that ejection is gonna happen."**


[5/16/2023 12:19 AM] Grace Dawson
She stopped sketching and looked between the sketch and the gun. Her thoughts were suspended at Kaedues' suggestion. **"Huh.."**

**"It should be sufficient to reduce the rigidity of the internal magazine spring to give the operator a sense of queue. In the case of a vertically fed C magazine, an external feed chamber would be required on either side. This would, however, result in a greater capacity for ammunition."**


[5/16/2023 12:24 AM] Grace Dawson
**"Unless..."** As her eyelids widen, she had a huge idea in her head. Rereferring back to her sketch, she erased the foresite of the gun in the drawing. 

**"We will remove the entire forestock entirely and keep the railing system. The magazine will serve as the forestock. Apply the cheap magazine spring allows us to solve multiple problems at once! Kaedues, you're a genius."** She then finished the sketch, pulling her hands away from as she looked upon the rough draft of this revision!


[5/16/2023 12:29 AM] Kaedues Staub
**"Maybe you would have had the same idea if you gave your head time to rest."** *He points at Grace accusingly.* **"Work is only just beginning now and here you are making adjustments. It's always a good idea to go outside and get some fre..... some air,"** *Kaedues mentions to her before glancing at the door he entered from.* **"It'd be nice if Danny showed up so we can let him know though."**


[5/16/2023 12:30 AM] Danny Donovan
**"Hey hey!"** With all the hooting and holler Grace made, Danny slipped into the workshop. He seemed chipper as always, walking in with his lunch box and his headphone already pumping tunes into his skull. He lifted his hand holding his morning coffee as he greeted them with a broad smile. 

**"What got you all excited this early?"**


[5/16/2023 12:30 AM] Kaedues Staub
*Instead of wasting time with an explanation, Kaedues waves Danny closer with two swipes of an open palm.*

[5/16/2023 12:40 AM] Grace Dawson
She was going to respond to Kaedues but Danny's sudden appearance pulled her from that particular topic to the next. **"Danny listen, so, you are more than aware of the MK-25 Leopard."**


[5/16/2023 12:40 AM] Danny Donovan
He'd accept the gesture, waltzing over to heard the explanation. **"I hope I would be, yes."**


[5/16/2023 12:40 AM] Grace Dawson
**"So, Kaedues here helped me solve some glaring design problems. Instead of working around the forestock, we remove it and transform the entire magazine into the forestock. The mag feed then could be vertically fed so that more ammunition can be stored and cheaper springs should be incorporated into the mag feed to maintain a sound signal when the cartridge runs out of ammunition."**


[5/16/2023 12:40 AM] Danny Donovan
He'd grin, **"This ain't nothing short of amazing! Hopefully, James will not be able to scrap that idea."** As soon as he said that, he excused himself. Even so, he would briefly chime in before completely removing himself from the discussion. **"There is no doubt that James is a difficult person."**


[5/16/2023 12:42 AM] Grace Dawson
**"You're telling me."** She would roll her eyes.


[5/16/2023 12:44 AM] Grace Dawson
Before the though were to escape her conscious, **"And next time don't forget to put away your ventilation tubes away! You're making us look bad!"**


[5/16/2023 12:44 AM] Danny Donovan
**"Can't hear you, music too loud!"** He said from the other side of the workshop.


[5/16/2023 12:48 AM] Kaedues Staub
**"Let's get down to brass tacks."** *Kaedues cracks his neck by sharply turning his neck left and right all while cracking his fingers.* **"What needs to be done today?"** *He asks out loud.*

*Kaedues continues to stretch while his question is unanswered. This much isn't rare to see-- Kaedues often stretches before he works to keep his body capable and flexible.*


[5/16/2023 12:53 AM] Grace Dawson
Seeing Kaedues's talent, she wanted his help with the redesign. She was quick to pipe-up.  **"You could help with me the redesign of the weapon."**


[5/16/2023 12:53 AM] James Carter
**"Actually, Grace, Kaedues is going to be busy today."** He did not bother approaching Grace and Kaedues. Walking perpendicular to them as he continued his strides towards the other end of the workshop.


[5/16/2023 12:54 AM] James Carter
**"This place is a mess because people like you and the night-shifters keep leaving things laying around."** He would approach the punch card, pressing his hand against the biometric screening pad.


[5/16/2023 1:01 AM] Grace Dawson
**"That's not true."** Grace looked offended, gesturing to the workshop outside of her little nest. **"Everything out there is not my mess. I rarely leave this corner for one."**


[5/16/2023 1:01 AM] James Carter
**"And what else?"** He twisted his upper body, with his head turning the rest of the way. James dropped his head low and his eyes high as if he was the better of her.


[5/16/2023 1:01 AM] Grace Dawson
She was socially intimidated by James. Her voice wavering  **"W-well, that's it."**


[5/16/2023 1:01 AM] James Carter
**"Ah of course it is."** Shifting gears, he would return his body so that he faced forward, donning his vest. **"Kaedues is going to be busy cleaning up the place so he won't be able to help you with that disaster of a revision you got going on."**


[5/16/2023 1:04 AM] Grace Dawson
James had stomped on the little flame that she had. Not willing to intervene on James's verdict despite knowing she could really learn something from Kaedues. Perhaps another time.


[5/16/2023 1:12 AM] Kaedues Staub
**"I'll just do both."** *Kaedues says as he walks towards the cleaning supply cabinet at his perfect pace.*
*On his way there, he takes a closer look at the condition of the workplace to see what exactly he needs to clean. At this point, Kaedues doesn't sweat the little details because he figures he will be tasked to do them sometime down the road.*

*Kaedues makes a point to gather a washrag just to put on the back of his neck. It's a little habit he has that lets the people around him know he's getting to work.*


[5/16/2023 1:18 AM] Narration
A mess was to be expected at the place. There was nothing good about Grace's workspace. In such a small space, it is a miracle that she manages to function at all. There are a few things that need to be straightened out around the workshop. It is particularly important to take note of the scattered tables that have served as storage areas for miscellaneous items throughout the workshop.


[5/16/2023 1:20 AM] Grace Dawson
Grace went back to drafting the revision but not without seeming somewhat visibly upset.


[5/16/2023 1:20 AM] James Carter
James just recently entered Terrence's office. So he was out of the picture, for now.

[5/16/2023 1:24 AM] Danny Donovan
Danny on the far side of the workshop working on something big as usual. Listening to his music, bobbing his head as he inspected what looked like a large hydraulic leg.


[5/16/2023 1:47 AM] Kaedues Staub
*Kaedues starts to tidy up by repositioning tables scattered around the room near machines where they might be more convenient. While he does this he speaks up towards Grace.*

**"I can't come over there and look at any drawings you make but I'm free to discuss any plans you have."**
*Kaedues begins to reorganize the items on top of the tables themselves to also fit in with the machines the tables are assigned to.*


[5/16/2023 2:13 AM] Grace Dawson
She sighed softly, looking at her work. **"There needs to be a fundamental redesign of the gun to accommodate a different magazine shape, particularly around the lower receiver. Several internal components were housed within the forestock of the current mechanism."**


[5/16/2023 2:30 AM] Kaedues Staub
*Kaedues at this point has various garbage piled up underneath his arm. The tables are so cluttered that he winds up having to take one of them to collect garbage AGAIN.*

**"Think backwards. Assume the gun must function by a set of rules, and design the gun around the stubborn rules you set."**
*At this point the interior of the shop is looking much tidier. Things may be dusty but they are in order.*


[5/16/2023 2:52 AM] Grace Dawson
She would release the firing pin and bolt at the same. Causing the top receiver to pull apart from the lower end so that she could inspect the pieces. She took a long look before shaking her head.

**"I've only worked with a few designs. The new design would need smaller parts, but this is the smallest I have seen for a sub machine gun. I might need to ask Danny if he has any ideas on part designs."**


[5/16/2023 2:56 AM] Kaedues Staub
**"That's a start. Don't undersell the idea behind it."** *Kaedues takes off the damp rag from around his neck and begins to wipe off deactivated electronics. They'd dry off within the time frame of a few minutes.*

**"I'll take a look when everything is clean. Remember to remind yourself the reason this change has to be made too."** *Kaedues clears his throat so he can be heard more clearly.* **"Ergonomics."**


[5/16/2023 3:03 AM] Grace Dawson
**"Ergonomics.... I suppose limiting the amount of moving parts is key. Moving parts require a lot of space. I will need to use the 3D printer once I get some mock designs in place."** 

Setting the gun parts aside, Grace made progress on making mock-up. Though this process is tedious so she would probably be preoccupied with this alone for a few days if she is dead focused on internal ergonomics.


[5/16/2023 3:12 AM] Kaedues Staub
*Kaedues proceeds with the day as normal. He has a lot of cleaning, organizing, and asskissing to do. All for the dough.*

[5/20/2023 1:00 AM] Narration
It was now Monday at Shop 1113.


[5/20/2023 1:00 AM] Grace Dawson
Grace was working with the 3D printer, printing out some mock-ups of the redesign Kaedues help her envision the day prior.


[5/20/2023 1:05 AM] Grace Dawson
Every once in a while, she glanced up at the digital clock in the workshop. She noticed the clock ticking away the seconds. Kaedues should've been there by now, she thought to herself, but he was nowhere to be seen. That's when she glanced towards the door. Something was **wrong.** Never has he been later than 10 minutes from clocking in.
> "...?"


[5/20/2023 1:06 AM] Grace Dawson
**"Not like Kaedues to be here __on time.__"** She said out loud going back to monitoring her work.


[5/20/2023 1:11 AM] Narration
The door depressurized!


[5/20/2023 1:11 AM] Grace Dawson
Well, fuck work her attention was now set on greeting Kaedues. **"Morning Kaed-"**


[5/20/2023 1:11 AM] James Carter
**"...Do I look like a Kaedues to you?"** He'd flip his arms outward


[5/20/2023 1:11 AM] Grace Dawson
**"...mmn"** Rolling her eyes, she looked away.
> "No but you look like an fucking dyke"


[5/20/2023 1:14 AM] James Carter
**"Why are you so invested in that loser anyways?"** He would ask as he strut on passed Grace to the time clock.. **"Not like he's any good or anything."**


[5/20/2023 1:14 AM] Grace Dawson
**"Yeah, James. You're so right."** She said sarcastically.


[5/20/2023 1:14 AM] James Carter
**"Thank you. You know, you're cute when you actually listen for once... I can see why Terrence takes such a liking into you."**


[5/20/2023 1:14 AM] Grace Dawson
**"Fuck off."**


[5/20/2023 1:14 AM] James Carter
**"Heh."** He felt smug about that one.


[5/20/2023 1:16 AM] James Carter
**"Besides don't worry about him. I doubt we'll be seeing him anyways?"**


[5/20/2023 1:16 AM] Grace Dawson
**"...What?"** She turned in her spinning chair. One arm still on the table with the 3D printer. **"What's that suppose to mean?"**


[5/20/2023 1:17 AM] James Carter
**"...That uhh, since he isn't here. I don't think he likes it here?"** He tried to cover it up as best as he could while still being a dick.


[5/20/2023 1:17 AM] Grace Dawson
**"You did something, didn't you?"** She stood up, walking over towards him.


[5/20/2023 1:20 AM] James Carter
**"Nope. Just an assumption!"** He'd pucker his lips and shrug.


[5/20/2023 1:20 AM] Grace Dawson
**"We'll see about that."** She would move past James.


[5/20/2023 1:20 AM] James Carter
He would turn as she passed, smug as hell. **"Terrence only fucks with you off work. You're making a bad choice here."**


[5/20/2023 1:21 AM] Grace Dawson
She would knock on Terrence's door.


[5/20/2023 1:21 AM] Terrence Whitfield
**"Go away."** Watching the game on his holographic desk.


[5/20/2023 1:22 AM] Grace Dawson
**"Terrence, open up. What happened with Kaedues? Why isn't he here?"**


[5/20/2023 1:24 AM] Terrence Whitfield
With an annoyed exasperation. 
> "I thought it was James. Great....."
He would press a button on the terminal, pausing his entertainment and walking up to the door without opening it.

**"Listen, I don't fuckin' know. Maybe he quit or something. Get back to work and leave me alone."**


[5/20/2023 1:25 AM] Grace Dawson
**"Really?"**


[5/20/2023 1:25 AM] Terrence Whitfield
**"Uh, yeah. Really. Don't bother me until after hours, got it? Got it. Thanks."** With that he would go back to his seat.


[5/20/2023 1:27 AM] Grace Dawson
**"."** She slowly turned away from the door.


[5/20/2023 1:27 AM] James Carter
If there was the shit eating grin, it was James' shit eating grin. **"How'd that go?"**


[5/20/2023 1:28 AM] Grace Dawson
**"Leave me alone, asshole."** She would roll her eyes, shoulder checking him on her way past him. Shaking her head as she worked to contain her inner demons.


[5/20/2023 1:29 AM] James Carter
**"I didn't do anything! Come on, we are better off withou-"**


[5/20/2023 1:29 AM] Kaedues Staub
*The door depressurizes.*


[5/20/2023 1:30 AM] Grace Dawson
She would stop moving to her workstation upon hearing the door depressurize. Looking over into that direction.


[5/20/2023 1:31 AM] James Carter
James stopped at the end of his sentence, looking over towards the door as well.


[5/20/2023 1:37 AM] Kaedues Staub
*A short moment passes after the door depressurizes. A short, quiet, and awkward moment. For even a moment, the air feels like it is falling. This fleeting feeling comes to a halt when the door actually opens-- How much time came before that? A second? Two? Ten? For some reason, it is ambiguous until...*

[5/20/2023 1:42 AM] Kaedues Staub
*A man walks through the door. Whoever he is, he pays no attention to the people inside the room. This person walks through the room familiarly; calm and organized. He takes his time but allows nothing to come between himself and his goal.*

*This figure, cloaked in a recognizable green and gray, walks up to an unmarked door at the midsection of the room he is in. Then it knocks at the door. The sound reverberates through the entire room, given that it is so quiet in here at the moment.*


[5/20/2023 1:43 AM] Terrence Whitfield
He was just getting comfortable had *just* hit play on his video before his hand came down on the button. **"God damn it."**


[5/20/2023 1:44 AM] Terrence Whitfield
He would go to the door, opening it. **"Grace I swear to god."**

*In front of Terrence there is just a man. Just a man standing tall and proud in front of him. Just a man who clearly is unamused by Terrence's demeanor.*
*In front of Terrence there is just a man who looks as if he is here for some formal duty. Just a man who's here on time, like he is contractually obligated.*
*In front of Terrence there is just a man, and behind that man are the lingering embers of hours and hours of discipline lit by internal flame.*

[5/20/2023 1:56 AM] Kaedues Staub
*Before Terrence can process any of that, he is pushed back into his room. The man follows him inside his own office, intruding upon his sacred ground. The door is promptly struck with the back of this man's heel, forcing it to close.*

__***CA--THUNK***__


[5/20/2023 1:58 AM] Terrence Whitfield
**"...The hell are you doing?"** His tune changed quite a bit. Not so demanding now are we Terrence?

[5/20/2023 2:02 AM] Kaedues Staub
**"You aren't going to be asking any questions,"** *the stranger states. His vocal inflection is something a businessman might have. No, a mob boss. Someone coordinated, someone collected, but someone working on behalf of themself.* **"I am going to be asking the questions."** *He points to Terrence's chair.* **"Sit."**


[5/20/2023 2:04 AM] Terrence Whitfield
**"E-listen pal. It's not OK for you to be barging into here like that, alright?"** Even though he was saying this, he complied. **"What's your issue?"**


[5/20/2023 2:07 AM] Kaedues Staub
*The stranger, though not much taller than Terrence, is exerting a presence much larger than himself. He leans in so that he is nose-to-nose with the store's manager, and the intensity behind his glare increases twofold. What is this man trying to convey to Terrence? Nothing good, that's for sure. Things could go south very quickly... can he take the heat?*


[5/20/2023 2:09 AM] Terrence Whitfield
**"..."**

***__"Sit."__***


[5/20/2023 2:10 AM] Terrence Whitfield
With one final sigh, he would raise his hands in defeat as he parked it.


[5/20/2023 2:15 AM] Kaedues Staub
*But the stranger isn't done. He takes a step forward, his shadow hanging over Terrence away from the overhead light. This red-haired man appears much darker in comparison to the rest of the room, blotting it all out with his stature.*

**"You're going to run me through a sequence of events I am sure you are familiar with."** *This person raises his forearm to be level with the ground, and points his index finger down towards Terrence.* **"In other words, you're going to tell me why I was let off."**


[5/20/2023 2:15 AM] Terrence Whitfield
**"...Uh."** Terrence is such a bitch when he's confronted. Seems that Gavyn was right about him being a mama's puss boy.

[5/20/2023 2:16 AM] Terrence Whitfield
**"Wait' woah woah woah! Let you off? That's outrageous."**


[5/20/2023 2:17 AM] Terrence Whitfield
**"Why would I do that?"**


[5/20/2023 2:18 AM] Kaedues Staub
*The stranger just waits. He allows the uncomfortable silence to turn awkward, pressuring Terrence to keep talking.*


[5/20/2023 2:18 AM] Terrence Whitfield
**"Look, I don't know what you're talking about! You're were still on payroll last I checked? Did I miss a payment or something?"**


[5/20/2023 2:20 AM] Kaedues Staub
*More silence. The longer this man goes without talking, the more noticeable the presence of malice becomes within the room.*


[5/20/2023 2:22 AM] Terrence Whitfield
**"What do you want me to say? That I silently fired you or something?"** He wasn't spilling anything if he did know anything.


[5/20/2023 2:23 AM] Terrence Whitfield
**"If there is anyone I would fire, it would be Grace, not you!"**


[5/20/2023 2:30 AM] Kaedues Staub
*The stranger walks around the room for a moment before stopping in front of the office's central holographic table. Said red-headed figure takes a long look at the table, and then at Terrence. He speaks directly.* **"I am being very generous to you by asking questions instead of taking answers. Tell me why. I am not going to say this again."**


[5/20/2023 2:33 AM] Terrence Whitfield
**"OK, ok ok look. It wasn't my idea, alright? Why don't you go ask James? He's the one that said you wanted to leave. I only put under employee release because he kept hounding me about it."**


[5/20/2023 2:33 AM] Terrence Whitfield
**"I want nothing to do with this, your beef is not with me buddy."**


[5/20/2023 2:39 AM] Kaedues Staub
*Redhead pauses for a moment to weigh his options, but only for a moment.*
**"Okay. Now we are going to take a look at this store's surveillance record. You are going to prove that you are telling the truth."**

*The stranger walks around the table now, firmly gripping his luxury leather chair and turning him towards his monitor. The force he applied to the delicate material will leave indentations of his fingers for the rest of the day.*


[5/20/2023 2:40 AM] Terrence Whitfield
**"Listen uhh.. whatever your name is. I don't know the password to view the footage OK? I don't care for that shit so I never used it."**


[5/20/2023 2:43 AM] Kaedues Staub
*The stranger places his thumb and index finger on opposite ends of the holographic table, holding it between the two fingers. He gestures with his off hand to the mark he made on Terrence's chair.*

**"Take a stroll down memory lane. You have 10 seconds."**


[5/20/2023 2:43 AM] Terrence Whitfield
**"Shit."** He would sit there for a moment, looking around as if he was trying to remember.


[5/20/2023 2:44 AM] Terrence Whitfield
He would type something in


[5/20/2023 2:44 AM] Narration
Wrong.


[5/20/2023 2:45 AM] Terrence Whitfield
He'd try something else!


[5/20/2023 2:45 AM] Narration
Nope, try against loser.


[5/20/2023 2:45 AM] Terrence Whitfield
**"What was that stupid password."** He'd close his eyes. 
**"Oh, I forgot I never set the fucking thing."** 123.


[5/20/2023 2:45 AM] Narration
Granted.


[5/20/2023 2:48 AM] Kaedues Staub
*Like a weight being lifted off of his shoulders, the fingers __slightly__ part from the table. The red-haired figure is not so generous to provide Terrence with complete and total relief.*

**"Show it to me."** *He states again.*


[5/20/2023 2:56 AM] Terrence Whitfield
**"I never used this thing. Wait a moment, ok?"** He would say turning towards Kaedues slightly before going back to the computer. **"Uh.. so what? Yesterday or something?"**


[5/20/2023 2:59 AM] Kaedues Staub
**"You are the one who said your employee made that claim. Not me."** *He taps the holographic table harshly. The impact creates a dull, vibrating noise that fills the room for a moment.* **"Show me when he said it."**


[5/20/2023 1:52 PM] Terrence Whitfield
He would look over his shoulder towards Kaedues. **"I told you to relax ok?! You hounding me ain't gonna make me any faster."** Now going back to it, Terrence would finger pick at the terminal before pressing what could be assumed to be enter and moving over to the side. **"Here."**


[5/20/2023 4:00 PM] Kaedues Staub
*The stranger takes a long look at the screen. What does he see?*


[5/20/2023 4:44 PM] Narration
Kaedues would see on the screen what appeared to be yesterday, a minute or so before James entered into the room.


[5/20/2023 4:44 PM] James Carter
He would waltz into the room, closing the door behind himself within the recording. 
> "When are you going to find Kaedues something else? The guy hates it here."


[5/20/2023 4:44 PM] Terrence Whitfield
Watching the game from the night before, annoyed, groan as he paused it. 
> "I'm not obligated to help him with employment. It's the kid's choice not mine."


[5/20/2023 4:44 PM] James Carter
James stood to the side of the table. 
> "He's incapable of such thought. Hell, I am surprised he managed to here. He does nothing but clean up after everyone and odd jobs."


[5/20/2023 4:44 PM] Terrence Whitfield
He'd roll his head, 
> "The kid's labor is cheap and the shop is clean when he works. My boss is happy, so I don't care. "


[5/20/2023 4:44 PM] James Carter
He groaned, a bit frustrated with Terrence. 
> "Hmph."
What he did next was 'itch' beneath his right ear and patted Terrence on his shoulder before leaving.
> "You know what, you're right."


[5/20/2023 4:44 PM] Terrence Whitfield
Terrence would immediately roll his shoulders and begin logging into the employee database in the recording. Pulling up Kaedues's profile and reporting an employee release. Next, he could be heard having a brief conversation with Gavyn.


[5/20/2023 4:45 PM] Terrence Whitfield
**"...Huh?! I don't remember talking to anyone. The hell?"**


[5/20/2023 4:52 PM] Kaedues Staub
*Kaedues looks at the closed door. He lowers his voice to a whisper now to direct Terrence.* **"Did you see that? He touched the space behind his right ear. Look at that."** *The stranger has vanished. Now Kaedues is moreso advising Terrence instead of barking at him.* **"Let me see your shoulder."** *Kaedues looks over Terrence's head at his shoulder before looking back at the door.*


[5/20/2023 8:44 PM] Terrence Whitfield
**"My shoulder?"** He was puzzled to say the least. He would look over to his shoulder. Why would he need that?


[5/20/2023 10:16 PM] Kaedues Staub
**"Didn't you see on the cameras? You got bugged, or something along those lines."** *He responds earnestly.*


[5/20/2023 10:30 PM] Terrence Whitfield
Terrence would pull the collar of his shirt away from himself. Revealing his shoulder blade. Behind it was a small chip where he couldn't see, neat!


[5/20/2023 10:32 PM] Kaedues Staub
*Kaedues promptly grabs and pulls out the chip. He holds it in front of Terrence.* **"I owe you an apology. Looks like my entire speech was meant to go to someone else, huh?"** *Kaedues is man enough to admit when he is wrong. He isn't showing it but he's... pretty embarassed.*


[5/20/2023 10:32 PM] Kaedues Staub
*Mostly at the notion he believed that Terrence had a big enough pair of balls to actually fire him. Doesn't make much sense in retrospect.*


[5/20/2023 10:38 PM] Terrence Whitfield
He furrowed his brow, scratching the spot where the chip was. **"That little shit."** He'd curse. 
> "Do I really want to file the paperwork for James? Man, that seems like a lot of fucking work."


[5/20/2023 10:39 PM] Kaedues Staub
**"I can tell what you're thinking. He's just valuble enough to you where you think firing him is too much work, right?"**


[5/20/2023 10:43 PM] Terrence Whitfield
**"W-n-no?"** He was hesitant, **"Listen man... I'll talk with him. I can't have you running around getting revenge."**


[5/20/2023 10:44 PM] Terrence Whitfield
**"Lets just...pretend that this was some kind of prank of sorts. I'll dock his pay, that would be enough to straighten him out."**


[5/20/2023 10:44 PM] Kaedues Staub
**"I am still within punching distance of your precious sports center."**


[5/20/2023 10:46 PM] Terrence Whitfield
**"A week suspension? Think about it, a week without pay would drive even me nuts and will show him not to fuck with you!"**


[5/20/2023 10:48 PM] Kaedues Staub
**"I have an easier way. Just turn off the cameras for 5 minutes."** *Kaedues doesn't sound like he's ordering this time, it's an offer.* **"I have things I need to say to him that I'd rather keep private. Words that won't do me very good if they are heard elsewhere."**


[5/20/2023 10:54 PM] Terrence Whitfield
He thought about it, Kaedues was really busting his balls on this one. But he was willing to work towards a compromise, **"I can't turn off the cameras on the inside. B-but if you take it out those doors, I put in a maintenance ticket. See if we can't get a technician out to take a look tomorrow?"**


[5/20/2023 10:58 PM] Kaedues Staub
**"....That's all? Okay."** *With that, Kaedues calmly exits the room.* **"Your tires are getting slashed, Peter Pan."** *Kaedues throws out an empty insult before making a calm beeline towards the exit. The door slowly closes behind him. It's time for James to decide whether or not to call Kaedues' bluff.*


[5/20/2023 11:10 PM] James Carter
James was already working when Kaedues taunted him. Looking up and hearing Kaedues say this enticed a response. `🎲7`

[5/20/2023 11:11 PM] James Carter
**"You better not fucking touch my car you shit brain."** He'd grab a lead pipe near his workstation and move to go out after him.


[5/20/2023 11:14 PM] Grace Dawson
Grace had a front row seat to what was unfolding. Seeing James retrieve a weapon prompted her to do something. However, as much as she wanted to her body would not allow her. Frozen and afraid, her mind blanked. She stayed still, watching the scene in horror. She was unable to move or call out, her body completely paralyzed by fear. Eventually, James left the room, leaving Grace alone, trembling and in shock.


[5/20/2023 11:16 PM] Grace Dawson
When James was gone, she went to only person she knew she could speak to. That was not Terrence, oh no. Grace would run further into the shop where Danny usually is.


[5/20/2023 11:16 PM] Narration
But unfortunately, Danny was not in, yet. Kaedues was on his own.


Continuing @ https://discord.com/channels/1106367747727835206/1108071368869814373/1109681500087144498


[5/21/2023 1:58 PM] Narration
The door depressurized again with James reentering the room first. By the time his light scuffle with Kaedues ended, his lip was swollen. His stern expression and fed up look made it clear that he was done with the altercation.


[5/21/2023 1:58 PM] Grace Dawson
Grace was extremely concerned the entire time James and Kaedues were away. She felt helpless as she watched the two leave, not knowing what would happen. She had a feeling of dread in her stomach, and when the door opened, she was not relieved to see James was alright. She was more concerned about Kaedues than she was about James. 

Sitting at her desk she could not help but stare.


[5/21/2023 2:03 PM] Kaedues Staub
*Kaedues takes a visit to Terrence's office door and knocks more politely this time.* **"One last thing and I'll be out of your hair."**


[5/21/2023 2:05 PM] Terrence Whitfield
It took a few seconds, but Terrence came to the door. Cracking it as he peered out with a quizzical look.


[5/21/2023 2:06 PM] Kaedues Staub
**"Make sure you call in that maintenance guy."**


[5/21/2023 2:11 PM] Terrence Whitfield
**"Yeah......yeah.."** Slowly, he would close the door.


[5/21/2023 2:27 PM] James Carter
Got to work immediately, distancing himself from Kaedues.


[5/21/2023 2:27 PM] Narration
The shop certainly has been changed from this point on.


[5/21/2023 2:35 PM] Kaedues Staub
*Kaedues looks around the shop. Though James is distancing himself he would in a moment feel a hand on his shoulder.* **"What needs to be done today?"**


[5/21/2023 2:39 PM] Kaedues Staub
*Looks like he's gonna really need to iron in on this deal. If James does look back at him at all he'll see that Kaedues has a very neutral expression. A red blemish is forming on his cheek already where he got hit-- you can even make out the individual impressions of James' fingers!*


[5/21/2023 2:45 PM] James Carter
He did not bother looking at Kaedues. Still feeling a way towards the guy. He would gesture in Grace's direction. **"She's building prototype's today on the printer. Ask her if she wants help. Danny is working on a big project and needs an extra hand when he is ready."**


[5/21/2023 2:49 PM] Kaedues Staub
**"Thanks. Let me know if you need anything too."** *Kaedues steps back. Since Danny isn't here yet all that there is to do is help Grace out. He walks over to her desk.* **"You said you were rebuilding the gun from the ground up, right? Have you been doing good?"**


[5/21/2023 3:00 PM] Grace Dawson
Earth to Grace, Earth to Grace— **"ah!"** She snapped out of her daze. Come on girl, Kaedues is talking to you. **"Sorry.."** Shaking her head she would go on to explain. **"Uhh, yeah, so far so good.. I talked with Danny and he helped me make some modifications."** She turned her chair and swung her arm towards the printer gently. **"Printed some internals and a temporary chassis so I could visualize what it will take to get these shipped to the dye makers. This is so they can stamp them out."**  Now gesturing further into the building. The Research and Development shop was just one of many within the building.


[5/21/2023 4:56 PM] Kaedues Staub
**"And just when we thought we were almost done... It's worth the trouble though. You'll see."**

*Kaedues takes a look at the printer for a sec.* **"What kind of filament are you using?"**


[5/21/2023 11:04 PM] Grace Dawson
**"Nylon."** She responded with.


[5/22/2023 1:07 PM] Kaedues Staub
**"Alright. Well, let me know if I can help with anything. You have it under control from what it looks like."** *Kaedues nods. While he waits, he starts to tidy up just to be seen doing something.*


[5/22/2023 1:10 PM] Grace Dawson
Without standing, she would wheel her way to the printer to check out her parts. Though visibly, she was still troubled with what transpired.


[5/22/2023 1:13 PM] Danny Donovan
Danny would walk in, chipper as ever. Upon entering, he would scan the room as he pushed further in. Making his way past Grace. **"Morning."** Then, he would move past James. **"...?"** He'd stop, backpedaling and looking at James' face. **"What fucked you up?"**


[5/22/2023 1:15 PM] James Carter
**"It's nothing."** He'd turn away from Danny, clearly not interested in Danny's inquiries.


[5/22/2023 1:15 PM] Danny Donovan
**"Don't look like nothing."** He would huff, walking to his section.


[5/22/2023 1:34 PM] Kaedues Staub
*Kaedues is cleaning. A part of him wants to see how this plays out, anyway.*


[5/22/2023 1:34 PM] Kaedues Staub
*Whistling softly....*


[5/22/2023 1:36 PM] James Carter
**"You should mind your business."**


[5/22/2023 1:36 PM] Danny Donovan
**"Haha!"** He vanished back in his work area.


[5/22/2023 1:36 PM] James Carter
He did not like that. He'd sneer, putting his tools down with a bit of heat.


[5/22/2023 1:40 PM] Kaedues Staub
*Kaedues takes the time to walk over to Danny now. He doesn't even expect him to answer if he called out, so he taps him on the shoulder Kaedues has to extend his handover his own head to even be able to reach him-- what a massive dude!*

**"Danny, what are you working on?"**


[5/22/2023 4:20 PM] Danny Donovan
He was putting turning on the lights on his side of the shop when he was tapped. He'd look over his shoulder before turning towards Kaedues. **"Morning Kaedues."** Now turning his attention to the center of the room, there was a tarp covering a large contraption it was he was gearing up to tear into. **"Running tests for the CCR's Photon Falcon's gatling gun."**


[5/22/2023 4:45 PM] Kaedues Staub
*Kaedues thinks to himself...* **"Consider me an assistant."** *He turns his attention to the tarp...* **"Normally we have the liberty of ignorance as to where the guns go. But to know where it's going-- and that being the CCR?"** *He sighs guiltily.* **"It's just another monday. What do you need to do and what can I do to help?"** *Kaedues asks simply. He doesn't like completely injecting himself into somebody else's task. However he's more than happy to help.*


[5/22/2023 7:45 PM] Danny Donovan
**"You want to help good old Danny? Well, I could use some muscle hoisting this monster around."** He would pull the tarp off the weapon. It was large to say the least. The size of a car perhaps? Featuring 8 rotary barrels, the weapon lack its hull that protects it from the elements. Within was intricate wire setup, onboard computers and systems that are far more advanced than their run of the mill weapons they usually work on.


[5/22/2023 7:49 PM] Danny Donovan
**"The benchmarks we are running will require some fast and strong hands."** He walked away, to a nearby terminal. From there, he would swipe a mobile data pad. Bopping his head to the music he was listening too. **"I'm pulling up the blueprints for it now. Should simply the process since we are working with a lot of automated driven systems."**


[5/22/2023 10:35 PM] Kaedues Staub
*Kaedues walks up to this behemoth of a weapon. He falls silent while in its presence like it is some sort of miracle object.* **"I have never been more horrified and thrilled at once. This thing looks like it would turn a militia into a pile of guts."** *Kaedues looks up at Danny.* **"But we don't just have to move it, yeah? What else are we doing?"**


[5/22/2023 10:39 PM] Danny Donovan
**"Moving it? Nah we aren't moving it from here. That is something the night shift will handle. They move all their serious equipment from BioTek shops at night. Don't know why, but honestly don't care. I get paid the big micros to just do the work, ya know?"**


[5/22/2023 10:43 PM] Danny Donovan
**"Like I said, we got some testing to do."** He'd tap on the datapad once it was it was loaded.


[5/22/2023 10:43 PM] Narration
A 3D projection would come from a dome on the ceiling above the weapon. The holographic imagery outlining the physical weapon. Providing data in 3D space.


[5/22/2023 10:43 PM] Danny Donovan
As he hovered his hand over certain parts of the weapon. Information would reveal itself about the section. Data, the name of the part and its functions. Not to forget the analytics that come with it. **"Perfect opportunity to learn the heavy engineering side of the job."**


[5/22/2023 11:45 PM] Kaedues Staub
**"This beats having to fondle hundreds of pounds of metal just to know what we're working with."** *Kaedues tries his hand at what Danny is doing; He holds his hand over the exposed wiring (given that he can reach it). Kaedues feels intimidated to be in front of something like this. It's safe to say he feels intimidated to help make it too, but he doesn't know that about himself yet.*

*He subtly leans backwards away from the gigantic mass of metal even though he is reaching out to touch it-- like his hands and legs disagree on where Kaedues as a whole should really be right now. Not dissimilarly, Kaedues is getting over the initial chill of comprehending a weapon this large. Not to say he feels threatened... Rather, he feels very conscious.*


[5/23/2023 12:04 AM] Danny Donovan
He would take noticed, **"Ah, don't worry. It's not loaded. They won't give us live ammunition. Haha."**


[5/23/2023 12:12 AM] Kaedues Staub
*Hearing Danny say something like that makes Kaedues recoil and laugh.* **"Gheheh... No it's not like that. I always try to sympathise with the customer. I really shouldn't... It can get in the way of work."** *Kaedues wiggles his hand around, not noticing anything happening.* **"I notice computers on board. Just how many does it have?"** *Kaedues steps comfortably towards the death machine.*
**"You'd have to have a computer to accurately manage the RPM of the cannon itself..."** *He mumbles to himself before looking at Danny.* **"I got sidetracked, sorry. What are we going to test?"**


[5/23/2023 12:39 AM] Danny Donovan
He looked back up towards Kaedues, pushing his bottom lip out momentarily. Looking back down towards the data pad as he continued. **"You're fine. There is a central computer that controls four separate onboar systems."**


[5/23/2023 12:47 AM] Danny Donovan
He would cycle through a few menus on the data pad, tapping once and the central computer would highlight using the Holographic Information Display System (H.I.D.S). Before Kaedues, it showed up as bright yellow in real space. **"That is the central computer. Buried deep within the chassis of the mechanism. Optimal position to ensure proper weight distribution and adequate protection against small arms fire."** He would swipe, a system beneath the gun would highlight red. **"That is the computer's eyes into the world. Capable of positively IDing living and non-living targets from friendlies using RFID. Our chips all link are signatures to the brain of the machine. Has an imaging processor which allows it to identify even individual soda cans on tables. It's absolutely nuts. I'll show you later."** With another swipe, another system above the gun and the forefront of the body; Green. **"RFID is primarily deciphered using this module here. Additionally, it scrambles signals that don't match its frequency. I guess they are afraid of being shot down or something. But lets be honest, typical gangs and thugs don't got the tech to do that.. Kind of a waste of micros if you ask me."**


[5/23/2023 12:50 AM] Danny Donovan
Another swipe, purple. **"That system just behind the gun is the feed distribution controller. Using the information from the eyes and the Deciphering module it can actually put just enough rounds on a person to kill them and not waste ammunition. So you got someone with a guardian protocol shield, it will fire just enough to eat through and take out the baddie in the process. Neat fucking chrome."**


[5/23/2023 12:53 AM] Danny Donovan
**"And this last one is a power controller."** White, at the back of the entire system. **"It supplies power to the entire unit. Don't even get me started on how much power draw this thing takes from the aircrafts. I also heard that they are starting to mount these on some patrol vehicles in higher priority areas. If you didn't feel safe now, wait until these come out on patrols. No one would fuck with you or the CCR."**


[5/23/2023 12:47 PM] Kaedues Staub
*Kaedues is silent and still while Danny GOES OFF explaining exactly what this bad boy is capable of. He tilts his head and relaxes his shoulders as he listens. In response to some of the information Danny mentions, Kaedues shifts his stance more comfortably.*

**"I think I understand the basics now. Thanks, Danny."** *Kaedues starts pacing around the gun, just checking it out.* **"One more time... What about it needs testing? The internals? Or... some sort of connection?"**


[5/23/2023 1:08 PM] Danny Donovan
**"First up, I will be running a combat test... Target acquisition, ammo feeding, and loading failure. Care to be the test subject?"**


[5/23/2023 1:12 PM] Kaedues Staub
**"It's what I'm paid for."** *Yeah, Kaedues already got over it. He stands in front of the barrel at what he would assume is an optimal detection range.*


[5/23/2023 1:16 PM] Danny Donovan
He would jack the datapad into a port on the weapon. **"Grab those sound cancelling earphones from behind you."**


[5/23/2023 1:24 PM] Kaedues Staub
**"Sure."** *He turns to grab the earphones, putting them on. He makes sure they are in a position where they won't fall off and don't need to be adjusted later.*


[5/23/2023 1:34 PM] Danny Donovan
He'd active the gun. The churning and whirling of the power and the internal mechanisms hummed to life.


[5/23/2023 1:34 PM] Narration
A few seconds and the weapon's eye would begin looking around, assessing its surroundings as part of its start up procedure.


[5/23/2023 1:37 PM] Kaedues Staub
*Kaedues decides to pay very close attention to this specifically. Understanding how the gun looks around, how fast it can find objects as well... This is good information to know for later.*

[5/23/2023 1:37 PM] Kaedues Staub
*Also he's literally in front of a rotating gun. That's fun guys, now he knows what it'll look like just before he dies.*


[5/23/2023 1:54 PM] Danny Donovan
**"And... Switching to auto targeting."**


[5/23/2023 1:54 PM] Narration
The rotary gun was facing backwards. Quickly, it rotated and acquired Kaedues' torso.


[5/23/2023 1:54 PM] Danny Donovan
**"Mmn.."**


[5/23/2023 2:01 PM] Kaedues Staub
*Switching to auto targeting...? Kaedues takes some initiative here then. Kaedues squats down to stretch his legs and arms out in preparation for his next moves.*

*He starts to hop back and forth-- from his left leg to his right, then jumping backwards. He dives diagonally backward away from and to the left of the gun; He cushions that dive with a roll. Then he pushes off of the ground with his heels as they make contact. This jump mimics the trajectory of the previous dive. He flips backwards onto his hands before dismounting again. He lands in a crouching position and quickly shifts that into a kneeling position.*


[5/23/2023 2:05 PM] Narration
The gun began calculating his velocity. Being so close up, it was pretty spot on in most cases. Though when he dove and changed directions, the gun had to compensate by working a bit harder. Its whirling sound increasing as it put more effort into correcting its calculations. The last flip threw the gun off. The eye beneath the assembly would flash red but maintained sight on Kaedues. However the gun lost its instructions, resetting backwards.


[5/23/2023 2:05 PM] Danny Donovan
**"...Nice!"**


[5/23/2023 2:09 PM] Kaedues Staub
*Kaedues looks over at the gun. Considering it was keeping up with him that whole time, it didn't change his feelings towards it. If it had been firing, Kaedues would have been hit long ago.* **"Alright... What does that tell you?"**


[5/23/2023 2:12 PM] Danny Donovan
He would stick his hand into the mess of wires, fishing for a specific connector. **"That there is an error. The eye is a indicator on what's wrong. Since all of these wires and shit will be protected with a armor hull. The eye is the one system that is exposed, making it easier to maintenance when things go wrong."**


[5/23/2023 2:12 PM] Danny Donovan
**"However, since I have this little baby in my hand. I know that a connector came loose."**


[5/23/2023 2:15 PM] Kaedues Staub
*Kaedues takes into consideration the way Danny speaks about this machine. Not everyone is so in-tune with machinery that they speak of them like pets or offspring. __He makes a mental note of that__.*

**"My question is, did it come loose because it was placed in a tight spot, or because I made it work too much?"** *He asks. There's a big distinction between the two as well... If it's the latter, then the way the gun works now would actually __conflict__ with the way it is intended to be used.*


[5/23/2023 2:47 PM] Danny Donovan
**"Everything was fine yesterday when I ran the same test. But truth be told, I can't move like you can so.."** There would be a click before he sighed. Pulling his arm back out. **"There is tension where there shouldn't be."**


[5/23/2023 2:47 PM] Kaedues Staub
*listening intently. Kaedues often nods in response to Danny's info.*


[5/23/2023 2:48 PM] Danny Donovan
He would move away from the killing machine while also unplugging the datapad. From there, he went to sitting in his chair inputting the data he saw scrolling through pad.


[5/23/2023 2:49 PM] Kaedues Staub
**"I'm surprised that they aren't using something like a double joint. Since it's meant to move on a dime that is."** *Kaedues raises a hand gently to gesture about what he said.*


[5/23/2023 2:51 PM] Danny Donovan
**"The tension is somewhere further in the assembly. When I went to plug it back in, I had to fight to pull it back into place. Exactly where is the question. Use the HIDS and see if you can't find it real quick as I input the metrics."**


[5/23/2023 2:54 PM] Kaedues Staub
*Kaedues walks up to the machine now. He knows from experience with mechanics to have some hope and assume it's something little. He starts moving his hands around the general area where the cables are positioned. Looking for any small gaps where wires might not be too happy...*


[5/23/2023 3:16 PM] Narration
Everything looked perfect except two binding loops, hooked around a bracket that is a part of the chassis. There, it was clear to see that any tension going downwards could cause some kinds of disconnects. This perhaps would require the connectors to be unplugged and fed back through and sorted.


[5/23/2023 3:17 PM] Kaedues Staub
**"Oh yeah. Some of the wiring needs to be fed around another way, and it might help out a lot. Take a look when you're ready."** *He keeps his hand near the area in question, waiting for Danny's input.*


[5/23/2023 3:24 PM] Danny Donovan
**"Think you can handle it?"** He'd respond. **"I have some extra fasteners you could use if we got too much slack."**


[5/23/2023 3:25 PM] Kaedues Staub
**"Yeah, sure."** *He simply disconnects the loops and tries to feed them free of the bracket in question. Kaedues is careful here, but he is also straight to the point. Does he have enough cabling to work with?*


[5/23/2023 3:59 PM] Narration
He would have enough! Those who put this thing together sure were generous and not stupid.


[5/23/2023 4:01 PM] Kaedues Staub
*Great. He connects the cable in the same spot as it was before. Hopefully the new orientation would help. He steps back away from the internals of the machine...* **"Yeah, I think I got it. Did you want to go through the motions again to see if it works any better?"**


[5/23/2023 4:02 PM] Danny Donovan
He would hold out the data pad to Kaedues. **"Jack this puppy in and reactivate the auto targetting."**


[5/23/2023 4:07 PM] Kaedues Staub
*Kaedues jogs up and grabs the Data pad. He grabs the hull of the gun on one side to pull himself up, inserting the jack of the data pad into the D-Port of the gatling gun. He fiddles around with a menu he hasn't seen yet... but eventually does figure it out. The gun is placed into Auto-Targeting mode... Kaedues sets the data pad down on a free space before moving back in front of the gun.*

*Kaedues moves slowly at first, just to see if the gun's tracking is working. He walks far to the left and to the right to properly gauge the range of motion of the gun.*


[5/23/2023 4:12 PM] Narration
The gun's eye would find Kaedues. Immediately, the gun would swing around towards Kaedues. Tracking him flawlessly! Its range of motion is 190 degrees.


[5/23/2023 4:18 PM] Kaedues Staub
*Kaedues recenters himself at the gun. He squats down slightly and places his hands on his knees....*
*Quickly now, Kaedues begins to make little dashes left and right! He swings his neck left but moves right! He preps a jump to the right but actually jumps left!* **"Uh!"** *He dives left but catches himself hard on his hands, redirecting his movement completely to the opposite direction!*

*He lands on his feet and rolls to the side before launching forward again into a brisk sprint! He finds a vacant section of the wall and scales around 5 feet of it before jumping towards his starting position.*


[5/23/2023 7:57 PM] Narration
The gun followed his lead. Of course with his sporadic movements it was not completely accurate falling short in specific cases such as sudden changes in his direction. The overall irregular movements of his limbs caused it to track imperfectly. Extending much further one way before doubling back to catch up. 

It tracks overall body movement, not just core velocity. Interesting! Despite this, the system captured the general pattern of his movements. It differentiated between an intentional stride and a jump to certain extents. Of course, these issues would be exacerbated at longer distances. When Kaedues landed, the gun was just a second behind as it settled in on his head.


[5/23/2023 7:58 PM] Danny Donovan
He would have gotten out of his chair and over towards the data pad. **"Where did you learn to do all of that?"**


[5/23/2023 8:00 PM] Kaedues Staub
*Kaedues landed on his feet in a squatting position. After a lone moment he climbs to his feet and dusts off his knees, then turning to Danny to respond.* **"It's better if I showed you rather than tell you. If you're really interested, we could work something out after work."** *Kaedues stretches forward....* **"Did you notice how the barrel did better towards the end? Am I seeing things?"**


[5/23/2023 8:01 PM] Kaedues Staub
**"I felt like I was doing better at evading it when I began..."** *He stares down the barrel of the gun....*


[5/23/2023 8:03 PM] Danny Donovan
**"That's because the central computer is learning; Reinforced learning. The faster it tracks, the more its rewarded."**


[5/23/2023 8:04 PM] Danny Donovan
He would disengage the targeting system.


[5/23/2023 8:04 PM] Narration
The gun would level off, deactivating its targeting.


[5/23/2023 8:08 PM] Kaedues Staub
**"...I'm sorry, did you say rewarded?"** *Kaedues raises an eyebrow at Danny.* **"What exactly do you reward a computer with?"** *He says as he walks forward towards Danny. He looks up at the man and smiles gently. Danny's presence by itself is enough to inspire some amount of optimism within Kaedues!*


[5/23/2023 8:38 PM] Danny Donovan
**"You reward the system with a score. Its only desire is to score the highest it possibly can. 1 is the highest score it can receive and 0 is the worst. It evaluates its score base on a bunch of factors. To name a few, target acquisition, target neutralization, gun speed to power draw ratios, and positive IDing."**


[5/23/2023 8:39 PM] Danny Donovan
**"A bad score will cause the computer to make drastic changes in areas that dropped it score. In this case, it made changes to its target acquisition the most."**


[5/23/2023 8:41 PM] Kaedues Staub
**"That... alright, that makes sense."** *Kaedues nods with a positive expression.* **"Thanks, Danny. What else needs testing?"** *Kaedues is straight to the point especially at work. He does like talking to Danny but work overrides everything else while the guy is on payroll. One thing after another, baby.*


[5/23/2023 8:43 PM] Danny Donovan
**"Got to test its rounds per minute. These things are notorious for slowing down when heating becomes an issue. So, I got some dud ammunition that would simulate the combustion of kinetic rounds."** He would walk way, when coming back he would return with a very large crate. Ammunition hanging out of the open lid.


[5/23/2023 8:46 PM] Kaedues Staub
**"Fair enough.... Where are you going to test that?"** *Kaedues asks bluntly.* **"And would dud rounds carry the same heat that normal rounds do?"**


[5/23/2023 8:48 PM] Danny Donovan
**"Testing it here. Of course I would give everyone else a head ups. The heat variables would be relatively 1:1. Made sure to order the __good__ stuff."**


[5/23/2023 8:49 PM] Kaedues Staub
**"If you say it's the best way,"** *Kaedues falls into line. He walks out of the way of the gun towards Danny now.* **"Ready when you are."**


[5/23/2023 8:56 PM] Danny Donovan
He would shout, warning everyone in the building. **"I'm testing the gun!"** He would start untangling the belt of ammunition then feeding it from the back of the weapon mechanism. The latches in the back would catch the first few rounds and begin pulling them through the weapon feed.


[5/23/2023 8:57 PM] Danny Donovan
Once the belt was properly positioned, he would walk towards the data pad. A few taps, he would wince as he lowered his finger for the confirmation.


[5/23/2023 8:58 PM] Kaedues Staub
*Kaedues crouches down and covers his ears, anticipating something very, very loud to begin to unfold!!*


[5/23/2023 9:01 PM] Narration
Once his finger came down, the rotary gun would spin. Shells and the plastic brackets holding the weapon steady as it feeds into the barrels fly out of the chamber.

[5/23/2023 9:03 PM] Narration
When we say the bullets and casings were flying everywhere. It was going everywhere. The empty casing would shower, no downpour onto the ground, some shooting out horizontally, hitting the walls, equipment, rebounding off of things and filling the floor with countless spent shells.


[5/23/2023 9:04 PM] Narration
The gun was almost pulling the crate containing the ammunition over. A testament to just how fast it would feed. The barrels starting to become a crimson red.


[5/23/2023 9:07 PM] Kaedues Staub
*Kaedues grabs the sides of his head as the sound of the colossal bullets resonate through the room. Several casings fly right at Kaedues, but he knows to take it in stride. He leans away from the gun eventually, outlining that discomfort.*


[5/23/2023 9:08 PM] Danny Donovan
After the first hundred or so rounds, he was chilling. Watching with a complacent expression. He was concerned with the metrics, even if hot shells and plastic casings hit him.\


[5/23/2023 9:11 PM] Kaedues Staub
*After enough shells hit Kaedues he begins to ease up as well. He stressed over the casings not knowing how much they hurt. It was kind of like being pinched a bunch of times, and Kaedues can handle that. He stands up slowly, still holding a hand in front of his head to shield his face.*


[5/23/2023 9:59 PM] Narration
After a minute, the gun would stop discharging the blanks. Spooling down until it idled. The barrels smoking from the intense heat. By now, they were so red that it rivaled Kaedues' hair.


[5/23/2023 10:01 PM] Danny Donovan
**"The calibrations I've done over the past few days paid off it seems. Seeing a small deviation from the marketed numbers but nothing critical."** He would return to the terminal, walking over the shells and plopping down into the chair to input more of the data.


[5/23/2023 10:50 PM] Kaedues Staub
*Kaedues' face relaxes as the rounds finally stop firing... He takes a breath before tailing behind Danny.* **"Is there anything else you need? You know I can go all day, man."** *Despite the fact that the room was louder moments ago than it had been in a long time, Kaedues is looking for something new to do. The man doesn't... calm down.*


[5/23/2023 11:23 PM] Danny Donovan
**"I got to compose some emails. So it will probably be a few hours before I do anything worth while. Thanks for your help Kaedues."**


[5/23/2023 11:23 PM] Danny Donovan
**"I'll worry about the mess later."**


[5/23/2023 11:26 PM] Kaedues Staub
*Happy with that answer, Kaedues decides to finally walk over to James. Since some time has passed hopefully he has cooled off.* **"Hey, James. Do you need help with anything?"** *He confidently asks James; This is another attempt to more visibly treat James as an equal. He wants to prove a point after all.*


[5/23/2023 11:31 PM] James Carter
He would glance over towards Kaedues for a moment before turning away. **"No, I don't need help. Never needed it."**


[5/23/2023 11:34 PM] Kaedues Staub
*Kaedues shrugs and returns to his normal line of work. You're welcome by the way. __Asshole__.*

[5/25/2023 6:35 PM] Narration
Kaedues returned to the shop the next day with no mishaps occurring! Such a relieving thing to come across. Well, if we do not account for the driveby Kaedues witnessed on the way back, we'll consider it a mishap free morning.

The door opened with Kaedues stepping inside. One key difference was that James as already in. His eyes flicking up towards Kaedues' direction. Once he realized who it was, he would go back to what he was doing. Looking at some schematics. Second, Grace did not greet Kaedues. She currently was putting new 3D nylon pieces together. Yesterday's prototypes weren't so successful.


[5/25/2023 6:51 PM] Kaedues Staub
*Kaedues walks into the room just like he did a few days ago. Standard routine here. The crimson-haired work mule approaches James casually and formally.* **"What needs to be done today?"** *He asks calmly. When James looked back at Kaedues he'd see a darkened red mark formed on the man's cheek. It still hurts, but Kaedues doesn't outwardly show it at the moment.*

*He seems pretty chill otherwise. It's just another day of work.*


[5/25/2023 6:55 PM] James Carter
**"Not today. Terrence put in a DOWOP and our task boards are empty. Grace is working on the weapon project and Danny is meeting with some executives in Fairview. We might leave early today."**


[5/25/2023 6:58 PM] Kaedues Staub
*Kaedues nods with his brow furrowed, clearly coming up with an idea.* **"If we do leave early, come see me outside. If you want to be treated to some food that is."** *Kaedues ends it with that, walking away towards Grace.*


[5/25/2023 7:00 PM] James Carter
He would grumble, going back to his schematics.


[5/25/2023 7:02 PM] Kaedues Staub
*Kaedues takes a moment to arrive next to Grace. When he gets there he takes a glance at what she's working on.* **"These look newer. What went wrong with yesterday's design?"**
*The words that leave Kaedues' mouth have a certain... permanence to them. They always do. Kaedues always means what he says, and at times it is relieving but at other times it can be intimidating. Kaedues is just as honest as he is capable.*


[5/25/2023 7:14 PM] Grace Dawson
She did not hear him approach. His voice startled Grace to her very core. Jumping a bit in her seat and the bending of a delicate piece she was working on. She gasped, both by Kaedues and the warping of thin nylon piece. She looked down at her now bent piece . **"...Everything."**


[5/25/2023 7:18 PM] Grace Dawson
This was followed by an exasperated sigh. Placing her head into her hands, clearly she has been stressed out. **"I just... got to think."**


[5/25/2023 7:23 PM] Kaedues Staub
*Kaedues crouches down a little, leveling himself with Grace. He rests his hands on his knees.*
**"Did you sleep enough last night? You are normally more attentive."** *Kaedues sounds concerned with Grace's productivity; He sounds concerned with her work.*


[5/25/2023 7:33 PM] Grace Dawson
Grace paused, raising her head out of her hands and looked at Kaedues. Partially confused and apprehensive. **"No... I haven't..."**


[5/25/2023 7:42 PM] Kaedues Staub
*Kaedues shrugs.* **"It happens, I understand. I can get a cup of coffee for you if it would help you work."** *He glances at the piece of nylon Grace messed up understanding he greatly contributed to that.* **"Sorry. __I really didn't mean to scare you. Honest.__"**


[5/25/2023 7:58 PM] Grace Dawson
She paused, looking into Kaedues' eyes.  **"N-No, I am fine. It's fine. I'll just, get over it."** Turning back towards her desk while shaking her head. Still frustrated.


[5/25/2023 8:02 PM] Kaedues Staub
*When she looks into his eyes, they lack a distinct quality she may have observed yesterday. During last night's time of reflection, Kaedues' honest eyes had a deeper look to them. Today they appear "flatter", much more obvious... but just as honest. __Just as honest__.* **"You sound upset. Are you sure the coffee wouldn't help at all?"**


[5/25/2023 8:17 PM] Grace Dawson
In the midst of her own emotions, she was drowning. There is no discernible difference between then and now in her mind regarding Kaedues' eyes. Not in her current state of mind. Grace was more concerned with coping with her feelings and recent failures. A tumble mix of internal conflict. 

She was regretting telling Kaedues her feelings. The moment the words left her mouth she immediately knew it was a mistake. She wanted to take it back, but it was too late. She was now stuck in an emotional limbo, unsure of what to do next. Rubbing her temple as a way to soothe the swelling migraine, **"I am sure."**


[5/25/2023 8:24 PM] Kaedues Staub
**"Alright. Let me know if you need anything."** *Kaedues says nothing else. He doesn't want to pry into the apprentice's business; It's not his place to ask. Kaedues begins making the rounds of Shop 1113 as he usually does. This involves cleaning and reorganizing as the weapon shop often gets cluttered when eyes are not kept on it.*


[5/25/2023 8:36 PM] Grace Dawson
When Kaedues left her alone she slowly shifted her eyes to the side where he once was. He was not very persistent, was he? His lack of desire to push for a resolution regarding the day before made her feel dejected and disappointed. She placed her head down on the table.
> "What am I doing with myself?"

*.......................................................*

*The seconds tick, one after another. Those seconds turn into minutes as well.*
*To Grace, it might feel like the world around her is __slowing down__. It might even feel like the natural ambience of it peters out and __muffles__. Do minutes pass, or do hours? Being lost in her own thoughts could easily have this effect.*

**"......ce......"** *Sounds filter in.* **"...race......... Grace."** *The ironically vibrant smell of black coffee violates Grace's nostrils, which were unprepared for it. Right in front of her stands a white coffee cup with a red paper band wrapped around the diameter of the cup at the midpoint.* **"You really meant it, it looks like."**

[5/25/2023 9:04 PM] Grace Dawson
She rose her head slowly. As she adjusted to the bright light, her gaze settled on the cup of coffee, the aroma wafting up her nostrils. She could almost taste the caffeine as the smell filled her senses, and she felt her energy beginning to return. But wait, that wasn't there before, she recalled telling Kaedues that she did not want any. Her eyes were heavy. Perhaps she cried silently and fell asleep. **"Oh, you shouldn't have— I don't deserve it."**


[5/25/2023 9:08 PM] Kaedues Staub
*He doesn't even take a moment to think about what she says. Kaedues has spoken with many people who talk ill of themselves.* **"You deserve it as much as I do,"** *He responds. Kaedues waits in front of Grace now, watching her like some sort of surveyor. This may even come off as uncomfortable to an extent.* **"and you clearly need the energy."**


[5/25/2023 9:18 PM] Grace Dawson
She considered his words. Though, despite not coming back to address the issue at hand. This did eradicate her impressions of him not caring. She would press her lips thin with a  hint of a grin. Taking the black coffee and drinking it without further protest.

[5/25/2023 9:27 PM] Kaedues Staub
**"So again, what went wrong with yesterday's model? Everything?"** *Kaedues leans forward over Grace, placing his hands reverse-grip on the shop apprentice's desk.* **"We're at a critical stage designing it after all. That kind of realization might happen again."**


[5/25/2023 9:31 PM] Kaedues Staub
*Kaedues is so complacent with continuing on, it's like there's nothing weighing him down. It's literally like any other day of the week to him. And how strange even is that? Yesterday, he returned to work like nothing was wrong after interrogating his own manager and having a fucking fistfight outside.*


[5/25/2023 9:42 PM] Grace Dawson
Having diverted her attention from what initially upset her. It was much more advantageous to get this information from her. Though, she sighed. Recalling the experience, **"The dye makers said the design was impossible with the current specs. The dye makers were concerned that the design would require too much press time to be mass produced. They also were concerned that the design would not be replicated precisely, resulting in inconsistencies in the finished product. Those are my words."** She pointed to the heap of metal of what could have been a gun. **"They threw it in my face and told me to get a real woman's job."**


[5/25/2023 9:43 PM] Grace Dawson
**"So, here I am today. Redoing it."**


[5/25/2023 9:49 PM] Kaedues Staub
**"There is Vespera for you. Lots of people think women are incapable. It's redundant to prove them wrong but you have to."** *Kaedues sounds very unhappy as these words escape his mouth. He actually stops looking at Grace as he continues to speak,* **"I mean come on, it's like they are outright refusing a ready and willing section of the city's work-force. If numbers are so important to them why don't they just shut the fuck up and let it happen?"** *He looks at Grace, that determined fire in his eyes ignited.* **"Let me see the old design."** *He barks out, clearly have been moved by what she said.*


[5/25/2023 10:01 PM] Grace Dawson
She had to stop and look at him for a moment. One question kept her up at night, guessing, yearning to know.
> "Who is Kaedues?"

She was frozen for a few moments before blinking and coming to. **"Yeah— sure."** She looked around, looking for blueprints of that particular design. Considering how long it took her to locate it, she considered it trash herself and wished to remove herself as much as possible from it. With it in her hands, she would place it flat on the desk.


[5/25/2023 10:14 PM] Kaedues Staub
*Kaedues personally picks up the old design of the gun and __personally__ inspects it. Kaedues leaves no inch, no centimeter unturned as he meticulously scans the entirety of the design. He tenderly seperates the model and takes an intimate look at the individual parts. With Kaedues' broad knowledge of work especially in this field he should be able to accurately judge if the things Grace said were true or not.*

*To summarize, Kaedues works hard to put into words why Grace is wrong just as a testament to his belief in her ability. Truthfully Kaedues sees a lot in the girl. Her ability to rebound from bad situations and create new ones in the workplace is a value that He greatly values.* **"......................"** *There is a grand silence in the air. If you listen closely enough you could even hear a quiet drumroll.*


[5/25/2023 10:16 PM] Grace Dawson
**"...?"** The anticipation is killing her.


[5/25/2023 10:20 PM] Kaedues Staub
*Kaedues gently sets the gun down and takes a breath in. Something strikes him in this moment.* **"James!"** *He calls out to James suddenly, likely interrupting whatever he is doing.* **"We have a problem."** *Kaedues stands up tall now and turns towards James while perfectly reassembling the gun model as if he had done it tens of times before. Hopefully James cares enough to give Kaedues the time of day.*


[5/25/2023 10:23 PM] James Carter
He would stand tall from his station, looking over towards Kaedues and Grace. **"Yeah, what?"**

*Kaedues underhand tosses Grace's gun model towards James for him to catch. It should be noted that even something as small as a toss looks fluid coming from Kaedues.* **"Take a look at this. A short one, a long one, either is fine."**

*After enough time passes by for James to make even __half__ of a quality inspection, Kaedues pipes up.* **"It's quality, isn't it? It's above functional. It is cost-effective, ergonomic, and deadly in the right hands."**


[5/25/2023 10:54 PM] James Carter
He caught it in the air with both hands. He scowls at the idea of helping Kaedues and Grace at first. Despite this, he knew if he just did it they'd leave him alone. He inspected it for a bit until Kaedues spoke. **"Yeah I guess. If I was a gunk looking for something small but could spray down an entire room of people I __hate__. I guess this would be okay."**

**"Right. They won't take this design. Look at it again, man."** *He pauses to allow James to take __even a passing glance__ at the weapon again.* **"They won't take it because __this woman__ made it. That design is compact. It is efficient, it is portable, it is easy to use and it is especially easy to learn. Listen to this: as the magazine empties, it makes a clicking noise that the user of the gun can internalize to know when the magazine is going to eject. There's also a safety mechanism for that too. Do you see where I'm going with this?"**

*He points at James.* **"I need your help,"** *declares Kaedues.* **"You __know__ this gun will run numbers. This gun __will__ outcompete any other variants of the MK Leopard other stores produce. The people up in corporate are willing to sacrifice all of that--because of their pride, and their ego. We need someone who is even slightly more in-tune with them, and that is where you come in."** *He pauses.* **"With your co-operation, we can make this design scale the ladder again and I __promise you__ it will make it."** *Kaedues looks at James with that signature flame in his eyes. Hearing Kaedues talk so passionately about something hopefully would evoke a response from James.*


[5/25/2023 11:12 PM] James Carter
He looked down at the weapon then rose an eyebrow towards Kaedues. To him, this sounded like an opportunity for __him__ to excel. **"You're __that__ confident in her design?"** He thought for a moment. **"Alright. I'll bite."**


[5/25/2023 11:17 PM] James Carter
**"I can get this in front of the execs. Danny is with them right now. I will shoot him a message so that he can chime in. Though, we will need to mill all the parts. We need the dye makers to do that. The dayshifter fuckers already know this design. So two options. We let the nightshifters do it, or we do it ourselves."**


[5/25/2023 11:23 PM] Kaedues Staub
**"......."** *Kaedues' eyes narrow for a moment as he is clearly thinking. You can even visualize the gears in his head turning.* **"I need to make a call."** *Kaedues abruptly walks away from Grace and James. He touches two fingers to the side of his head, shooting Gavyn a call. It's definitely a long shot, but Kaedues wants to explore all of the group's available options before pressing forward.*


[5/25/2023 11:25 PM] Gavyn
He answered after two rings.
> **"Hey Kaedues, what's up?"**


[5/25/2023 11:26 PM] Kaedues Staub
**"Hey Gav. I'm assuming you're busy but this is urgent. Do you know anyone with a working dye press that is just aching to be used? I'm in need of one that won't spout any rumors if you catch my drift."**


[5/25/2023 11:28 PM] Gavyn
**"Carlos."** He answered without missing a beat. **"He has one. Makes stuff for the warehouse from time to time."**


[5/25/2023 11:29 PM] Kaedues Staub
**"You mind if we come over in a bit then?"** *Kaedues __also__ answers without missing a beat. The conversation is paced like a gunfight-- each person firing off one after another without much time to miss.*


[5/25/2023 11:30 PM] Gavyn
> **"Sure, just enter through the side door. I'll leave it unlocked for you."**


[5/25/2023 11:35 PM] Kaedues Staub
**"Great."** *Kaedues hangs up and starts walking back towards James and Grace.*
**"Looks like we're leaving early after all you two. Grace, pack up blueprints and schematics-- anything you would need to use the dye press here."** *Kaedues scans the room skeptically before jogging over towards Danny's general setup. He looks extensively for military-grade material they could use to create the gun with.* **"James, when you send that message to Danny you might need to tell him to pick up some more gun metal on his way back."**


[5/25/2023 11:36 PM] Grace Dawson
She was still trying to figure out why this was happening. Well, there was no time for that! Get a move on girl. She stood up, reaching across the desk and moving around. Gathering all that she needed.


[5/25/2023 11:41 PM] James Carter
His eyes were already illuminated, sending his message to Danny. **"Uhuh..."**


[5/25/2023 11:43 PM] Kaedues Staub
*Kaedues opts to nab two 5x5 metal sheets from Danny's workshop. Sorry dude, we're in business now. Kaedues makes a beeline towards the door again, waving the two towards the exit. When he reaches the door he sets the sheets down and begins to perform the fastest shop lockup this world has ever seen. Lights, off. Windows? Blinded. The entire room looks in order within a minute--maybe two. Kaedues now waits at the exit to the shop for Grace and James to leave.*


[5/25/2023 11:45 PM] Grace Dawson
**"Where are we going?"** Still wearing her overalls, she hastily threw on her jacket. Holding the blueprints haphazardly as she walked out.


[5/25/2023 11:45 PM] James Carter
He carried nothing but himself. Lazily looking between Kaedues and Grace.


[5/25/2023 11:49 PM] Kaedues Staub
**"__Kapea.__"** *Kaedues replies before exiting the shop after them and locking the door.*


[5/25/2023 11:51 PM] James Carter
**"Oh, great. That is the last place I want to go. It's bad enough the shop is located in this dump of an area."** He'd complain.


[5/25/2023 11:51 PM] Grace Dawson
Grace did not have anything to say other than, **"I don't have a vehicle. Are we riding with you?"** She would ask Kaedues.


[5/25/2023 11:57 PM] Kaedues Staub
**"Damn right."** *With the metal sheets in hand, Kaedues jogs over to his work-provided van. This Mystery Machine lookalike piece of fucking junk.*

*He leaves the door open so that James and Grace can enter behind him. He hops into the driverside seat and opens up his armrest compartment where he would find a pack of unlabeled coconut flavored caffeinated gum. He unwraps the gum and throw the air, catching it between his teeth like he's done a hundred times before. Then he lets the gum fall into his mouth as he closes the armrest compartment. This is all routine.*

**"Man, fuck you."** He would retort.


[5/26/2023 12:18 AM] Grace Dawson
She was the first to enter, making her way towards the back to set her things down. Sitting down on the mattress.

He sat in the passenger seat.


[5/26/2023 12:20 AM] Kaedues Staub
**"You would __not__ be the first..."** *Kaedues mentions softly in response to James while he adjusts his rearview mirror, clearly not affected by the banter. He buckles up and takes a wide look behind him, glancing at Grace on the mattress before turning forward again and starting the car. They take off without a hitch.*

[5/26/2023 1:52 AM] Grace Dawson
With the gun pieces made and each piece being __manufactured__ to perfection. Grace sat at her desk with all the tools she needs and the pieces laid out. She got to work, immediately with immense focus.


[5/26/2023 1:55 AM] Kaedues Staub
*Kaedues doesn't dare interrupt the engineer at work. Her coffee, once piping hot is now ice cold at her desk.*
**"Thanks for coming along,"** *He says to James while she's busy.* **"It's refreshing to take a dive down every now and then."**


[5/26/2023 1:56 AM] James Carter
**"I only agreed because we would be making a name for ourselves. __If__ this goes well."**

**"Only a matter of time before Terrence get what's coming to him."**


[5/26/2023 2:00 AM] Kaedues Staub
*Kaedues shrugs, but is then caught off-guard by James' second comment.* **"......Ooh.... I understand. You want to get a corporate job, don't you? Our manager couldn't care less about __anything__ though so he'd never put in a word about you...."**

*Kaedues pauses.* **"There has to be a way to get to him somehow. Sooner that than getting a new manager, anyway."**


[5/26/2023 2:05 AM] James Carter
He said dryly **"Sooner I go corpo, the better off I'll be. This weapon is our key for all of us to get something better. He gets no credit, we get it all. He gets fired and we move up. Simple as that."**


[5/26/2023 2:06 AM] Grace Dawson
It did not seem like she was listening, but she indeed was. Every once and a while she'll look in their direction from the corner of her eye.


[5/26/2023 2:08 AM] Kaedues Staub
**"By the way...."**
*Kaedues opens up casually, leaning backwards on the wall while maintaining eye contact with James.* **__"What'd you do to him?"__**


[5/26/2023 2:08 AM] James Carter
He'd smirk, **"What's that suppose to mean?"**

*Cutting him off.* **"Saw the security tapes."** *Is all he says.*

**"You got that right."** He went back to viewing Grace's progress.

**"Done."** She slid the weapon towards the edge of the table.


[5/26/2023 2:16 AM] Kaedues Staub
*Kaedues turns towards Grace and picks up the weapon. No longer a prototype, this weapon reached the very end of the design process-- a testament to just how genius of a design it is. The MK-25 Leopard. He holds it up, inspecting it carefully.....*

**"....Take a look at that~"**


[5/26/2023 2:20 AM] James Carter
**"We done? Can I go home now?"**


[5/26/2023 2:23 AM] Kaedues Staub
**"Sorry about that, my liege. I forgot that your loyalties lie only with your computer screen and your right hand."** *He tilts his head sarcastically before pushing the gun towards James; Not pointing it at him. It is positioned sideways.* **"Would you just look again? You're in on it, not an audience."**


[5/26/2023 2:25 AM] James Carter
**"Hahaha.... As the research and development acting supervisor. I will approve of this."** He would twirl it around a few times before handing it back to Grace. **"Danny messaged back, got us a seat with some mid level execs. All I got out of that was micros are involved."**

*He turns to Grace.* **"What are your opinions on all this? You're the one that designed the gun after all."**


[5/26/2023 2:29 AM] Grace Dawson
**"I mean... Yeah— This is fine."** She did not seem to have much of a solid opinion. Going with the flow for the most part.


[5/26/2023 2:37 AM] Kaedues Staub
*Kaedues chuckles. Such an underplayed response despite how crucial she was to any of this happening. After all, she was the one to bring up the problems with the old design. Kaedues recalls when they spoke about the shortcomings of that old prototype and how to fix them. It feels climactic to have held the new, finished product in his hands.*

**"Well, that just about wraps today up yeah. Time to head home, as long as there isn't anything else to do."** *Kaedues cracks his knuckles before stretching his arms.*


[5/26/2023 2:39 AM] James Carter
**"That means I am out. I don't have to tell either you to be on time so. Tomorrow it is."** He'd head on out.


[5/26/2023 2:43 AM] Kaedues Staub
*Kaedues makes one last glance at Grace before heading to the door himself. He had a smile on his face, happy with today's work. That's not something you see often, either.*
*Despite everything that happened today Kaedues moves around like he just got out of bed. He has the never-depleting energy of a teenager.*


[5/26/2023 3:00 AM] Grace Dawson
She was unwilling to leave. Instead, she watched Kaedues leave. What a rollercoaster ride of emotions. Despite the coffee he graciously gave her. Exhausted, both physically and emotionally, she felt her eyes grow heavy with fatigue as she watched Kaedues leave, a rollercoaster of emotions that left her emotionally drained. Kaedues had been so selfless when he entered that day, offering her a cup of coffee and persistent about ensuring her well-being. Despite this, Kaedues does what he does best. There was still that ebbing question on her mind. 

> "Who is Kaedues?"

He was someone like no other. In a city so cruel, so hell-bent on destroying itself. She found herself in Shop 1113 by chance. Being blessed to have someone like Kaedues and what he has done for her today. Confirming her talent, showing her confidence. This was no longer an assumption for her. She felt loved. But not in the way others associate love. She mattered, everything she did mattered to this man and he made sure she was a part of his schedule. Kaedues was a light in her dark world. His simple actions and words made her feel heard. This was the feeling she was scared of, the feeling of being wrong. But that was no longer the case.

She smiled, blushing furiously as she thought about him. It had no effect on her whether the feeling was one directional. As long as this continues, she needs nothing more.

*Kaedues exits the shop like any other day. On his way out, he notices the lead pipe that sparked yesterday's chaotic chain of events. He stops in place and turns his head to pay it his attention... and when he does, he starts to recall all of that.*

*He recalls how he felt at the time. In retrospect, he didn't feel at all like himself when he walked in. Like he was watching himself make these bold plays and loud calls. He remembers punching out James and asking for it in return.*
*__.....Is that everything?__ Kaedues asks himself. Immediately, he is awarded an answer. Of course it's everything. The rest of the day went smoothly and then he went home.*

*.....Just like now. He shakes his head and keeps walking over to his car. He'd likely take another odd job on the way home too.*

[5/29/2023 10:29 PM] Narration
The next few days proceeded smoothly in Shop 1113. With the project now concluded, the entire team was dedicated to the odd jobs that came in through the rest of the shop. Testing and researching micro-projects that would be completed in mere hours. 

Danny returned to the shop the next day. Happy as ever, as if nothing had changed. Discovering that he was the top engineer in D9 really provided some insight on his role in the overall company to the team. Grace's work has diversified since MK-25 submission. Her movements around the shop became more varied, and she was no longer able to remain confined to her workstation. It was a worthwhile change, one that pulled her out of her comfort zone. 

As a result of the meeting at the BioTek office, James became more focused on the tasks before him. Repurposing his attitude to something more productive. Kaedues and he have not fought, not even once. He has been more willing to take on challenges, and has found himself able to stay focused on the task at hand. His newfound attitude has enabled him to finish his work quicker and with greater accuracy. He had always had a nack for what he do, but with a change of attitude, it really does make it shine.


[5/29/2023 10:33 PM] Kaedues Staub
*Kaedues is cleaning up as usual. He thinks of today no differently than any other day, another day out. A lot of people might, at this point, question why the work. Not Kaedues-- he's too busy working. Kaedues is quiet, like usual. Able to blend in and out from the scenery almost. Kaedues is what you might want out of a worker, never questioning too much his position. Just.... Working.*


[5/29/2023 10:42 PM] Narration
James was not in the building yet and either was Terrence. Speaking of Terrence, he consistently has been on DOWOP since the first time about two weeks ago.


[5/29/2023 10:51 PM] Grace Dawson
Grace was at the table in the center of the shop. Navigating through the data pad menus. Her emerald eyes danced across the interface as she absorbed the data scrolling across the UI. Grace would take a moment to pause in her research, taking __at least__ a few seconds to admire Kaedues. 

There has been a lingering question on her mind for some time now. Unsure of how to ask and when is the best time to do so. After work was certainly the most convenient time but lately, she had found no time to muster up the courage to ask. It is not a good idea to do this during work hours. James and Danny had to be in ear shot and drawing attention was not in her play book.

These thoughts were interrupted by—


[5/29/2023 10:54 PM] James Carter
James would enter into the shop, carrying his work bag on his shoulder as usual. Though, he had a shit eating grin as he walked over to the punch card terminal. Hmm. Wonder what that is all about.


[5/29/2023 10:56 PM] Kaedues Staub
*Kaedues keeps working. At this point, the office is definitely clean enough. Kaedues keeps his hands busy for good looks, since there is not much to do. He'd work on whatever he was assigned, though.*

*After a second he stands up and ruffles his hair around just to get the blood flowing. Then, it's back to scrubbing the floors... Wiping off the machinery.*


[5/29/2023 10:59 PM] Grace Dawson
Grace's gaze followed James all the way to the terminal. Curious on what got him in such a good mood.


[5/29/2023 10:59 PM] James Carter
Once he punches in, he would turn to see Grace looking towards him. **"...What?"** Despite getting along with Kaedues, the same could not be said with Grace.


[5/29/2023 11:00 PM] Grace Dawson
She furrowed her brow, looking away from him. That was a mistake. **"Nothing, sorry."**


[5/29/2023 11:01 PM] James Carter
**"Good. If you need me, I will be throwing Terrence's shit away."** With little to no room for questioning he would dip into Terrence's office.


[5/29/2023 11:04 PM] Kaedues Staub
*Kaedues gives a thumbs up from the corner of the room. Good job, James. Or lack thereof.*
*Kaedues could only hope that James might do something Terrence wouldn't... But he doesn't do that. Not yet anyway.*

*Once the area is clean enough to where Kaedues looks like he is wasting time, he gets up and walks over to Grace. Covered in dust and even a little bit of old oil.* **"Is there anything you want help with today?"** *He asks casually, hoisting his rag over a shoulder.*


[5/29/2023 11:15 PM] Grace Dawson
She was not quite finished with her thought of Kaedues. In fact, his sudden appearance caused her to blurt out something that she was running through her mind currently. Raising her eyes to meet his she would say **"I wanted to ask if—"** 

Quickly realizing her slip, she stammered, trying to recover. She glanced down at her hands, her digits twitching with her unease, and back up to meet Kaedues's gaze. **"I meant to ask...uh..."** She scrambled for something, anything that would be a plausible cover.

Suddenly, her eyes lit up as she spotted a half-magazine on the workbench nearby. **"I meant to ask if you've seen the spring tool for this magazine model,"** she said, forcing a laugh, though it came out more like a nervous giggle. 

**"The thing's as elusive as a ghost in the machine, right?"**
Her smile was tight, her face still a bit flushed, but she hoped that her quick thinking would at least give her a moment's reprieve from the embarrassing situation.


[5/29/2023 11:19 PM] Kaedues Staub
*Kaedues watches in awe as she actually tries to salvage that. Kaedues nods slowly and surely.* **"I haven't, but I know where they are."** *Kaedues extends a hand out for the magazine in question, not missing a beat.*


[5/29/2023 11:31 PM] Grace Dawson
Grateful for the reprieve, Grace's eyes gleamed with a mixture of relief and gratitude. As Kaedues extended his hand, she quickly passed the magazine over to him *(Faster than he could grab it, whaaaat?)*, appreciating the smooth transition he had allowed.

**"I was struggling with it for a good minute."** She admitted, trying to keep her tone light and casual despite the earlier hiccup. **"You've got impeccable timing, Kaedues. It's like you have a sixth sense for when I'm in over my head."**

She paused, shooting him a small, somewhat sheepish smile as she leaned back against the workbench, doing her best to recover her composure. It wasn't every day that she fumbled her words so badly. Wait—


[5/29/2023 11:33 PM] Kaedues Staub
*Kaedues shifts his balance now, holding the magazine loosely between his fingers. He looks down at Grace with both eyebrows raised. Is he confused? Is he appalled? IS HE--*

[5/29/2023 11:37 PM] Kaedues Staub
*No he's just taken aback a little. He looks at the spring inside the magazine. Just trying to gauge how bad of a condition the spring is in, that is all. What does he see when he looks inside the magazine you ask?*
*It's fine. The spring is fine. Kaedues furrows his brow before blowing gently on the spring and handing it back to Grace.* **"Meet me after work."** *Without allowing her to respond, he walks away and over towards Danny now.*


[5/29/2023 11:39 PM] Grace Dawson
She continued to play into it as she took the magazine from him. Still smiling, **"Ye— yeah, of course."** 
> "ᶠᵘᶜᵏ"


[5/29/2023 11:42 PM] Kaedues Staub
*Kaedues walks across the shop. He looks around on his way there at all of the machinery he is so familiar with, reminiscing back when he first joined. Danny is the only one from that group that is still here... It makes Kaedues feel nostalgic.*

**"...Hey, Danny. Mind if I pull your ear for a second?"**


[5/29/2023 11:46 PM] Danny Donovan
He was working on a cybernetic hand on a table. Let's just say that it was a huge work in progress as all its internals were half hanging out and in disarray. Several long hydraulic arms hang from the ceiling with a large array of tools attached to them. He had a welding mask on. He would raise the shield and look over towards Kaedues. One of the arms that was soldering a ram bank on the motherboard would remove itself from the board and go up with the rest of them.

**"Hey Kaedues, what's up.?"**


[5/29/2023 11:50 PM] Kaedues Staub
*Kaedues looks over at what Danny is working on but only for a moment. He'd get back to that later. His eyes drift up to Dan, and he pauses. Kaedues is clearly __not hesitating__. Rather he is thinking. Thinking of his time spent here. And of course, thinking of his time up in D9 offices with Danny those days ago.*

**. . .**

**"Thanks."**

*Kaedues says with a subtle nod. Danny has known Kaedues for long enough to understand that there's a lot more behind that.*
*Kaedues says thanks for everything. Thanks for helping him learn all this time. And especially thanks for the good word.*


[5/29/2023 11:55 PM] Danny Donovan
**"Oh"** He would chuckle, turning his chair to face Kaedues a bit more. He understood the gesture. **"No problem, Kaedues. If there is anything I can do for you, let me know."**


[5/29/2023 11:59 PM] Kaedues Staub
**"Will do. Is there anything I can help you with today?"** *He asks just like he would any other day. Of course, Kaedues REALLY came over here to work more. Work more!!!*
*Some part of Kaedues enjoys being capable as well. To be able to ask the question, 'Can I help you'? and really mean, 'What do you need done'. It's satisfying. Kaedues knows his power and is happy to use it for work.*


[5/30/2023 12:00 AM] Danny Donovan
He would go to explain, **"Not today kid. Everything I need is already laid out and ready to go. Waiting for the magic to reveal itself."**


[5/30/2023 12:02 AM] Kaedues Staub
*Kaedues nods. He looks even a little defeated.... He wants to do more. It is on occasions like this you might see Kaedues become antsy or even a tad annoying with all the questions he could be asking. But he's fine for now.*

*With that, he gets back to cleaning. He wants to ask James a few questions but he can save them for tomorrow when he's all situated.*

[12/9/2024 5:41 AM] Danny Donovan
Danny pulled up into the employee parking lot of Shop 1113. Not much has changed aside from the absence of Kaedues' van that generally was parked in that particular spot near the adjacent wall. Instead of parking in a designated spot. Danny parked in front of the doors. A move that signifies that he wasn't planning on staying long. 

**"...And we are here."**

There has not been much dialogue between the two co-workers. Danny exited his vehicle briskly with little to nothing to say. Once he cleared the ceiling of his vehicle, he looked around weary before making is way inside the facility.


[12/9/2024 1:15 PM] Kaedues Staub
*Kaedues himself hadn't tried to create dialogue either. He looks at the floor, distant, a little preoccupied. He gets up and walks into the facility all the same though-- the layout is familiar enough for him to enter without needing to look around.*

*Once he does enter, the familiar sterile smell of the air combined with any lingering dust or stale exhaust pulls him from his sleeping head. He looks around for anything of interest; In particular, he wants to verify the location of a cybernetic he believes he saw earlier, and to inspect Grace's work station.*

[12/9/2024 2:57 PM] James Carter
Front and center of the room stood James, sweeping in the quiet shop floor. It wasn't until Danny and Kaedues entered that he gazed up from his menial task.

**"Oh, there you two are!"** He exclaimed, looking relieved to see them. **"This lockdown bullshit has been fucking everything up."**


[12/9/2024 2:57 PM] Danny Donovan
Not in the mood for a conversation with him, Danny just walked past him without words.


[12/9/2024 2:57 PM] Narration
But that didn't sway James one bit.


[12/9/2024 2:57 PM] James Carter
**"Management has been on my ass for the last few days. Talking about numbers aren't being met. They aren't the ones dealing with a lockdown, ya know? It's a good thing you both are back, since you're the most productive ones."**

He seemed a little too happy to see them...


[12/9/2024 3:05 PM] Kaedues Staub
*Kaedues approaches Grace's working area. He takes a look at the no doubt cluttered desk space, and when he raises his hand to begin sifting through he finds himself to hesitate. This is an invasion of privacy..*

*(There has to be one here. I can't imagine she found the time to throw it away.)*

*But he looks through anyway. Kaedues is in particular looking for a copy of the schematic for the MK-25 Leopard, but will check out any other items of interest if there are any..*


[12/9/2024 3:20 PM] Narration
On the surface of Grace's desk held a treasure trove of items. Digital notes illuminating data pads that were left on their chargers.

Components for weapons, attachments, and tubing. Too many pencils and pens scattered throughout the space.

Rulers and laser pointers, dry erase markers, tape.

A Chip drive left isolated on the mount of her monitor. Could have data on it. There were drawings involving the gatlin gun that Danny was prototyping days prior. Who would've known Grace had a hand in that project. In fact, there were **ALOT** of prototypes, final builds, and rough drafts. Quite impressive?

But no MK on the desk... Perhaps in her schematics drawer that was behind him?


[12/9/2024 3:28 PM] Kaedues Staub
*Kaedues exhales with a tinge of guilt. He takes the chip drive and pockets it first thing. His eyes glide over to the gatling gun drawings, and while he lingers his gaze Kaedues makes a mental note of her involvement in the project.*

**"You.."**

*He turns around and takes a look at Grace's schematics drawer. If there's anything that points to a recent date, he would check first, but if not then he'd just be pulling out drawers starting from the top and making his way down.*


[12/9/2024 4:24 PM] Narration
There was no sorting indicated on the doors of the drawers. However it would seem that the work he was looking for was right on top on the top drawer.


[12/9/2024 4:29 PM] James Carter
**"Are you guys even listening?"** He'd ask. Clearly displeased with getting ignored!


[12/9/2024 7:08 PM] Kaedues Staub
*The paper in his hands feels somehow more significant than it used to. Kaedues folds the blueprint a few times and stuffs the thing in his pocket. He turns back to Grace's desk...*

**"..Right,"** *He says and turns away. He approaches Danny, however the man is making use of his time--*
**"How long, Danny?"**


[12/9/2024 7:17 PM] Danny Donovan
Danny was in the process of unhooking some cables from his chair. On the cushion of the chair was a large crate filled with devices and tools which Kaedues could and would be familiar with him using quite freqently. In addition, sitting on top was a plastic see-through case of potentially hundreds of shards layered in sleeves. This wasn't something that was seen before if Kaedues could recollect his collection and the valuation of the container would make anyone's mouth froth from how rich they could be with such a large deck... Danny glanced over towards Kaedues when he heard his name and the question that was asked. It confused him, so he did what any person who wishes for context would ask...

**"What do you mean how long? How long until I am done packing my things?"** He inquired as he stood up straight.


[12/9/2024 7:25 PM] Kaedues Staub
*Kaedues finds himself looking at the box with all the shards inside as he responds.* **"No, not that. I meant to ask how long you're staying in Haven Heights for."**

*(They're all in sleeves. I don't know anyone who has the budget to buy sleeves for their cybernetics..)*

*He crosses his arms, or tries to-- where he would normally grip his right forearm with his left hand.. well. His arms slip apart, and it rouses a disapproving sigh from Kaedues.*


[12/9/2024 7:32 PM] Danny Donovan
He moved towards his crate and moved it from the chair to one of his many desks. **"Not long enough for me to run into Grace's father. Once I gather what I need from here, I am going home and handling my situation. Need to speak with my employer in corporate. They can help me figure out a way to... Get out of this situation."**


[12/9/2024 7:54 PM] Kaedues Staub
*Kaedues holds his hand over his stomach. His left hand.. it hurts. He has a hard time processing what Danny just said, it looks like.*

*He steps over a few stray wires around Danny's chair and crouches down in front of a tube-shaped tank protruding from the wall. He looks at his reflection. Actually, it would be apt to say he stares at his reflection.*

*(...What do I do?)*
*He asks himself. He peers into the eyes of that warped reflection. If it could answer, would its voice be as warped as its body?*

*(Am I going to follow Danny? ...Why? I haven't known him that long. The place where I feel attachment to the guy.. feels like thinking about.. nothing. Where did the feeling come from?)*

*(And..)* *Kaedues stands up and looks back towards Grace's desk.* *(She told me something. No.. was it me? Did I say it? Why does trying to piece this together feel like sifting salt out of water?)*

[12/9/2024 7:58 PM] Kaedues Staub
*With a deep breath in, and then out, Kaedues looks to Danny.* **"Dan, would you mind driving me back to my place?"**


[12/9/2024 8:01 PM] Danny Donovan
**"I suppose I could do that. Give me 10 minutes and we can head out."**


[12/9/2024 8:05 PM] Kaedues Staub
*He nods. Kaedues pats his pants down, paces to the doorway, and leans up against the wall. He keeps looking down the room at Grace's workspace.*


[12/9/2024 8:11 PM] James Carter
**"Are you both quitting or something?"** James asked incredulously, the biggest indicator was not the fact Danny was packing but rather Kaedues not asking for **__something to do.__**


[12/9/2024 8:14 PM] Danny Donovan
Walking past James, Danny would speak, **"James, in the nicest way possible..."** Danny then turned his head towards him. **"Shut the fuck up."** With that, Danny set one of his crates on the table in the center of the shop. **"Got a problem with me leaving? Take it up with your management."**


[12/9/2024 8:17 PM] James Carter
**"A— ......."** https://tenor.com/view/kirill-speechless-gif-9980969 He just stepped aside and went back to the office.

With that, Danny began moving his stuff to his car.


[12/9/2024 8:32 PM] Kaedues Staub
*Kaedues takes it upon himself to help Danny out. With a silence, he picks one crate up and stacks it on top of an adjacent one. With a silent grunt, Kaedues crouches down and lifts the crates from beneath. He follows behind Dan and would help him unload the crates to his car.*


[12/9/2024 8:56 PM] Danny Donovan
Once outside, Danny made his way to his vehicle and came to a stop just before reaching the trunk. His eyes dancing around as if something was wrong. **"..."** But after a moment nothing occuring, he opened his trunk and sat the crate into the back.


[12/9/2024 9:02 PM] Kaedues Staub
*Kaedues takes note of it. He follows suit and sets the crates he brought next to Danny's.* **"Hey,"** *He says after a short silence. The boxes being in line makes him feel comfortable about it.*

[12/9/2024 9:06 PM] Kaedues Staub
*Kaedues' voice trails off. He moves to the passenger side. Before Kaedues opens the door, he takes a look at the entrance to the shop-- a brief look. He opens the door and seats himself passenger-side.*


[12/9/2024 9:14 PM] Danny Donovan
He wasted no time starting his vehicle and pulling out of the parking lot. He was not going to sit around and find out the hard way...


[12/9/2024 9:16 PM] Kaedues Staub
*Kaedues keeps to himself on the ride to his place. He reaches around his neck, feeling the flash drive hanging at the end of his necklace.*

[1/22/2025 11:15 PM] Narration
Kaedues pulled up towards Shop 1113, in the parking lot where he always parks in. Danny's vehicle is obviously vacant. Given that he up and left, for good reason too. There were other vehicles that were never present here that are parked.


[1/22/2025 11:17 PM] Kaedues Staub
*Kaedues exits his van and locks it before walking up to the automatic door he has grown used to entering the place from.*


[1/22/2025 11:19 PM] Narration
Bee-deep! His credentials still worked! The doors to the shop opened right up, and beyond the compression room glass that led to the rest of the shop, Kaedues could see people working there. More people were present than when he left. If he counted, 8 to 9 individuals working on all sorts of things.


[1/22/2025 11:23 PM] Kaedues Staub
*Kaedues's eyes scan the entire room briefly, but finding James isn't too difficult. He walks through the shop, minding the tubing on the floor and evading any passers-by as he approaches.*

**"You asked for me."** *..is how he introduces himself, whether or not James saw the guy coming or not.*


[1/22/2025 11:26 PM] James Carter
He turned around to come face to face with Kaedues. He was wearing a worker's apron and had a broom in his hand. **"I did not expect you to actually fuckin' show up."** He sounded surprised, his eyebrows turned upwards.


[1/22/2025 11:27 PM] Kaedues Staub
*Kaedues pockets his hands and gives James a neutral expression. He says nothing, just waiting for the guy to inevitably start talking.*


[1/22/2025 11:35 PM] James Carter
He'd sigh. **"Grace's shit was being trashed."** He'd point towards the corner of the room which had a heap of her things. **"Held it as long as I could. Today unfortuantely is the last day it can stay before my manager is going to take a blow torch to it."**


[1/22/2025 11:39 PM] Kaedues Staub
**"..You held out and kept the stuff?"** *Kaedues asks rhetorically.* **"I can take it. Now that I have the trunk space, I could probably take the entire setup off your hands,"** *Kaedues says.* **"Give me a minute and I'll have it all sorted out."**

*With that, Kaedues navigates to the cluster of items in the corner. He didn't think James would actually hold out on keeping this stuff around. Then again, doing nothing is the easiest way to go about it..*


[1/22/2025 11:39 PM] James Carter
**"Yeah, whatever."** He'd start sweeping.

[1/24/2025 5:07 PM] Kaedues Staub
*Looking at the pile of Grace's belongings, it's difficult do discern what is garbage and what is salvage-- especially since Kaedues never was the type to look through her things.*
*(If I were in her position, what would I want to protect? ...Anything that was a commitment to money, or time, for sure.)*

*Kaedues makes an effort to retrieve the data pads that had her notes, and any drawings or schematics that he can find. The data pads ought to be worth keeping based on price alone, and the schematics likely took much time to make.*


[1/24/2025 5:19 PM] Narration
During Kaedues's scavenging session, he procured many items that could be considered valuable.
x 3 datapads seemed to be dead or powered off which would make sense.
x 15 schematics, rough drafts that weren't simply sketched. Valuable to her, most likely.
x 2 thick books that had many of her own notes in them.
x 1 one complete rifle, however, the components were not assembled. The lower assembly had a lock-out tag with secure encryption on it. Interesting!


[1/24/2025 5:38 PM] Kaedues Staub
*Kaedues takes a good look at the valuable items and thinks about how to take them all back to the van at once. Mama did __not__ raise a two-trip bitch.*

*..Or maybe she did. Kaedues notes the weapon components and figures it would be a better idea to take the valuables to the van first.*

*First, Kaedues stuffs the schematics under one arm. He clamps his upper arm to his side __tightly__ so that they would not move even if disturbed. Then, the red-haired gofer lifts the loose books onto his mechanical hand. The data pads are tucked underneath his other arm, and held up with his right hand.*

*He takes a special degree of care when moving back towards the door he came in from. These components are valuable-- if any worker were to move in his direction, he'd just let them pass...*


[1/24/2025 6:00 PM] Narration
Everyone was hard at work around Kaedues. The atmosphere was chaotic overall, completely contrasting from what it was before. Three individuals were over by Grace's old desk, discussing plans regarding some unknown project that came down the chain. Other than that, Kaedues went about undisturbed.


[1/24/2025 6:23 PM] Kaedues Staub
*Not part of Kaedues' current directive, as interesting as the project could be. He sets the books down, fetches the van's keys from his back pocket, and makes short work of stashing the items in the passenger seat. With that underway..*

*Kaedues returns to the heap of junk. He saw quite a few rifle parts but hadn't quite figured out if they would actually make anything at the time. Now, Kaedues begins to fish for and recover all of the strewn-about weapon parts. Considering the lower assembly is already built, it really only left the barrel, the heel, and the scope attachment-- and the magazine, of course.*

*All in all, it looks.. good. Kaedues kneels down and gets a good look at the rifle itself, just to make sure it's all there.*
*(I never even realized that she had this at her desk. Someone like Grace would be able to assemble this just as fast as I did, if not faster, and the lock out on the lower assembly makes this thing a chore to pawn off anywhere. She must have some understanding of the position Freddy is in, then.)*

*He furrows his brow.*
*(What is that old man doing now, anyway?)*

[1/24/2025 6:23 PM] Kaedues Staub
*Well, he's not gonna just walk out of the shop with an assembled gun. He quickly takes the components apart (except the lower assembly, of course) and looks around. Are there any cardboard boxes nearby he could place these things in?*


[1/24/2025 6:32 PM] Narration
Luckily for him, one of the new employees had just set down a box that was just used moments ago, set right next to the compactor they used to get rid of materials.


[1/24/2025 6:39 PM] Kaedues Staub
*Kaedues moves toward the box in a few strides. He places the gun components in the box, then folds the lid shut. Lucky for him, it was just used so the tape is still adhesive and can seal the gap. He stands up with the box tucked under his arm, and moves back towards the heap of Grace's belongings to look one more time for anything of interest.*


[1/24/2025 6:44 PM] Narration
There were no more items of interest!


[1/24/2025 6:55 PM] Kaedues Staub
*In that case, Kaedues makes with the box toward the exit. On his way out, he makes an effort to pass by James. His contact information is forwarded to the guy without a word uttered.*

*The trip to the van is another uneventful one, and this time Kaedues climbs into the loading bay. He places the box behind the passenger seat, nestled into a corner.*


[1/24/2025 7:24 PM] Narration
As Kaedues nestled the box into the corner, he could hear the faint sound of a heavy engine grumbling and roaring down a nearby street. It was increasing in intensity. As time began to tick by, the sound manifested into more than sound, but physical; Vibrations began to rattle the interior of the van, granted not enough to throw Kaedues off balance. 

Something was approaching or passing by.


[1/24/2025 7:28 PM] Kaedues Staub
*Kaedues short-hops off the lip of the loading bay and closes the doors. He walks around the van toward the driver-side door, and looks toward where the sound is coming from.*

*(...What?)*


[1/24/2025 7:40 PM] Narration
It was a tracked vehicle like tank. On its flank were troops that Kaedues had never seen before. These were CCR agents, no. From his experience, they were far more advanced, organized, and structured to be CCR agents. But wait, was it vaguely familiar? Perhaps. What was maybe important was who these guys were. It was about a dozen of them, their behavior suggested they were patrolling. Thankfully, they were certainly rolling past the parking lot Kaedues found himself in.

[1/24/2025 7:49 PM] Kaedues Staub឵
*Kaedues closes his eyes and furrows his brow. He fetches a piece of coconut gum from its packaging and tosses it into his mouth. He lets out an exhasperated sigh while he chews.*

**"This is gonna be real bad for the economy.."** *He says as he opens the driver side door and slots the keys into the ignition. With a single turn, the van hums to life. It feels normal to him now.*


[1/24/2025 8:09 PM] Kaedues Staub឵
*Kaedues looks down. He feels a disturbance in his stomach, and realizes he hasn't eaten **__anything__** since the noodles from Fairview. He feels a little peckish, so he might as well go somewhere before the gig Gavyn offered up. He does have money to spend, but Kaedues isn't the type to splurge on a fancy dining experience.*

*He pushes the van into drive and steers it forward. He's got a particular spot in mind already-- a gyro joint. Even though he doesn't want anything extravagant, anything that uses fresh ingredients is definitely a treat option for Kaedues.*
*It's only a couple turns and straight shots to the shop, and he pulls into a parking lot in around 15 minutes. Kaedues has never been to this particular shop before-- he has overheard passing stories from within Shop 1113, but is pretty fresh to the area all things considered.*


[1/24/2025 8:34 PM] Narration
As Kaedues pulled into the parking lot, he was graced with a line that seeped out on the sidewalk along the front of the building. They were indeed popular.


[1/24/2025 8:37 PM] Kaedues Staub
*Kaedues rolls up the windows. He exits the van, locks it, and takes a look at the line. This.. well, to be frank it irks Kaedues.*
*(..It is that time of day. Can't blame the joint for being so packed.)*

*Begrudgingly, he walks to the end of the line.*

**"Who would've guess that Haven Heights would finally get proper law enforcement?"** A man in front of would inquiry. Clearly engaged in a civil conversation with someone in front of him.

**"By proper law enforcement, you mean enforcing ridiculous curfews that involve mowing down dozens? I know the CCR was harsh whenever they did something, but these guys are something else."**

**"I heard there was a prison break in Fairview. Must be retaliation."**

**"Then they should use that decking energy on Fairview. It's a bit late to give a damn about this shit-hole."**

These people were certainly yappers. But it was this yapping that could pass the time as the line continued to move quite efficiently.. It was...very efficient in fact.


[1/24/2025 8:54 PM] Kaedues Staub
*Curfew... As Kaedues hears the word, he rolls his tongue in his mouth. That's a bad taste. That is a very bad taste.*
*He walks in step with the rest of the people in lane.*

*(This sounds like something I would actually have seen in Fairview. I would think Danny knows a thing or two about how to avoid surveillance, but.. he won't answer when I ring him.)*

*Kaedues' eyes open a little wider.*
-# *`"Oh and newsflash, chrome dome, you're just another cog in this broken mac-"`*
-#                        *`"I.. I'm sorry. I didn't meant that. Forget I said anything."`*

*(Maybe she'd know, come to think of it. I don't have the patience to call her right now though. Maybe tomorrow..)*

Soon, Kaedues was inside the place. All the seats inside were occupied, and there were people standing at the entire width of the counter, making requests left and right. A few instances had Kaedues almost bumped into as customers made their way out of the establishment with their meals or satisfied bellies.


[1/24/2025 9:01 PM] Kaedues Staub
*Kaedues' eyes stay focused forward, unchanging; completely fixated on the arbitrary task of buying a meal. His attention doesn't wander in the mean time.*


[1/24/2025 9:12 PM] Narration
Finally, it was Kaedues' turn to order. The employee beyond the counter was curt and to the point, **"Pick-up, ordering, or sitting in?"**


[1/24/2025 9:14 PM] Kaedues Staub
**"Ordering,"** *He replies quickly.*


[1/24/2025 9:15 PM] Narration
**"What will it be?"**


[1/24/2025 9:23 PM] Kaedues Staub
**"Having a gyro. Lamb meat, feta cheese, tzatziki sauce, hummus.. you know the deal. How much will it run me?"**


[1/24/2025 9:25 PM] Narration
**"10.50, with tax included."**


[1/24/2025 9:26 PM] Kaedues Staub
*Kaedues shrugs. Seems fair for a meal.* **"Sure."** *Kaedues looks down at the counter and sends the register m~~R~~10.50.*


[1/24/2025 9:45 PM] Narration
The employee would repeat the order to his co-workers in the back. It would seem that a large portion of his order was already completed by the time the instructions were finished. Given another 20 seconds and he was handed his food in a plastic bag.


[1/24/2025 10:04 PM] Kaedues Staub
*He takes the bag.* **"Thanks."** *He walks away from the counter and exits the shop without a second thought. Kaedues makes a point of moving to his van to eat. He unlocks the van's door and climbs inside. Before he eats the thing, he looks over his shoulder into the van's loading bay. Not that anyone could really sneak back there anyway, but.. just to be safe.*

*Seeing no one back there, he reaches into the plastic bag and takes out the gyro. It's wrapped in its own layer of synthetic paper that Kaedues knows to peel away just enough to take a bite. He holds the pita bread with both hands and raises the wrap to his face. His teeth sink into the bread, lettuce, meat and cheese...*

*..Something doesn't feel correct to Kaedues as he chews the wrap slowly. Something about the chewy bread, or the juice from the meat. Maybe it's the smell from the cheese..*
*It doesn't smell rotten, feel dry, or taste stale... so what gives? After a few seconds of thinking about it, Kaedues more or less wolfs the whole thing down. Kind of an irrelevant question, really.*
