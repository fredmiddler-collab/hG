[5/18/2023 10:13 PM] Narration
A couple days has passed since the destruction of ‚Å†Cat's Vid Shop. Cat had survived her encounter with Benedict and had not even caught his name or whom he worked for. Currently, Cat was situated against the railing separating the sidewalk and a creek below that had slanted concrete walls on both ends.


[5/18/2023 10:14 PM] Cat Bayes
Cat was silent, letting the tattered thoughts of her mind run through her head as she listened to the sound of the creek gently rush by, the muffled noise of the general populace congregating around the area, the honking of vehicles in the distant horizon...And yet, everything seemed so quiet to her.

Her shaky breath brushed against her sleeves, the hood above her head shielding her glowing blue eyes from the illumination of the neon signs around her. What could she do? Where could she go? Maybe...she could go to the CCR?...No, that dude definitely had ties with them if he was after that BD...not to mention the security detail he had tagging along, she'd be killed on the spot.

[5/18/2023 10:17 PM] Cat Bayes
**"Ugh..."** No matter what she thought of, it all came to a dead end...She buried her head into her arms, fighting the urge to just break down and cry right there. Fuck, she couldn't even reach for a smoke, that bastard even took that from her...a smoke...She thought about the last time she had a smoke with Paige...

**"..."** Removing a slip of paper from her jacket pocket, she examined it carefully.


[5/18/2023 10:18 PM] Narration
If Cat knew her way around, she would know that the address scribble onto the paper was relatively close by. 10 minutes from where she was.


[5/18/2023 10:19 PM] Cat Bayes
**"..."** *It's not far...she hadn't seen Paige in a while, which means something could've happened to her, given who she was running with...but it was her best lead.*

**"Alright Pags...you'd better be alive."** *She muttered under her breath, pocketing the address and adjusting the straps on her backpack, pocketing her hands as she started to walk down the street.*


[5/18/2023 10:20 PM] Narration
Cat would be nearing the address that she followed. Leading her to... what appears to be a building that has seen better days.. Probably not.

[5/18/2023 10:25 PM] Cat Bayes
**"What-"** *Aw fuck, did she have the wrong address or something? This place looks like it hasn't been used in decades!...Well, she was here now, might as well look around for whatever could pass as a door around this skeleton of a building.*

*It didn't take long to find what looked like the only useable entryway, standing in front of it with a sharp inhale and a heavy exhale, she raised her fist and knocked on the door.*

[5/18/2023 10:26 PM] Narration
The ambience of the world around was the only things that answered.


[5/18/2023 10:29 PM] Cat Bayes
*After a moment or two of waiting, Cat let out a frustrated sigh as she bounced on the heel of her foot.* **"...Um...Hello?"** *She called out to the door.*


[5/18/2023 10:29 PM] Narration
The only thing that came back was the echo of her voice that filled the abandoned neighborhood.


[5/18/2023 10:30 PM] Cat Bayes
**"...Ugggh, fuck this, I've got the wrong place."** *With a defeated groan, Cat began to turn around and started to walk away.*


[5/18/2023 10:32 PM] Narration
**‚Çõ‚Çï·µ§ff‚Çó‚Çë....** Something on the inside was disturbed... It was faint but enough for Cat to register.

**"...?"** *She wasn't hearing things just now was she? She turned back over to the door slowly...Did her knocking on the door somehow move something in- Nope, not even gonna continue to entertain that thought.*

*She moved back up to the door once more and placed her ear up against it...hesitating for a moment, she backed away and raised her fist to knock once more.*


[5/18/2023 10:39 PM] Narration
Before her hand could come into contact with the surface, both doors would swing inwards quickly. Before Cat's eyes was the barrel of a handgun.


[5/18/2023 10:39 PM] Paige
**"You picked the wrong fucking house fucker‚Äî Cat?"** She was just about to blow her brains. Good thing she didn't just blast through the door.

**"FUCK FUCK, SHIT, WRONG ADDRES-"** *Cat had fallen onto her ass, bracing herself in a flurry of panic before she finally looked up.*

**"...Pags?!"** *She exclaimed!*


[5/18/2023 10:45 PM] Paige
**"Damn it Cat, I mistook you for a Huscle or the CCR."** She would holster the gun on her leg holster. Something that Cat has never seen her carry before.. Of course for good reason with the doctrines and all. **"You OK?"**


[5/18/2023 10:47 PM] Cat Bayes
*After taking a few moments to shake off her surprise, she stood up and rushed her friend, pulling her into a tight hug!*

**"I'm so fucking glad you're alive, Pags!"**

[5/18/2023 10:49 PM] Paige
She was taken aback from Cat's eagerness to embrace her. It was not that she was uninterested but rather she was exposed. She would reach over for the doors despite having a Cat clinging onto her. **"It's not safe hanging around fatal funnels like this."**
When she managed to get both closed, she would turn her attention to her friend. **"Sorry if I worried you, I would have came back to the vid store sooner if it wasn't for these assholes looking for me."**


[5/18/2023 10:54 PM] Cat Bayes
*Cat had finally let go of her friend and put her back against the wall, taking a shaky breath as she closed her eyes, tilting her head up.* **"N-No...You're good Pags, I already figured some shit was going down when you didn't show up last week."** *Cat looked out of it, almost ready to cry it seemed... had something happened?*

[5/18/2023 10:57 PM] Paige
She looked towards Cat, clearly seeing the pain in her eyes, **"Choom, you look like you've seen a boyfriend zeroed or something. What's going on?"**


[5/18/2023 11:00 PM] Cat Bayes
**"Fuck, man...I got outed."** *She started, trying to calm herself down. Seeing her friend safe and sound felt like a huge weight had been lifted from her shoulders.* **"Some goddamned corpo fuckhead rolled up to the store and rounded up all the customers...That fucking BD? The project? It was *his* company."**


[5/18/2023 11:01 PM] Paige
Her eyes widened upon the revelation.  **"Shit Cat, w-what happened?!"**

[5/18/2023 11:03 PM] Cat Bayes
**"He fucking shot them Pags."** *She looked up at her, a mix between rage and horror in her eyes.* **"He shot the customers he rounded up after he got what he wanted, and set the place on fire with me still in it."**


[5/18/2023 11:05 PM] Cat Bayes
**"Nevermind the years I spent saving up and building that place up-"** *She sniffled, wiping her eyes.* **"I got those people killed, fuck man...It's my fault they're dead!"**


[5/18/2023 11:08 PM] Paige
Paige placed her hands on top of her head, pushing her flat against her skull. Pacing around the hallway. **"No fucking way...Were they trailing me...No no.. they would've done something sooner."** She would take pause, gazing upon Cat once more, kneeling before her. **"I'm sorry... I... should have been there. Maybe...."** No, there was nothing she could've done.. She would have been outnumbered, outgunned and certainly killed. She closed her eyes **"..."**


[5/18/2023 11:12 PM] Cat Bayes
**"No...No, there's no way you could've possibly known."** *For the moment, she managed to stabilize her breathing enough to get a coherent sentence out.* **"Those people...they didn't need to die, some of them had families, jobs, fucking lives and he just...he took them, without fucking hesitation."**


[5/18/2023 11:15 PM] Paige
**"I know....Those assholes will pay. We will make sure of it."** She would take a hold of her friends shoulder. 
**"Come on, we need to move. I need to take you deeper, its not safe here."**


[5/18/2023 11:19 PM] Cat Bayes
**"..."** *She took a moment to collect herself, nodding to her friend.* **"Yeah...Yeah, let's go..."**


[5/18/2023 11:24 PM] Paige
She would cross through a threshold and would open a hatch on the floor which led to a set of stairs. She would gesture for Cat to go first! **"The house is just a front, makes it easier to keep people movin ya know?"**


[5/18/2023 11:25 PM] Cat Bayes
**"Yeah, you had me fooled."** *She attempted to crack a joke as she moved down the hatch, looking around at her surroundings.*

**"So this is the oh-so 'infamous' Horizon Grey HQ, huh?"**

[5/19/2023 8:02 PM] Paige
Paige made it up to the ground floor, walking towards the doors. **"Soon you'll be walking and running out these doors like a pro."**


[5/19/2023 8:07 PM] Cat Bayes
**"I've got a ways to go before then y'know!"** *Cat was soon following behind Paige as she reached the surface, closing the hatch behind her.* **"But until then, I'm still a rookie, learning under your benevolent wisdom, O great wise one."**


[5/19/2023 8:10 PM] Paige
**"If I had a mag-fucking-cent beard, I would be running my hands through it like I am some Kinryu warlord or some shit."**
She would reach the door but did not immediately just open it. She would press her weight against it slightly, peeking it slowly.


[5/19/2023 8:12 PM] Cat Bayes
**"Oh my god, I see it now."** *She chuckled while she waited for Paige to give her the all clear.*


[5/19/2023 8:14 PM] Paige
She would push open the door, looking both ways before rolling her wrist and heading out. Signaling Cat that they were good.


[5/19/2023 8:17 PM] Paige
**"I keep the car somewhere else, reduces our footprint that way."**


[5/19/2023 8:22 PM] Cat Bayes
**"Makes sense, wanna make this place look abandoned."** *She was now following Paige's lead!*


[5/19/2023 8:23 PM] Paige
A few careful turns, watchful glances and making a break through an opening the two came across what appeared on the outside to be an completely abandoned garage. The doors shuttered close with weathered chains holding it closed against cement posts. 

**"Here we are."** she would take out a key, undoing the locks and pulling the chains away from the door. **"Not a lot of space in the garage. Don't mind waiting out here, would ya?"**


[5/19/2023 8:24 PM] Cat Bayes
**"Take your time, I'm cool with chillin out."** *Cat walked over to the wall and leaned against it.*


[5/19/2023 8:28 PM] Paige
**"Cool.."** She would open the door and walk in.
A few moments, Cat could hear the door to the vehicle. Then, then turning of the engine. Roaring to life as the muffler puttered with a low growl. Afterwards, the vehicle would roll out of the garage. A yellow and black muscle car that looked like it has been through the wringer a few times. Perhaps some ridiculous stunts here and there.

[5/19/2023 8:29 PM] Paige
**"Hop in."**


[5/19/2023 8:34 PM] Cat Bayes
**"Ooohoooo! I never knew about this beaut!"** *Cat took a few seconds to oogle the car before she giddily walked over to the door, hopping into the vehicle!*


[5/19/2023 8:39 PM] Paige
**"I've been working on her for a while. Needed something fast and could take a beating."** She would pull back her hand and remove a jack, plugging it in.


[5/19/2023 8:40 PM] Cat Bayes
**"I'm guessing you got into a lot of chases with her?"**


[5/19/2023 8:44 PM] Paige
**"A few, most recent one was with some Corpo asshole and his goons, but they don't know the streets because they aren't the streets."** She would start accelerating.


[5/19/2023 8:44 PM] Paige
**"They don't understand, it takes a different mentality to thrive here. Thinking they can just waltz right in and take what they want."**


[5/19/2023 8:47 PM] Cat Bayes
**"...Yeah, I know the feeling."** *She thought back to her store...it hadn't even been a week since that incident took place, the feeling of watching those people die still fresh on her mind.*

**"These shitheads are gonna pay though, we'll show them not to fuck with us."**


[5/19/2023 8:55 PM] Paige
She nodded, navigating the roads. **"Another thing we must keep an eye out for is the CCR and their nomads. You know, their surveillance drones?"**


[5/19/2023 8:56 PM] Cat Bayes
**"How often do they frequent this area?"**


[5/19/2023 8:58 PM] Paige
**"You must not get out often...Then again, you ran a Vid shop 24/7. So I don't blame you."** She looked left and right before going through the intersection. **"Not too frequently. Avoid major roads and that chance goes down."**


[5/19/2023 8:59 PM] Cat Bayes
**"Bitch, you know I'm a 24/7 hermit!"** *She laughed, punching her friend in the arm lightly.*


[5/19/2023 9:00 PM] Paige
**"Haha, yeah."*** She would point towards the open jack. **"Jack in, will keep you invisible to those nomad junkbots. A little tech I got for the vehicle. Pretty much the only tech to be honest."**


[5/19/2023 9:01 PM] Cat Bayes
*Made sense, Cat whipped out her wrist jack and chipped it into the port, downloading the firmware from the car.*


[5/20/2023 1:34 AM] Paige
**"We are going to be seeing if Digit wants to a have a little chat. He's cool..was...cool."**


[5/20/2023 1:35 AM] Paige
**"It's...complicated."**


[5/20/2023 3:43 PM] Cat Bayes
**"Digit?"** *That's a name she hasn't heard before.*

**"You think he'll wanna talk?"**


[5/20/2023 4:05 PM] Paige
**"Digit always has work needing done. I'll work something out with him. Would be the best way for you to gain exposure."**


[5/20/2023 7:03 PM] Cat Bayes
**"Huh, so he's a fixer then?"**


[5/20/2023 7:34 PM] Paige
**"A good one too."**


[5/20/2023 7:41 PM] Cat Bayes
**"Well shit, first time meeting a fixer for me!"**


[5/20/2023 9:00 PM] Narration
Paige would drive for about 13 minutes before they reached their destination. On the main road featured a bunch of venues that many of the underground and fixers love to hang around. CCR doesn't really fuck with area due to the altercations that usually take place.

[5/20/2023 9:00 PM] Narration
Paige drove around the back of one of the buildings. Back there, stood two chromed out mother fuckers who watched as they pulled in.


[5/20/2023 9:11 PM] Paige
She would put the car into park. Unholstering her gun just enough that she could rack a bullet into the chamber and putting it back. **"Can never be too safe. You know how to set the hammer on your Iron?"**


[5/20/2023 10:15 PM] Cat Bayes
**"Uh...I mean, I guess I did it in some BD's? Guy got shot in those though."** *She awkwardly grips the handle of the revolver with both of her hands, using her thumbs to slowly cock the hammer back.*

**"Like this, yeah?"**

{Reactions}
DBThumbsUp

[5/20/2023 10:25 PM] Paige
Well at least she had some simulation training. **"Yeah, like that. Come on."** Paige, turned off the vehicle and opened the door.


[5/20/2023 10:29 PM] Cat Bayes
**"Wait, should I put it in my pocket or what do I do with-"** *Err, she was leaving the car already. Fuck it, she put the gun in her pocket and opened the door, leaving the car as she 'tried' to look as intimidating as a little goth asian girl could.*


[5/20/2023 10:35 PM] Narration
The two guys rose their chins and crossed their arms. Sizing the two approaching. **"Guest parking out front, Chicas."** One of the guards would state.


[5/20/2023 10:40 PM] Paige
**"Zephyr Inferno with Seven."** She responded with, continuing to walk to the door. Must have been a codephrase.


[5/20/2023 10:41 PM] Narration
The two guys looked at each other briefly before looking back at Paige and Cat. **"..Blue hair chick with you?"**


[5/20/2023 10:41 PM] Paige
**"Yeah."**


[5/20/2023 10:47 PM] Cat Bayes
**"Uh...Yo!"**


[5/20/2023 10:47 PM] Narration
One of the guards would raise his eyebrows, sucking on his teeth as he stepped aside as he spoke into his earpiece. **"You got two coming your way."** He'd say, alerting Digit.


[5/20/2023 10:48 PM] Paige
**"Lets go."** She would tell Cat as she opened the door.


[5/20/2023 10:49 PM] Cat Bayes
**"Ahem...Fellas."** *It's cool, just be cool Cat...nothing wrong with acting a little social!*


[5/20/2023 10:50 PM] Cat Bayes
*She walked by the two bodyguards with her hands in her pockets, her head instinctively turtle shelling into her hood...Sure, she was raised in the hood and often got shit off the black market, but that was all through the net,


[5/20/2023 11:03 PM] Narration
Paige and Cat would ascend a flight of stairs at the back of what appears to be a club/bar mix. Upon reaching the top of the steps, there were two more guards who knew the drill. Stepping out of the pair's way.


[5/20/2023 11:03 PM] Paige
She looked left, right‚Äî ah, there was their man. With deep breath, Paige closed the distance between them and Digit.


[5/20/2023 11:03 PM] Digit
Digit was drinking something, looking at the wall as he waited for whoever the fuck was coming to see him.

[5/20/2023 11:04 PM] Paige
**"Long time no see Digit"** She would say, not even waiting for him to acknowledge him before taking a seat across the way.


[5/20/2023 11:07 PM] Cat Bayes
*Cat was still shadowing her friend...Paige looked entirely different when she was in her element, and when she clearly had beef with someone.*


[5/20/2023 11:07 PM] Digit
**"..."** With his head on a lowered angle, only his eyes followed her up to the point she fully seated herself.


[5/20/2023 11:20 PM] Digit
He spoke in a deep, brass voice. The way he looked at her suggested that there was a lot of unsettled history. **"What brings you back to D? Thought you were done fuckin with me."**


[5/20/2023 11:24 PM] Paige
She'd cross her leg over the other. One arm over the back of the booth. **"I __was__ done fucking with you, but biz have changed. My friend and I are needing some micros. You're the best fixer I know in these parts and so I came to compromise."**


[5/20/2023 11:24 PM] Digit
He would slowly sit back in his seat. But before going back completely, swiped his cup from the table and took a sip. **"Go on."**


[5/20/2023 11:28 PM] Paige
**"I'll do your heavy lifting work on a discount. Pay back what I owe and plus some. Give my friend here full paying gigs. she is new to the game and I need her up to speed soon."**


[5/20/2023 11:30 PM] Digit
With his head tilted to the side a bit, he shifted his eyes quickly towards Cat. Evaluating her briefly. **"A rookie? What kind of jobs we talking?"**


[5/20/2023 11:31 PM] Paige
**"She's a netrunner. Been doing it for a while. Some corpo assholes took everything she has so we are grasping at straws. Put her on some of your information gigs. It would do her good."**


[5/20/2023 11:33 PM] Digit
He thought about it for a long minute, evaluating the two. Was there anyway Cat was behaving currently?


[5/20/2023 11:38 PM] Cat Bayes
*As soon as Netrunning came up, it was like a switch flipped for who everyone assumed was a rather shy and incompetent girl. She stood up just a bit straighter now and even took a step forward, lowering her hood with both of her hands.*

**"You want info, plans, dirty little corpo secrets? That's my gig choom, I can get you some nasty shit."**


[5/20/2023 11:42 PM] Digit
With a slow blink and returning his gaze to Paige he would go to say, **"You're lucky you were my input for a while, Paige. Otherwise I would've told you to kick rocks."**


[5/20/2023 11:46 PM] Digit
**"How soon you looking to start?"** He'd ask Cat.


[5/20/2023 11:50 PM] Cat Bayes
**"Right away- sir."** *She looked at Paige for a moment as if she were trying to gauge her expression before looking back at Digit.*

**"Happen to have a set-up by any chance?"**


[5/20/2023 11:51 PM] Paige
Paige did not have that supportive aura about her. Looking at Cat as if she was her own. Biz.


[5/20/2023 11:52 PM] Cat Bayes
*Right, her moment to shine here...If she's gonna get into this biz, then she needs to start acting the part.*


[5/20/2023 11:56 PM] Digit
**"I just happen to have one, yes. I'll pair you up with one of my full-time 'employees'. "** His eyes would illuminate, he was contacting someone.


[5/20/2023 11:57 PM] Cat Bayes
*It was hard to tell in the flashing lights of the club, but the blue haired netrunner breathed a sigh of relief with her eyes closed for a moment.* **"Phew..."**


[5/21/2023 12:06 AM] Paige
**"One second, D. Got to speak with Cat here about something."** She would slide out of the booth from the other so that Cat wouldn't have to move so suddenly.


[5/21/2023 12:06 AM] Digit
**"Mhm.."**


[5/21/2023 12:07 AM] Cat Bayes
*Cat followed behind Paige for a moment, still trying to calm down from her confidence high.* **"Well...how was that?"**


[5/21/2023 12:12 AM] Paige
**"You left a good impression. If he doubted you then we would have been shit out of luck, sis."** She would pat Cat's shoulder, **"Like I say, you'll be where you need to be before you know it."** Her eyes lit up, she was transferring her contact information to Cat. 
**"You'll need a way to contact me when we are apart. Don't be afraid to text me or call if you run into problems. K?"**


[5/21/2023 12:17 AM] Cat Bayes
**"You're heading out?"** *It didn't come off in a "You're leaving me?" sort of tone, she was expecting her to dip once the business side of things were over with...but now that she being left alone, it was starting to weigh on her a bit.*


[5/21/2023 12:19 AM] Paige
**"Yeah, I am... We need the micros, Cat."** Paige's brows shifted up a bit. **"It will only be one or two gigs and we can start building up what you need."**


[5/21/2023 12:21 AM] Cat Bayes
*She nodded, it made sense to her.* **"Yeah...Yeah, I know just..."** *Nope, Cat stopped and looked around the bar, closing her eyes with a sharp inhale as she looked back at Paige.*

**"I'll be fine, you be careful out there, okay?"**


[5/21/2023 12:23 AM] Paige
**"I will, I promise. Digit will take care of you."**


[5/21/2023 12:24 AM] Cat Bayes
**"Yeah, that's the part I'm worried about."** *She chuckled, lightly slapping her friend on the arm. **"Don't get killed out there or I'll be pissed."**


[5/21/2023 12:26 AM] Paige
With a parting smirk and a fist bump the seal the deal, she would turn from her friend and would start to part from the venue. **"No one can kill Paige. Many have tried, all have failed."**


[5/21/2023 12:29 AM] Cat Bayes
**"Attagirl."** *She turned as well, returning the fist bump as she strolled on back over towards Digit.*

Nico sported modified fingers on both hands. While his right hand was more chromed out. His left knee cap had some kind of module protruding. Wires running from it to the back of the knee.

**"She got a spark to get down to business. I like this devushka. Come with me, I'll fill you in."** He would nudge his head towards another door. One which she and Paige did not go through.


[5/21/2023 1:08 AM] Cat Bayes
*Alright, they liked her so far! Right? That's what the guy said...the fuck's a devushka? Anyways, not important.*

*Cat followed her new employer towards the door.* **"So...what'll I be doing? Who am I going after?"**


[5/21/2023 1:18 AM] Nico
**"We are targeting a start-up corpo that just hit the market recently. Knowing that their infrastructure isn't set up fully. Want to crack their ICE before they buff it. At the same time, take action with an attacker."**

Opening the door towards the back rooms, he would hold it open for Cat. **"There are a lot of micros that can be pulled from their accounts that we will target. Isolated nets within their cloud. One of their nets was leaked by rookie security personnel. Besides that, the best thing about it is that they believe no one knows about it."**


[5/21/2023 1:23 AM] Cat Bayes
**"So I already have a backdoor to work with, perfect."** *She was in her space now....Cat walked into the room, observing the equipment while she began to remove her jacket.*

**"How hard do you want me to him them, which accounts am I targeting, how quick are they to respond to threats?"** *These were all standard procedure to Cat, gather information on her targets before she makes a move on them...normally, she'd watch them from a distance in the Net, but she didn't have that luxury here.*


[5/21/2023 1:36 AM] Nico
**"For now devushka, they are under the impression that no one has access. They are more busy setting up and monitoring their store fronts and other business avenues. Their response should be slow at best."**

He would take a seat in a chair beside tub. At least this one was a *bit* luxurious.  **"We are targeting a single account node 553.993.3. There lies their encryption key to access their banking for their logistics' payroll. We want to go unnoticed so we'll just interject our attacker and skate before those corpos know are even there."**

**"If, this goes smoothly we can benefit from a weekly check from our charitable donors for months to come without suspecting a damn thing."**


[5/21/2023 1:47 AM] Cat Bayes
*As Nico explained the job to her, Cat was busy removing the rest of the clothing that adorned her body, her shirt and pants lying in a loose pile on the floor next to her bare feet. She reached up to the back of her head, grabbing at something...the sound of tearing could be heard as a patch of fake skin and hair also fell to the ground, revealing a large port in the back of her skull.*

**"Get in, install a trojan horse, set a cronjob to deposit a set amount weekly to you guys, get out without a trace of me even being there...and get paid, sound about right choom?"** *Not waiting for a response, she lifted her leg over the edge of the bath and winced for just a moment at the feeling of the ice cold water stabbing into her bare skin...before she dipped in all the way, stepping in completely and sinking to the bottom of the tub with a shiver.*

Reaching her hand out, she highlighted all the entries and pulled them back, twisting her palm in a fluid motion until it became a ball of orange light.*

On the steps that led up to the back door of a liquor store would he find his man. Squeeps. Let's just say, he is a bit unhinged and really should get a haircut.


[5/23/2023 1:15 PM] Squeeps
**"Nu micwos, nu sauce. Fwuffy'm wunnin' a business hewe, not a damn cowpu chawity!"** His eyes lit up, as he was in a call while externally speaking.

[5/23/2023 1:20 PM] Ghostgaze
*Ghostgaze spotted Squeeps sitting on the steps that led up to the back door of the liquor store. The man's disheveled appearance and wild hair suggested a **lack of self-care**, matching his reputation as someone who was a bit unhinged. Despite his eccentricities, Squeeps had proven to be a **valuable source** of information in the past, often possessing knowledge that others couldn't acquire.*

*Approaching cautiously, Ghostgaze acknowledged Squeeps with a **nod.***


[5/23/2023 1:26 PM] Squeeps
**"Woah woah, howd up Fwuffy got a cwient. Fwuffy'ww tawk tu yu watew."** He'd hang up, standing up with his arms out.
**"If it isn't one of wy weguwaws! how've yu been man?"**


[5/23/2023 1:31 PM] Ghostgaze
*Ghostgaze's deep and rough voice cut through the air as he responded to Squeeps, finally breaking his silence.* **"Save the pleasantries, Squeeps. I'm here for business, not small talk. Give me what you've got about Paige Underwood."** *Ghostgaze folded his arms, his gaze fixed on Squeeps. He had learned over time that Squeeps had a **tendency** to ramble, and he wanted to avoid any unnecessary delays.*


[5/23/2023 1:32 PM] Squeeps
**"...I'm sowwy? what was dat? did yu just saeh....Paige..Undewwood?!"** His eyes went big.


[5/23/2023 1:34 PM] Ghostgaze
*Ghostgaze's eyes behind his mask narrowed, his patience wearing __thin.__* **"Cut to the chase. Where can I find her?"**

[5/23/2023 1:39 PM] Ghostgaze
*Ghostgaze looked at Squeeps with an unwavering gaze.* **"How much is it gonna cost me?"**


[5/23/2023 1:45 PM] Squeeps
He would suck his fake teeth, grimacing. **"Don't knu man, a few thousand micwos fu just some infowmation. Gonna cost yu at weast 10,000 micwos tu get a wocation."**


[5/23/2023 1:45 PM] Narration
That's quite a bit...Wonder why.


[5/23/2023 2:03 PM] Ghostgaze
*Ghostgaze stepped **forward,** his towering figure casting a shadow over Squeeps. He leaned in close, his intense gaze **locked** onto Squeeps' eyes. The air crackled with tension as Ghostgaze demanded an explanation.*

**"Why does it cost so much? What's so special about Paige that the price is this high?"**


[5/23/2023 2:23 PM] Squeeps
He would look around, making sure no one was listening. **"Yu don't knu about da infamous Paige? dat giww am a wegend, second tu Mathias Wiwdbouwne. Couwd've swown dwey wouwd have found a waeh outside of vespewa ow somethin' but...since yu'we hewe.. she has a bounteh an' if dat am da case, thewe am big moneeh invowved."**


[5/23/2023 2:30 PM] Ghostgaze
*Ghostgaze scanned the surroundings, ensuring that no prying ears were listening in on their conversation. He leaned in closer to Squeeps, his voice low and deliberate.*

**"I'm not here for tales or legends, Squeeps. I'm here for one reason only: to track down Paige Underwood and gather as much information as I can about her. __I don't care about the money involved.__ I want to know what makes her tick, what her weaknesses are, __and how to bring her down.__"**

*His words were direct, devoid of any sentiment or interest in the grandeur associated with infamous figures. Ghostgaze had no desire for fame or recognition. He was driven by a singular purpose, and that was to complete his mission **efficiently** and **effectively.***

**"Your job is to provide me with the information I need. The details, the connections, everything you can find. Money is not a concern, as long as what you deliver is __valuable__ and __accurate.__**"


[5/23/2023 2:36 PM] Squeeps
He'd narrow his eyes, **"Hu much am hew bounty?"**


[5/23/2023 2:44 PM] Ghostgaze
*Ghostgaze's gaze remained cold and focused as Squeeps inquired about the bounty on Paige Underwood. He maintained his detached demeanour, **unwilling** to divulge the exact amount.*

**"It's enough to cover my own living expenses,"** *Ghostgaze replied, his voice steady and enigmatic.*

*With a swift and deliberate motion, Ghostgaze accessed the __cyberdeck__ embedded within his masked helmet. Using the encrypted interface, he **transferred **the agreed-upon payment of **__10,000 micros__** to Squeeps' bank account.*


[5/23/2023 3:01 PM] Squeeps
**"Tch tch. Awwight yu got da wight gueh fu da job.."** He would lean in,
**"Wast I heawd am dat Pwaige weguwaws at a vid shop not tou faw fwom hewe. Weaw fwiendweh with da ownew thewe. mu intew am dat Pwaige am twyin' tu get buddeh buddeh with peopwe su dat Pwaige can wevive howizon gweeh."**


[5/23/2023 3:03 PM] Narration
Ghost's stored addresses would update, Squeeps giving him the location of the vid shop.


[5/23/2023 3:10 PM] Ghostgaze
*Ghostgaze's demeanor shifted, becoming more serious and formal as he delved deeper into the conversation. His piercing gaze bore into the individual before him, leaving no room for evasiveness or half-truths.* **"Now, let's get down to business. Who exactly is Paige affiliated with? I need to know the extent of her connections and any potential alliances she might have. No detail is too small."**

*His voice remained measured and commanding as he __continued__ his line of questioning.* **"Tell me about the video shop owner. What's their name? Are they involved in Paige's activities? I want to know everything you can provide."**

*Ghostgaze's attention then shifted to the matter of Paige's weaknesses in a hostile confrontation. His tone became even more direct, leaving no room for ambiguity.* **"When it comes to a face-to-face encounter, what are Paige's weaknesses? Does she have any vulnerabilities I can exploit? I need to know her strengths and weaknesses, her preferred tactics, and any patterns she might exhibit. Every bit of information can make a difference between success and failure."**

*With each question, Ghostgaze demonstrated his __professionalism__ and __single-minded focus.__ His determination to gather precise details and strategic insights underscored his reputation as a meticulous and formidable operator.*


[5/23/2023 3:54 PM] Squeeps
He'd scratch his temple, listening to the questions coming in. **"Yeah, Pwaige got connections Pwaige affiwiate with. Digit fwom yah woonies am a fixew in dese pawts.

[5/23/2023 4:32 PM] Ghostgaze
*Ghost maintained his focused composure, absorbing the information shared in the distinct manner of the informant. Despite the unusual way of speaking, he __deciphered__ the details and __processed__ them with precision. He nodded, acknowledging the knowledge gained. Paige's connections and affiliations were now clearer, and the names Kode, Digit and Cat would serve as potential leads to explore further later.*

*He contemplated the significance of __Cat,__ the blue-haired Asian owner of the video shop. While it appeared that her involvement may be limited to recruitment attempts, Ghostgaze knew better than to dismiss any potential avenues for gathering intelligence. Every piece of the puzzle mattered, and he made a mental note to __investigate Cat further.__*

*As the informant delved into Paige's means of escape and her reliance on a specific vehicle, Ghostgaze's mind worked swiftly, __formulating strategies__ to exploit her vulnerabilities. Disabling her wheels would limit her mobility, forcing her to rely on her cybernetics. **However,** the exact nature of her cybernetic enhancements remained elusive, a mystery that required further investigation.*

*Ghostgaze's tone was unwavering as he posed one __final__ question.* **"You've mentioned that Paige utilises her cybernetics. What other weapons or tools does she favour in combat situations? I need a comprehensive understanding of her arsenal to effectively __counter__ her tactics."**

*With his questions poised, Ghostgaze exhibited his relentless pursuit of knowledge, leaving no stone unturned in his quest to dismantle Paige's operations and ensure success in his mission.*


[5/23/2023 7:27 PM] Squeeps
**"Pwaige has awways been seen with an handgun. Nothin' mowe, nothin' wess. Woman twavews wight. Bwut! sidwe twpic, if yu don't mind. I am suwe it maeh intewest yu."**


[5/23/2023 7:31 PM] Ghostgaze
*As the informant veered into another topic, Ghostgaze's expression remained stoic, indicating his __willingness__ to listen. His quest for information left no room for distraction, and he welcomed any additional insights that could aid in his mission's success. Ghost nodded, acknowledging the informant's suggestion and silently urging him to continue.*


[5/23/2023 7:38 PM] Squeeps
**"N-nu I knu dat it isn't exactweh youw business, but I am cewtain dat whatevew da ccw am goin' tu payin' yu nu am as much as yu'd get if yu given hew tu my peopwe."** He was hushed now.


[5/23/2023 7:42 PM] soulrifthunter
translator: Now I know that isn't exactly your business, but I am certain that whatever the CCR are going to pay you is not as much as you'd get if you give her to my people."


[5/23/2023 7:46 PM] Ghostgaze
*Ghostgaze's gaze intensified as Squeeps mentioned the potential payment from his own people for delivering Paige Underwood. The notion of a higher reward __sparked__ a flicker of interest in Ghostgaze's otherwise impassive expression.*

**"I appreciate your insight,"** *Ghostgaze responded, his voice low and measured.* **"But my objectives extend __beyond__ mere financial gain. I have my reasons for pursuing this bounty, and they go __beyond__ the realm of conventional rewards."**

*Ghostgaze paused for a moment, realizing that he had __one more question__ to ask Squeeps. He leaned in slightly closer, his tone firm.*

**"Before I go, I need to know if you have any information on Kode. Where was he last seen?"**


[5/23/2023 7:48 PM] Narration
Another update to his address book.


[5/23/2023 7:48 PM] Squeeps
**"Tsk, tsk, hwe wowks with some cowpos in faiwview. Dat's da addwess."**


[5/23/2023 7:51 PM] Ghostgaze
*Ghostgaze nodded, __satisfied__ with the information Squeeps provided. Without uttering another word, he turned on his heels and started walking away, his mind already racing with __plans__ and __strategies.__*

*As he left the alleyway, he couldn't help but feel a sense of anticipation. The puzzle pieces were __slowly coming together,__ and he was determined to unravel the mysteries surrounding both Paige Underwood and Kode. With the address in hand, he knew where his __next destination__ would be.*

*Ghostgaze stepped into the shadows once again, his figure blending seamlessly into the urban landscape. **The hunt was on, and he was ready to track down his targets with relentless determination.***

**"That was preem, Devushka... First time working for someone else and all that?"**


[5/23/2023 11:37 PM] Cat Bayes
**"Mmmhnnngh."** *Coming out of the net was always a disorienting experience at first, but by this point, Cat had gotten used to it as she began to pant heavily while her brain reconnected to reality, her eyes slowly opening as she lazily sat up in ice cold bath with a shiver.*

**"Hoo, that's brisk..."** *She muttered before looking over a Nico with a tired smile.* **"Yeah, I've never taken a job for someone else before...gotta say, feels just like my usual work but with someone watching my back - which reminds me, thanks for the tip off on the trap."**

(There you go Nush, you can super react to it now)


[5/24/2023 12:16 AM] Nico
**"Should've tapped you in sooner, you could be swimming in micros running jobs with Digit. Been friends with Paige for a while eh?"**


[5/24/2023 1:06 AM] Cat Bayes
**"Haha, yeah. You could say I was her outlet for uh...certain illicit practices?"** *She shrugged, placing her hands on the edge of the tub before standing up fully, the cool air biting at her freezing wet skin causing her to grit her teeth slightly.*

**"You uh, wouldn't happen to have a towel or something, right?"** *Rubbing her sides with folded arms, she gave Nico a rather anxious look, ready to put some warm clothes on!*


[5/24/2023 1:11 AM] Nico
He would reach to his right, pulling over a towel for her. **"I'll go ahead and step out."**


[5/24/2023 1:12 AM] Cat Bayes
**"Thanks choom, I'll be out in a minute or two."** *Taking the towel, she wrapped it around her shoulders and began to dry herself off.* 

**"Oh, I should go and see Digit before I head out, right?"**


[5/24/2023 1:14 AM] Nico
**"Yeah, he's the one paying. I'll let him know of the job for ya. Save you the pressure."**


[5/24/2023 1:14 AM] Cat Bayes
**"Heh, you're a lifesaver man!"** *She gave him a wave.* **"Here's to hoping we work together in the future!"**


[5/24/2023 1:15 AM] Nico
**"Keep pulling scores like back there and there will always be a gig."** With that he would go see to Digit while Cat got dressed.


[5/24/2023 1:56 AM] Cat Bayes
**"Heh..."** *As soon as Nico left the room, Cat finished drying up and began to put her clothes on...however, Loft Logistics was still in the back of her mind.*

**"...Millions, huh...?"** *She muttered under her breath...for a company so blatantly amateurish in their security, they're pulling quite the amount of money...under confidential contracts no less. Mmmh...She'll definitely have to talk to Paige about this later, but for now it's time to go see her fixer! Stepping out of the room with (fyi) her clothes __on__, she walks on over towards Digit with a confident stride!*


[5/24/2023 2:22 AM] Digit
**"Nico told me all about it."** He was waiting for her. **"Not bad for a rookie in the biz. Paige does know how to pick'em, always had a eye for talent that woman."**


[5/24/2023 2:23 AM] Narration
5,000 Micros were wired to Cat's account from Digit.


[5/24/2023 2:23 AM] Digit
**"Paige said you get paid in full as if you were a regular. I am a man of his word."**


[5/24/2023 2:32 AM] Cat Bayes
*Cat's eyes widened as they flashed with the transfer of credits. 5000 was quite the hefty sum for her first job, and if she continued to take jobs from here on out, she'd be able to make much more! She'd be able to get her set-up from her old store back in no time...no, an even better set-up than before!...She was going to need it if she wanted to take on the world, and especially that monster too.*

**"I...shit man, that's a lot of Micros..."** *She huffed her surprise with a light chuckle, slipping her hands in her jacket pockets.* **"Alright, I'll keep taking jobs, and I'm not gonna let you down sir!"** *Leaning forward while tipping back on her feet, she held up a two finger salute with a big grin on her face!*m


[5/24/2023 2:38 AM] Digit
**"Heh, Paige is out right now. Working her gig. Relax for a bit, drinks on the house."**


[5/24/2023 2:59 AM] Cat Bayes
*She considered it for a moment, she definitely needed to destress a little bit after that whole experience with the lank patrol, shit, drinks were free too? Fuck it we ball.* **"Yeah, I think I'll do just that."**

*Lifting her hood over her head in an effort to avoid interacting with other people, she made her way over to the bar and sat down with a sigh.* **"Something light, need to simmer down."**


[5/24/2023 9:52 AM] Narration
The bartender would look over towards Cat momentarily before moving towards the dispenser for one of their smooth drinks. Pouring it into a shot glass and sliding towards Cat.


[5/25/2023 4:19 PM] Cat Bayes
*Catching the glass in her hand, Cat stared at the drink for a moment as she rolled the liquid around a bit before taking a sip. She'd drunken stuff like beer and scotch before, but it was usually alone in the basement of her shop...her shop...*

**"..."** *Feeling the slight bitter sting of alcohol resting in her throat, memories of that night came flooding back as the confident smile of finishing her first job became a less than nostalgic frown, her eyes grew half lidded as she cast them downward towards the bar, taking another shot of her drink before setting it down.*


[5/25/2023 6:40 PM] Narration
Her stay at the bar was much longer than she anticipated. What was a few minutes turned into a few hours. The tap of her shoulder is what brought her back to reality.


[5/25/2023 6:41 PM] Cat Bayes
*Cat had her head buried into her arms before the tap on her shoulders brought her back to reality, sitting up and turning to face whoever was trying to get her attention.* **"Mmh?"**


[5/25/2023 6:44 PM] Paige
**"Hey sis, finally back."** A few smidges of dirt on her skin and clothes. A single bruise on her cheekbone. **"How'd the gig go?"** She sat beside Cat, sighing as she finally is able to sit.


[5/25/2023 6:46 PM] Cat Bayes
**"Oh shit!"** *Time must've slipped from her mind while she was busy thinking about things, sitting up and turning she gave her friend a thumbs up!*

**"Went pretty good! Got five grand to my name now."** *She chuckled, before she examined Paige.* **"How bout you? Looks like you got roughed up a bit."**


[5/25/2023 6:51 PM] Paige
**"Nice!  I am as good as it I could be."** She would hang her head, grabbing the back of her neck and cracking it. **"Got into it a fight with some gang members. Nothing special. Knocking some skulls together and getting product off the streets for D."**


[5/25/2023 6:55 PM] Cat Bayes
**"Shiiiit girl, you must got some ≈åkina b≈çru (big balls) if you're going up against fucking gang members like it's a casual thursday."** *She held up a fist for Paige to bump.*

**"But a the end of the day, all it means is that we're one step closer to making those corpo fucks pay, right?"**


[5/25/2023 6:58 PM] Paige
**"One step at a time."** She would fist bump her back. **"Things at home need settling before we strike out on them in full force. 5 grand though, that should be enough to get the cables you need. Spoke with Mathias on my way back, tub has been secured and some...rudimentary pluming has been put in place. Going to need a professional for that one.."**


[5/25/2023 6:59 PM] Paige
**"I made only 2 grand going to pay off my debts mostly."**


[5/25/2023 7:02 PM] Cat Bayes
**"Oh shit, that reminds me...when I was hitting my target in the net, I found something pretty interesting."** *Cat's eyes flashed for just a moment, sending Paige some information...Loft Logistics, and their million micro confidential jobs.*

**"Something to look into later?"**


[5/25/2023 10:12 PM] Paige
She would relax in her seat, looking through the information. **"Yeah..Does raise some questions, doesn't it? Got to make sure to put this on our growing list of to-do's."**


[5/26/2023 3:02 PM] Cat Bayes
**"Like you said Pags, one step at a time."** *Cat stared at the empty glass in front of her, twirling her finger around the rim of the cup.*

*Lifting it slightly into the air, Cat called out to the bartender.* **"Can I get a refill? And something for my friend here."**


[5/26/2023 8:49 PM] Paige
Paige would face the counter, elbows and wrist pressed against table top, **"Only been a few days and you already look like a regular. Almost as if this kind of biz suites you. To be honest, I was worried you'd not be up to the challenge. Glad I was wrong. I hate to put you through something you would hate."**


[5/26/2023 9:28 PM] Cat Bayes
**"To be honest, I'm still a bit scared...I'm not sure whether or not all this bravado I've got going on is all from what I've seen from action BD's or something like that."** *Cat said with a sigh.*

**"But at the end of the day, I've got no other choice than to go down this road...It'd be kinda like insulting those twelve people who died because of me if I didn't, right?"**


[5/26/2023 10:10 PM] Paige
**"..."** The feeling was solemn, there was a break in the air; A pause. **"Reminds me of what happened back in Kilo... If there was one place I would never go back to, it would Kilo."**


[5/26/2023 10:19 PM] Paige
Paige's gaze grew forever distant, reliving the nightmare. **"I can only imagine what you saw."**


[5/26/2023 10:21 PM] Narration
Their drinks were readily available at this time.


[5/26/2023 10:22 PM] Cat Bayes
**"...Right back atcha' Pags..."** *Turning away, Cat wiped her face on her sleeve...whether she was crying or not was anyone's guess, but then she turned with a jovial smile, patting her on the back.*

**"Fuck, enough of this somber shit, let's just celebrate our first jobs...err...'sorta' together, yeah?"** *Cat raised her glass up to Paige!*


[5/26/2023 10:23 PM] Paige
**"Yeah, despite not working alongside each other, we are still a team."** She raised her own, with Cat. Downing it quickly.


[5/26/2023 10:24 PM] Cat Bayes
*And Cat would do the same, placing the glass down on the counter with an audible thud.* **"Ahhh...Here's to making a change!"**


[5/26/2023 10:28 PM] Paige
Paige smiled, when was the last time she had a friend to share a drink with? Too long is the answer to that. Paige was leaning on Cat far more than she would ever know. Being stuck with Mathias everyday kind of kills the vibe.

Her eyes would illuminate, receiving a call. At first her mouth parted slightly, curious. Not many people had her number. Then, visibly she looked surprised. Answering. 

**"I never expected to hear from you again.."** She focused her gaze forward.


[5/26/2023 10:29 PM] Cat Bayes
**"Mmh?"** *She turned her head, situation seemed like it got tense all of a sudden...she knew better than to pry, but god damn was she curious.*


[5/26/2023 10:30 PM] Kode

[5/26/2023 10:32 PM] Paige
**"I'm at D's, working off my debts. What's the biz, choom?"**


[5/26/2023 10:34 PM] Kode
> **"I've had at least 12 __part timers__ stop by for some quality time. Asking about you on their way out."**


[5/26/2023 10:45 PM] Paige
**"...Is that so?"** She would withdraw her pistol, racking the slide and putting one in the chamber. She was nervous to say the least. **"Fuck, that means they aren't far off my ass then."**


[5/26/2023 10:45 PM] Kode
> **"I had a __Choom__ dig a little. CCR got you marked as alive with a rather disappointing bounty sum if I may say so myself. After all the trouble you put everyone through, sheesh."**


[5/26/2023 10:45 PM] Paige
She would stand up, **"What are you saying?"**


[5/26/2023 10:45 PM] Narration
On the other end of the line, Kode is speaking with his head leaning downwards. A gun driven into the back of his head by a CCR official. Lawmen invested the room like there was some kind of raid.


[5/26/2023 10:45 PM] Kode
His eyes off to the side, clearly not liking the situation he found himself in. Having a gun pointed at you isn't fun. **"Tomorrow is going to be quite the day for you. I would skip out of the district and quick if you knew what was best for you. There is a route you can take that would let you slip without a trace. I suggest you take it sooner than later."**


[5/26/2023 10:46 PM] Paige
**"..."** This was nothing but bad news.  **"Fuck!"**


[5/26/2023 10:46 PM] Narration
The call hung up.


[5/26/2023 10:46 PM] Cat Bayes
*Cat looked down at the gun in surprise, turning her head back to check if there was anyone looking their way particularly hard.* **"Pags, what the fuck's going on?"**


[5/26/2023 10:47 PM] Paige
She would turn towards Cat. Panic in her eyes. **"I have to leave now or else this entire fucking block is going to turn into a warzone."**


[5/26/2023 10:48 PM] Cat Bayes
**"What the fuck...?"** *Cat stood up from her chair.* **"Is someone after you?"**


[5/26/2023 10:54 PM] Paige
She would take a second to process her thoughts, **"Yes, a lot of people are after me. And if I don't go soon then history will just repeat itself."**


[5/26/2023 10:54 PM] Paige
**"Fuck, Cat.. It wasn't suppose to go down like this!"** She place her hands on her head.


[5/26/2023 10:56 PM] Paige
**"Someone snitched and now the CCR really knows that I am alive."**


[5/26/2023 11:00 PM] Cat Bayes
**"Fuck...Pags!"** *Cat walked over and placed her hands on her shoulders, shaking her a bit.* **"If you need to go, then go, but I'm coming with you."**

*She looked directly into her friend's eyes.* **"History ain't gonna repeat itself, you hear me? We're gonna take care of this!"**


[5/26/2023 11:02 PM] Paige
**"Cat, I can't have you going with me."**


[5/26/2023 11:03 PM] Paige
**"I wouldn't be able to live with myself if you got killed!"**


[5/26/2023 11:10 PM] Cat Bayes
**"And you think I'd feel any different, or Matthias for that matter?"** *Cat let out a frustrated sigh as she closed her eyes, but backed away regardless.*

**"...Which is why...you better come back alive, or I'll beat the ever loving shit out of you, got that Choom?"**


[5/26/2023 11:22 PM] Cat Bayes
*Nodding her head to the door, Cat was basically telling Paige to get lost.* **"Once you're gone, I'll plug back into the net and try to make you disappear, but I'm not sure how long it'll last."**

**"Make that time count, got it?"**


[5/26/2023 11:23 PM] Paige
**"Yeah...Yeah...Got it.** No more pleasantries, she had to delta.


[5/26/2023 11:24 PM] Cat Bayes
*Cat watched her friend leave...hopefully, not for the last time. With that, she turned from the bar and focused her attention towards the crowd, where was Nico at?*


[5/26/2023 11:32 PM] Nico
He was sitting with Digit. Both of which were watching Paige as she delta'd out of there.


[5/26/2023 11:35 PM] Cat Bayes
*Oh great, he's with Digit...whatever, she briskly walks over towards their booth and rounds the corner, placing her hand on the booth wall and giving them a serious look.*

**"Yo, I know we just met...but I've got a favor to ask."** *She said, determined.*


[5/26/2023 11:36 PM] Nico
**"Devushka?"** He would raise an eyebrow. **"What you got?"**


[5/26/2023 11:40 PM] Cat Bayes
**"My friend's in deep shit, I need to get her out of here without a trace...I need to dive back into the net."** *She looked over at Digit.*

**"Consider it a debt if you want, I'll pay it off...but if she dies, then that is something I will live with for the rest of my life."**


[5/26/2023 11:47 PM] Digit
He would look between Nico and Cat before sighing. **"Nico."**


[5/26/2023 11:47 PM] Nico
**"Let's get you back in."** He would rock once before leaning into standing.


[5/26/2023 11:50 PM] Cat Bayes
**"Yeah."** *Cat started to stride over towards the room she was in not even an hour ago, as if she's already done it a hundred times before.*

*Walking in, she immediately threw her jacket and shirt to the ground, kicking her pants away as she hopped into the tub without hesitation, reaching back to plug the cable into her port.* **"She's probably on the move already, so we're gonna need to work fast. I need to find out just how deep she's in with this shit, and then...figure out how to make her disappear."**


[5/26/2023 11:55 PM] Cat Bayes

[5/28/2023 4:59 PM] Nico
It wouldn't take him long to settle in beside the ice bath. Overlapping one hand over the other, **"Currently, your friend is in a very deep hole. You'll need to narrow the search as much as you can or you'll be scraping the bottom of the barrel."**

**"How can we narrow the parameters without knowing them? Call Paige, we need a better understanding of what and who we are dealing with as soon as possible."** He would advise.


[5/28/2023 5:00 PM] Cat Bayes
**"Yeah, I'll patch you in as soon as I'm connected."** *Cat settled into the ice cold bath, leaning her head against the rim of the tub as she clutches the edges.* **"So much for celebration, yeah?"**


[5/28/2023 5:02 PM] Nico
**"Welcome to this side of the biz."**


[5/28/2023 5:03 PM] Cat Bayes
**"Is it always this chaotic?...Nevermind, don't answer that."** *She's in Vespera City for Christ's sake, of course it is.*

**"I'm ready, put me in."**


[5/28/2023 5:12 PM] Nico
**"Going in...3....2...and 1."**


[5/28/2023 5:12 PM] Narration
With the final countdown, reality soon became a intangible thing as she plummeted from the infinite confines of space. This time, she was not given a landing zone. Instead, she was descending on the entire network of what is believed to be Vespera. Nodes streching beyond the confines like claws into the darkness. Nico was right about narrowing down the search. She was now descending upon the net in its entirity.

[5/28/2023 5:21 PM] Narration
Ghostgaze swiftly moved into Littleton once more. Tyrek Block 1100 was just a block away.


[5/28/2023 5:24 PM] Ghostgaze
*Ghostgaze blends into the bustling streets of Littleton, his presence unnoticed amidst the hustle and bustle of the city. He moves with purpose, his steps guided by the information he obtained about Paige's location. As he approaches __Tyrek Block 1100,__ his senses heighten, his focus intensifying.*


[5/28/2023 5:27 PM] Narration
For those immediately around him, he was there and gone before they could react to his appearance. Swiftly moving about __like a ghost__. On his right would be an alley way that would take him to the heart of Tyrek. Or, he could use the sidewalk. Going the longer way, but he still can maintain his blending advantage. The choice was his, but time was ticking.


[5/28/2023 5:55 PM] Ghostgaze
*Ghostgaze assesses his options, weighing the advantages and disadvantages of each path. The alleyway presents a direct and potentially more discreet route, allowing him to navigate unseen and maintain his ghost-like presence. On the other hand, the sidewalk offers a longer but more inconspicuous path, blending in with the flow of pedestrians while still retaining his ability to remain unnoticed.*

*Time is of the essence, and Ghostgaze must make a decision swiftly. Considering the urgency of his pursuit, __he opts for the alleyway,__ recognizing that the direct route will expedite his progress towards the heart of Tyrek. The narrow passage grants him the advantage of being hidden from prying eyes, enabling him to move swiftly and undetected.*

*With a fluid and calculated movement, Ghostgaze veers towards the alleyway, his figure disappearing into the shadows. He traverses the dimly lit path with grace and precision, his footsteps silent as he navigates the twists and turns. His senses remain sharp, alert to any signs of danger or unexpected encounters.*


[5/28/2023 6:01 PM] Narration
As Ghostgaze traversed the alleyway there was a particularly familiar __hat__ on a person who sat on a empty crate off to one of the wall in the alleyway. The hat was tilted forward, shielding their appearance from outsides who might be walking by. They were armed, their pistol holstered in their thigh holster.


[5/28/2023 6:13 PM] Ghostgaze
*Ghostgaze, __recognising__ the familiar figure with the tilted hat, maintains a composed facade as he __walks past__ the individual in the alleyway. Despite the knowledge of their identity,__ he remains silent,__ keeping his true intentions concealed. His hand discreetly rests on the pouch where the __impact grenade__ is secured, ready to react if the situation escalates.*

*With each step, Ghostgaze maintains a __heightened level of vigilance,__ his senses attuned to any potential threat. His movements are calculated and deliberate, ensuring he doesn't draw unnecessary attention to himself. His eyes, hidden behind his mask, scan the surroundings, assessing the area for any signs of danger or unwanted interference.*

*As he passes the individual, Ghostgaze keeps his gaze fixed ahead, feigning disinterest while maintaining a mental map of the person's position and movements. __His training guides him__ to remain calm and composed, resisting the urge to confront or engage with the individual at this moment.*


[5/28/2023 7:12 PM] Narration
It was once he had covered a small distance that the familiar voice piped up to him.  **"That's not how you go about greeting your peers, now is it?"**


[5/28/2023 7:17 PM] Ghostgaze
*Ghostgaze, though __maintaining his silence,__ halts in his tracks as the voice pierces the air. His head turns slowly, revealing his red, ominous glare behind the mask. The intensity of his gaze conveys his __wariness__ and __readiness__ for any confrontation. With his hands already positioned near his weapons, he subtly prepares to draw the __Spectre SM5__ and retrieve the __impact grenade.__*

*His stoic demeanour remains unchanged as he assesses the situation, weighing the potential threat posed by the individual before him. The air becomes charged with tension as Ghostgaze's presence looms, a silent reminder of the danger he represents.*


[5/28/2023 7:19 PM] Narration
**"Well now, for a greenhorn just wet behind the ears, I'd have reckoned you'd show a touch more courtesy."** The man would have already been in the center of the alleyway. His gun already drawn and down to his side.

[5/28/2023 7:20 PM] Narration
With the tip of his hat, and the raise of his chin. It was none other than Luke Lonestar, one of the most notorious bounty hunters in all of District 9.


[5/28/2023 7:20 PM] Luke "Nasty" Lonestar
**"What's ridin' you into this neck of the urban jungle, partner?""**

[5/28/2023 7:30 PM] Ghostgaze
**"None of your business."** *Ghostgaze, his voice cold and deep, __breaks his silence__ with a single line that cuts through the air. As he speaks, he fully turns around, his left arm raised and __pointing at Luke Lonestar__ with his index finger, his elbow bent. This deliberate gesture signifies his __dominance__ and __assertiveness,__ even in the face of a renowned bounty hunter. __Though his left hand is no longer near the impact grenade,__ his right hand remains firmly on the handle of the SM5, a clear indication that he is__ prepared__ to fire if the situation escalates.*

*The intensity of Ghost's gaze and his imposing stance convey an unwavering determination and readiness. His masked visage adds an aura of mystery and intimidation to his presence. The air crackles with tension as the two figures stand locked in a standoff, each exuding an air of dangerous capability.*

But let me plant this seed in your noggin, greenhorn."** He tilted his head slightly, shifting his stance where his firing hand was closest to Ghost. Though, his weapon remained lowered.
**"That bounty's got my name on it, punk."**

[5/28/2023 7:37 PM] Ghostgaze
*Ghostgaze's grip on the Spectre SM5 **tightened,** his masked expression unyielding as he listened to Luke Lonestar's words. The revelation that the renowned bounty hunter had his sights set on the same target, Paige Underwood, did not come as a surprise. Yet, Ghostgaze's determination remained unshaken.*

*Without uttering a word, Ghostgaze slowly lowered his raised arm, his index finger no longer pointing at Luke Lonestar. His focus remained locked on his adversary, the red glow of his eyes piercing through the shadows of the alleyway. While Luke's weapon was lowered, Ghostgaze's grip on his own firearm did not waver, **a subtle reminder of his own preparedness.***


[5/28/2023 7:39 PM] Narration
**FLINCH**


[5/28/2023 7:39 PM] Luke "Nasty" Lonestar
He'd draw his weapon!


[5/28/2023 7:40 PM] Luke "Nasty" Lonestar
Timed with his cybernetics, his right eye would illuminate green. A reticle showing up in his iris. This is his favorite cybernetic; __Deadeye__.


[5/28/2023 7:41 PM] Ghostgaze
*As Luke Lonestar's hand moved to draw his weapon, Ghostgaze's instincts kicked in with impressive speed. Without hesitation, he swiftly brought up the __Spectre SM5,__ his finger instinctively squeezing the trigger. The sound of gunfire erupted in the alleyway as Ghostgaze unleashed a __barrage of rapid-fire shots.__*

*__Twenty rounds__ were unleashed in a matter of seconds, each shot propelled with deadly precision towards Luke Lonestar. The alleyway filled with the deafening roar of gunfire, the sharp crack of each bullet cutting through the air.*


[5/28/2023 7:45 PM] Luke "Nasty" Lonestar
He'd hone in on the first shot.
> "Perfect."
Firing a single shot aimed for the first bullet. Using his ability to pinpoint the most optimal time and position.


[5/28/2023 7:48 PM] Narration
The bullet would fly towards the first bullet on an angle. The two rounds would collide, the bullet of Luke's was heavier and contained cyberware within. The bullet would strike Ghostgaze's first round and would ricochet, diverting Ghostgaze's round off course. 

Luke's bullet would ping off the wall nearby, and target the second, ricocheting off of it. The second round deflected, bouncing off the ground and onto the wall. Then, it would go into the fourth round while Luke's bullet went after the third. This effect continued with each round. Soon, Luke's bullet caused all the airborne rounds to begin a fatal dance of bounces, chips off the walls and ultimately spraying the entire length of the alleyway going towards Ghost's position!


[5/28/2023 7:52 PM] Ghostgaze
*As the bullets collided and ricocheted off one another, a deadly ballet of deflected rounds filled the alleyway. The air became a storm of __unpredictable trajectories,__ as Ghostgaze's carefully aimed shots were thrown off course by the unexpected rebound. Reacting swiftly to the chaos, Ghostgaze's __instincts kicked in,__ and he dove towards the nearby low wall.*

*Using the low wall as cover, Ghostgaze attempted to shield himself from the cascading hail of ricocheting bullets. The staccato symphony of impacts and fragments echoed through the alley as the lethal dance unfolded. Ghostgaze hunkered down behind the protective barrier, his instincts guiding him to seek refuge from the deadly crossfire.*

*The rounds continued to bounce and ricochet off the walls, sending chips and fragments flying in all directions. Ghostgaze maintained his position behind the low wall, his focus unwavering as he monitored the chaotic trajectory of the rounds. Each impact reverberated through the alley, but Ghostgaze remained __calm__ and __composed,__ assessing the situation and waiting for the right moment to counter.*


[5/28/2023 7:55 PM] Narration
The rounds chipped at the low wall, chucks being removed as it was reduced to just enough where is body was concealed.


[5/28/2023 7:55 PM] Luke "Nasty" Lonestar
He'd pull the hammer to his hammer back again. Deadeye still activated. He slowly walked forward towards Ghost with the gun still raised. **"Ain't much fond of gunnin' down a brother of the jungle, but reckon it's all part of the trade, ya understand?"**


[5/28/2023 8:01 PM] Ghostgaze
*As Luke continued to approach, his gun raised, Ghostgaze's mind raced with __quick thinking__ and __adaptive strategies.__ With one fluid motion, he reached into his pouch, fingers wrapping around the familiar shape of a **smoke grenade.** Gripping it tightly, Ghostgaze swiftly __pulled the pin,__ activating the device, and launched it towards Luke with precision and purpose.*

*The smoke grenade soared through the air, leaving a trail of wispy smoke in its wake.*


[5/28/2023 8:14 PM] Luke "Nasty" Lonestar
Without missing a beat, he'd shoot the smokebomb in mid-flight.


[5/28/2023 8:14 PM] Narration
Smoke erupted, filling the alleyway with potent smoke.


[5/28/2023 8:14 PM] Luke "Nasty" Lonestar
He'd suck his teeth. 
> **"Crafty bugger."**


[5/28/2023 8:18 PM] Ghostgaze
*As the smoke swirled and billowed through the alleyway, Ghostgaze seized the opportunity to __retreat__ and make his way towards the __targeted location.__ Knowing that time was of the essence, he swiftly moved, his footsteps barely audible as he navigated through the dense smoke, utilising his knowledge of the surroundings to his advantage.*

*With each stride, Ghostgaze's determination grew stronger, his focus unwavering. __As a parting gift, he reached into his pouch, feeling the cold metal of an impact grenade.__ Pulling the pin with a deft motion, he launched the grenade through the smoke, aiming in the general direction of Luke. The grenade __soared through the air,__ disappearing into the haze as it sailed towards its target.*

*Without looking back, Ghostgaze __sprinted__ off, his form vanishing into the shadows as he made his escape. The echoing sound of footsteps faded into the distance, leaving behind a trail of uncertainty and intrigue. Ghostgaze remained resolute, undeterred by the encounter, determined to pursue his objective with __unwavering focus__ and __determination.__*


[5/28/2023 8:21 PM] Narration
The grenade would hit the wall high above and to the right of Luke. The detonation would blow a hole in the wall face. Sending cloaked debris down towards Luke.


[5/28/2023 8:21 PM] Luke "Nasty" Lonestar
Hearing the explosion come from high right, he would run back towards the other way. Effectively separating Luke from Ghost.


[5/28/2023 8:21 PM] Narration
The rubble would prevent Luke from pursuing.


[5/28/2023 8:22 PM] Ghostgaze
*Ghostgaze vanished into the shadows.*


[5/28/2023 8:23 PM] Narration
Ghostgaze could hear the sound of an engine rapidly approaching Ghostgaze's position. Someone was hauling down the road nearby.


[5/28/2023 8:29 PM] Ghostgaze
*Ghostgaze's keen senses picked up the sound of an __approaching engine__ cutting through the air. Recognizing the potential opportunity, he swiftly maneuverer through the bustling crowd, his movements deft and calculated. Dodging pedestrians and sidestepping obstacles, __he made his way towards the edge of the street,__ keeping his focus on the source of the approaching vehicle. Ghostgaze's determination surged as he closed the distance, __ready to seize the moment__ and utilize this unexpected turn of events to his advantage.*

Sensing the perfect moment, he __propelled himself forward, leaping onto the hood of the speeding car.__ His body moved with a fluid grace, landing with precision and agility, maintaining his balance amidst the chaos unfolding around him. Gripping the sleek surface of the vehicle, he steadied himself, preparing for the intense ride that lay ahead.*

[5/28/2023 9:12 PM] Narration
A bullet would strike Ghost in the facemask, hitting the cheekbone plate and deflecting. It was of a higher caliber, throwing off his balance.


[5/28/2023 9:17 PM] Ghostgaze
*With a cold and steely determination, Ghostgaze regained his balance and straightened his posture. __He locked his gaze on the occupants of the SUV, their actions etching themselves into his memory.__ The threat they posed became his __sole focus,__ overshadowing all other distractions. __In that moment, he made a silent vow to deliver them straight to hell,__ to unleash his wrath upon them with an unyielding fury.*


[5/28/2023 9:18 PM] Paige
She took this moment to give her car some more gas, flooring on it in hope to throw this asshole off!


[5/28/2023 9:20 PM] Ghostgaze
*As Paige accelerated the car, Ghostgaze found himself forcefully pushed onto the roof. Reacting swiftly, he managed to __secure his grip,__ gripping the corner of the roof and the passenger door tightly. The powerful force threatened to tear him away, but his determination and strength held him firm.*

*His red eyes burned with an unwavering intensity as he clung to the speeding vehicle. The wind whipped against his face, threatening to dislodge him from his precarious position. Yet, __he maintained his grip,__ his muscles straining against the relentless resistance.*


[5/28/2023 9:20 PM] Paige
**"Shit."** She'd whip the car, swerving into the intersection and going out left!


[5/28/2023 9:21 PM] Narration
The vehicles behind her were still in hot pursuit.


[5/28/2023 9:24 PM] Ghostgaze
*Ghostgaze seized the opportunity to swing off the roof, using the momentum to propel himself over the passenger side. With a swift motion, he __twisted__ his body and glanced back at the pursuing SUVs. Determination fuelled his actions as he retrieved his __second__ impact grenade from his pouch.*

*With a firm grip on the explosive device, Ghostgaze swiftly pulled the pin and launched it __towards the oncoming SUV.__ The grenade sailed through the air, its trajectory true, and landed with precision.*


[5/28/2023 9:32 PM] Paige
**"Can't talk, Driving!"** She would swerve into and out of oncoming traffic. Banking and drifting around obstacles all the same. Manually shifting as she cycled through the gears.


[5/28/2023 9:32 PM] Narration
One of the SUV's would pull ahead, but on its way past the grenade struck it's front wheel well. The vehicle would fly forward, flipping and tumbling as it veered into Paige's lane.


[5/28/2023 9:32 PM] Paige
Pulling hard right, she she minimized the vehicle's profile to the vehicle inferno. The bulk of the SUV just scratching the hood of her car.


[5/28/2023 9:32 PM] Narration
The SUV continued tumbling, smashing into the SUV still pursuing. Turning a one vehicle accident to a dozen car pileup.


[5/28/2023 9:39 PM] Ghostgaze
*Ghostgaze held on tightly as Paige skilfully maneuverer through the chaotic traffic, dodging obstacles and swiftly shifting gears. The impact grenade found its mark, causing one of the pursuing SUVs to veer out of control and crash into a violent cascade of tumbling metal. The resulting chaos created a temporary barrier, buying them some valuable time.*

*As the commotion unfolded, Ghostgaze's red eyes darted between the wreckage and Paige's determined driving. He knew they couldn't afford to slow down or hesitate. However, as the dust settled and the chaos subsided, Ghostgaze's gaze hardened, and his focus shifted.*

*Without a word, __he slowly raised his SM5, aiming it directly at Paige.__ His grip on the weapon was firm, and his intent was clear.*


[5/28/2023 9:43 PM] Paige
It was when he rose his weapon that he realized that Paige had her gun trained on him long before. She'd fire a round off at him while driving.


[5/28/2023 9:46 PM] Ghostgaze
*As the bullet whizzed past, Ghostgaze reacted with quick reflexes. __Releasing his grip__ on the passenger side of the car just in time, he propelled himself backward, __narrowly evading__ the incoming shot. His body moved with a fluidity born of honed instincts, and he __seized onto the tail end of the car,__ maintaining a firm hold with one hand while keeping his SM5 at the ready with the other.*

*The momentum of the car threatened to pull Ghostgaze off balance, but his determination and unwavering focus kept him anchored. With his red eyes locked on Paige, he remained vigilant, ready to respond to any further threats or attempts to impede his mission.*


[5/28/2023 10:17 PM] Paige
She saw an opening on a staircase leading up to the above street level metro tracks. She'd veer into that direction. Swerving erratically to keep Ghost from regaining himself and training a shot on her.


[5/28/2023 10:17 PM] Narration
The car would ramp up the stairs, jolting at the engine worked overtime, chugging the muscle car up the steep stair case. Once on the top, the car would fly 2 meters into the air before crashing onto the platform surface. Skirting around the platform, she'd drive the car onto the tracks.


[5/28/2023 10:17 PM] Paige
**"Nico! I am going to need to you steer, I got trouble!"** She'd pull her feet above the dash, smashing out the front windshield with her foot. Glass shattered and flown towards the back of the car as she shielding her eyes.


[5/28/2023 10:17 PM] Nico
> **"I'll try to keep her steady."**


[5/28/2023 10:26 PM] Ghostgaze
*Ghostgaze's eyes widened as Paige's car veered toward the staircase and ascended the steep steps. The sheer audacity and skill displayed by his target impressed even him. The car jolted and strained, the engine roaring in protest as it climbed higher, defying gravity with each upward lurch. Ghostgaze fought to maintain his balance, clinging onto the tail end of the car as it navigated the treacherous ascent.*

*Ghostgaze's eyes widened as Paige deftly maneuverer the car up the staircase, defying gravity and launching them onto the above-street metro tracks. The sudden ascent sent a surge of adrenaline coursing through Ghostgaze's veins, but his focus remained razor-sharp. He had to __adapt quickly__ to this unexpected turn of events.*

*As the car crashed onto the platform surface, Ghostgaze adjusted his grip, his gloved hands tightly gripping the car's frame to maintain his balance. The shattered glass from the broken windshield luckily didn't scatter around him. His SM5 momentarily forgotten, he __prioritized securing himself to the car,__ inching closer to the front as he braced for the tumultuous ride ahead.*

*Ghostgaze's mind calculated the risks and possibilities. The thunderous rumble of the car on the tracks reverberated through his body, adding to the adrenaline-fueled chaos of the moment. He knew he had to regain control of the situation, to catch up to Paige and __bring her down.__*

*His red eyes scanned the surroundings, searching for any advantage or means to close the gap. The wind whipped against his face. Ghostgaze's muscles tensed, ready to react to any sudden movements.*


[5/28/2023 10:31 PM] Paige
She'd pull herself out of the front of the car. Gun in hand as she managed to catch a glimpse of Ghost through the windows. She'd train her shot and fire off two shots!


[5/28/2023 10:41 PM] Ghostgaze
*As Paige positioned herself outside the car, her gun aimed at the windows, she fired two shots in quick succession. However, just as the bullets were about to impact their target, Ghostgaze swiftly pulled himself up onto the roof of the car, utilizing his agility and strength. In an instant, he activated his __cybernetic ability,__ causing his form to fade from Paige's vision: **__Ghostwalk.__***


[5/28/2023 10:46 PM] Paige
She thought she had him, standing up and pointing towards the roof. What she saw was...Nothing. She looked around confused with the wind whipping her hair wildly. She'd take a step on the roof, perhaps he slid off onto one of the sides? Still, she had her weapon at a low ready.


[5/28/2023 10:50 PM] Ghostgaze
*As Paige scanned the car's roof, searching for any sign of Ghostgaze, she was caught off guard by an unexpected attack. Out of nowhere, a swift and precise low kick struck the back of her knees, throwing her off balance. The force of the blow caused her to stumble forward, momentarily losing her footing.*

*Unbeknownst to Paige, it was Ghostgaze who had delivered the stealthy attack, utilizing his cloaking ability to his advantage. Remaining invisible, he capitalized on the element of surprise, exploiting the moment of vulnerability to strike at his opponent. With his enhanced agility and combat prowess, Ghostgaze swiftly executed the well-timed manoeuvre, aiming to disable and disorient Paige.*


[5/28/2023 10:53 PM] Paige
Her legs gave out and she smacked the roof of her car with her head due to the lack of warning. **"Gah!"** The gun still tight in her right hand.


[5/28/2023 11:00 PM] Ghostgaze
*With Paige momentarily off balance and her attention focused on regaining her footing, Ghostgaze seized the opportunity to further disable her. Reacting swiftly, he positioned himself strategically and brought his right leg down with force, aiming to stomp on the hand that tightly gripped the weapon.*

*The impact of Ghostgaze's stomp reverberated through Paige's hand, causing a jarring sensation that disrupted her grip on the gun. The intense pressure applied to her hand and the sudden pain sent shockwaves through her arm, making it difficult to maintain control over the weapon.*


[5/28/2023 11:41 PM] Paige
She'd grunt with the sudden pain shooting up her arm. She released the gun which caused the wind to catch hold of it, sliding it off the roof of the car and bouncing sporadically off the tracks. Her right hand was still pinned down, but she still made the effort to turn onto her back to see her attacker.


[5/28/2023 11:56 PM] Ghostgaze
*As Paige turned onto her back, her eyes met the chilling sight of Ghostgaze wielding a __lethal ice pick__ in his right hand. The glint of the metal reflected the intensity of the situation, and it became clear that Ghostgaze was not holding back. The imminent danger posed by the poised ice pick threatened to strike at the very core of her being.*

*However, just as the tension reached its peak, Ghostgaze's cybernetic ability was __deactivated,__ causing his invisibility to dissipate. The enigmatic shroud that had veiled his presence vanished, leaving Paige face to face with her would-be assailant.*

*Ghostgaze's intentions were clear, his expression unreadable behind his mask. The ice pick, a formidable weapon in his skilled hands, was aimed directly at Paige's head, poised to deliver a __deadly blow.__ The gravity of the situation hung heavy in the air, as the stakes reached their pinnacle.*


[5/29/2023 12:02 AM] Paige
Paige scrunched her face in fear and anticipation. She only had one shot at this. As the blade came down, she pulled as hard as she could to the right. This was moving away from her pinned right arm that was crossed from her body. By using her legs to spin, the pressure was lessened and she got more leverage.

Once the Ice pick struck the car roof, Paige bent her right leg and pushed her back forward towards Ghost. Hooking her right leg around his neck. The new found leverage allowed her to pull her hand free and get her left leg around his neck as well. She would then latch onto his weapon arm, limiting his mobility with it and weighing him down.

She knew it, she was outmatched in a strength competition. If she lost her leverage, he would kill her.


[5/29/2023 12:03 AM] Narration
Cat was now connected to a camera that was just up ahead. She could see just how much danger Paige was in at the current moment.

[5/29/2023 12:10 AM] Ghostgaze
*As Ghostgaze fought to break free from Paige's hold, he recognized an opportunity to turn the tables in his favor. With his weapon arm restricted, he swiftly unleashed a punch with his free arm, aiming directly for Paige's face.*


[5/29/2023 12:14 AM] Paige
She would take the face blow with balls of steel. She knew that if she let go of his weapon, she would be dead. Her legs became untangled from behind his head and her body hit the roof with a thud. But her hands gripped his wrist. Her eyes wide as Cat accessed Paige's optics. Ghostgaze is in perfect frame for Cat.

*With a direct line of sight right there for her, Cat had the perfect opportunity to hack into Ghostgaze! She wasn't gonna be able to kill him with his ICE, but she didn't need to! Cat began uploading the __Short Circuit__ Daemon to his mask! (A non-lethal stun attack that causes cybernetics to...quite literally...short circuit!)*


[5/29/2023 12:22 AM] soulrifthunter
(How fast it uploads is up to Ujie's discretion, but Ghost Gaze should see that he's being hacked)


[5/29/2023 12:32 AM] Ghostgaze
*As Cat initiated her hacking attempt, Ghostgaze's cybernetic instincts kicked in, allowing him to detect the intrusion in real-time. He could sense the digital presence attempting to infiltrate his mask and disrupt his systems. With a split-second realisation, he understood the imminent threat.*

*Reacting swiftly, Ghostgaze unleashed a __rapid barrage__ of punches towards Paige's face. His instincts took over, as he struck with precision and relentless force. Each blow was aimed to __disrupt her__ concentration and force her to release her grip on his wrist.*

*The punches rained down upon Paige, delivering a relentless assault as Ghostgaze sought to break her hold. He __wasn't certain__ who was behind the attempted hack, but in the heat of the moment, he had no intention of holding back. His priority was to stop his opponent and protect his own cybernetic systems from intrusion.*

*The ferocity and speed of Ghostgaze's punches demonstrated his determination and his refusal to succumb to the hacking attempt. With every strike, he aimed to disrupt Paige's concentration and buy himself enough time to break free from her grasp.*


[5/29/2023 12:38 AM] Paige
She'd take the first two, her grip and her ability to keep her eyes towards Ghost waived slightly. However, when the third and fourth punch came in she made an effort to ward off the attack with one hand now removed from ghost's weapon and used her arm to deflect some of the punches. Weaving her head in and out of the way all at the same time to keep him expending energy.

*Ghostgaze continued with his relentless assault. __However,__ in the midst of their intense struggle, an unexpected glitch occurred within Ghostgaze's cybernetic systems.

His attack halted abruptly as he experienced a temporary dysfunction, leaving him vulnerable and momentarily unable to continue his assault.*

[5/29/2023 12:45 AM] Paige
> **"Now."**
She'd rip the ice pick away from him. It would slide off the side of the car that was still following the tracks. With the new found momentum, she would bring her knees up to her breasts and would shove Ghostgaze as hard as she could towards the hood of the car. Perhaps if she was strong enough, he would go beyond the hood and get flatten by the car!


[5/29/2023 12:50 AM] Ghostgaze
*Ghostgaze's body slammed onto the car's hood, momentarily stunned by the cybernetic hack and the shove. As he regained his senses, he realized that he was back in the __same vulnerable position__ he found himself in earlier, perched on the hood of the speeding car. With his weapon lost in the chaos, he glanced around quickly, taking stock of his remaining options. He knew he had only his __knife__ and a few __grenades__ left in his arsenal, and time was running out.*

*Determined to regain control of the situation, Ghostgaze swiftly assessed his surroundings, looking for any opportunity to turn the tables in his favor. The odds were against him, but he remained focused and ready to make his next move.*


[5/29/2023 12:54 AM] Paige
She stood up on the hood, hurting and winded from the exchange. She began reaching into her back pouch as her labor breaths cut into the air.


[5/29/2023 12:54 AM] Nico

[5/29/2023 12:56 AM] Paige
Hearing the voice of Cat within her head warning her for an immediate stop, she would kneel down. Keeping her eyes on Ghostgaze who was still clutching onto hood.


[5/29/2023 12:57 AM] Narration
Then, the car came to a ABS abusive stop. The brakes locking up, smoke bellowing into the air. The wheels now dipping into the tracks more and more as the momentum stop. Three of the four tires snapping off of the rotors as it came to a sparking halt.


[5/29/2023 1:00 AM] Ghostgaze
*As the car came to an abrupt and violent stop, the screeching of tires and the smell of burning rubber filled the air. Ghostgaze's body lurched forward with the sudden halt, his grip on the hood __tightening__ to maintain his balance.*

*Surprised by the unexpected stop, Ghostgaze was momentarily caught off guard, his reflexes and instincts working in __overdrive.__ He quickly assessed the situation, realizing that he needed to act swiftly before the chaos unfolded around him.*

*With a surge of adrenaline, Ghostgaze __leaped off__ the hood of the car, landing on the ground with a controlled roll. He swiftly scanned his surroundings, taking in the damaged car, the smoky air, and the imminent danger that still lingered.*


[5/29/2023 1:03 AM] Narration
A droning sound could be heard crescendoing in the air. Something big was approaching but not visible to them?


[5/29/2023 1:03 AM] Paige
Her eyes scanned left and right. Trying to find out where the sound is coming from. Despite the bounty hunter standing right in front of her. His arsenal was limited and she knew this. Having a moment to breathe for a moment.


[5/29/2023 1:04 AM] Narration
The sound was deafening by then but still not physically apparent. Until a Photon Falcon rose into view from underneath the metro railway. It's mini-gun trained on Paige and Ghostgaze alike.

[5/29/2023 1:06 AM] Paige
Caught mid breath, she would hop off the roof of the car onto the other side and would go to leap off of the tracks.


[5/29/2023 1:09 AM] Ghostgaze
*Ghostgaze's instincts kicked into overdrive, and he quickly assessed the imminent threat. Realizing that the odds were heavily stacked against them, he knew that evading the incoming firepower was their best chance of survival.*

*Without hesitation, Ghostgaze sprang into action, following Paige's lead as she hopped off the roof of the car and attempted to leap off the tracks. Recognizing the urgency of the situation, Ghostgaze made a split-second decision to __pursue her.__ He knew that letting Paige escape could lead to dire consequences, and he couldn't afford to let his target slip away.*

[5/29/2023 1:16 AM] Narration
The Gatlin gun would fire off 70 rounds within a second, its caliber ripping into the vehicle, causing it to explode. One of the rounds grazing Ghostgaze's boot as he leaped off. The concussion from the graze caused Ghost to go into a uncontrollable spin as he descended.


[5/29/2023 1:16 AM] Paige
She'd land in a dumpster which she rolled out of.


[5/29/2023 1:21 AM] Ghostgaze
*Miraculously, the round that grazed his boot only inflicted a minor injury, a mere graze rather than a direct hit. However, even a grazing wound could have its __consequences.__ The force of the impact disrupted Ghostgaze's balance and sent him into an uncontrolled spin as he descended from the leap.*

*Though fortunate to escape more serious harm, Ghostgaze felt the effects of the graze. The pain and disorientation from the spinning fall threatened to impede his movements. Running at his usual speed might prove __challenging,__ at least for a while, as he needed to regain his equilibrium and recover from the shock of the near miss.*


[5/29/2023 2:00 AM] Narration
Ghostgaze would barely make it into the dumpster below. Paige by this time was already gone..?


[5/29/2023 2:02 AM] Ghostgaze
*As Ghostgaze landed in the dumpster, the impact jarred his body, exacerbating the pain from his graze. He winced, feeling the throbbing sensation in his leg as he tried to steady himself. Gritting his teeth, he took a moment to catch his breath and assess the situation.*

*Glancing around the alleyway, Ghostgaze quickly realized that Paige had managed to slip away during his descent. His red eyes scanned the surroundings, __searching for any trace of her presence.__ Despite his minor injury and the disorientation from the fall, he remained vigilant, determined to locate his elusive target.*


[5/29/2023 2:04 AM] Narration
It was at this moment when he looked around that a pair of hands came from behind him. Pulling him behind the dumpster.


[5/29/2023 2:06 AM] Ghostgaze
*Ghostgaze's instincts kicked in as he felt the hands on him, swiftly reacting to the sudden movement. He twisted his body, breaking free from the grip and swiftly turning to face his assailant. His eyes, still intense with determination, locked onto the person who had tried to ambush him.*


[5/29/2023 2:14 AM] Paige
While he spun around, she swiped his knife away from him. Holding out at this throat. Her face bruised and bloodied from their brawl **"I would have fucking killed you. If it weren't for the CCR..."**


[5/29/2023 2:14 AM] Narration
The bounty on Paige was lifted. As shown on Ghostgaze's mask display.


[5/29/2023 2:14 AM] Paige
**"This was a fucking setup and so now, you're going to pay me back. Ya? Not like you have a choice. CCR special forces are going to descend on us like flies."**


[5/29/2023 2:18 AM] Cat Bayes

*Ghostgaze's eyes narrowed as Paige held the knife to his throat, her words filled with a mixture of anger and frustration. He __understood__ the gravity of the situation and the weight of the bounty that had been placed on her. It seemed that fate had thrown them together once again, this time on the same side, albeit __reluctantly.__*

*He listened to her words, acknowledging the reality of their circumstances. The CCR special forces were a formidable force, and they would be relentless in their pursuit. Ghostgaze's mind raced, considering their options and the risks they faced.*

**"Convenient timing,"** *he replied, his tone laced with sarcasm. He scoffed, a mixture of frustration and resignation evident in his expression. He had his own priorities and mission, but he couldn't ignore the immediate danger they were both in.*

*Ghostgaze's gaze shifted momentarily to the display on his mask, confirming the bounty's removal. While he still harbored doubts about Paige's true intentions, the enemy of his enemy could, for now, be a __potential ally.__*


[5/29/2023 2:25 AM] Paige
**"Ghostgaze huh? Ominous as hell..."** She withdrew the knife, **"You'll get this back when you earn it. For now, let's delta out of here."** 

The roads were too risky. SF would have locked Littleton down. Alleys and secret passage ways it was. She would gesture for him to the left. There, a small pathway between the wall of a building the the wall to the metro was.

**"Narrow alleys make it so their AVs will have a harder time spotting us."**


[5/29/2023 2:29 AM] Ghostgaze
*Ghostgaze nodded at Paige's words, acknowledging her observation about the risks on the roads. He understood the need for stealth and the advantage of narrow alleys to evade detection by the pursuing forces. As much as he disliked being led by someone else, he recognized that he had no choice but to comply for now.*

*He touched the graze on his boot, feeling a slight sting, a reminder of the near miss he had just experienced. With a nod of determination, Ghostgaze followed Paige's lead, keeping a watchful eye on their surroundings.*

[5/29/2023 2:34 AM] Narration
The two followed the narrow alleys as far it could go. Behind them, they could hear the chatter of the CCRSF's radios which meant there weren't too far off their trail.

Before them was a 4 lane street. 2 going in the opposite direction. There was a security camera posted nearby that would capture them if they were too daringly cross.


[5/29/2023 2:34 AM] Paige
She would peer around the buildings just barely. **"Cat, what can you do for us? We are out of real estate here and they are on our asses."**

[5/29/2023 2:40 AM] Ghostgaze
*Ghostgaze glanced at Paige as she mentioned Cat, acknowledging the presence of the netrunner who had managed to infiltrate his cybernetic systems earlier. He couldn't deny that Cat's actions had caught him off guard and temporarily disabled him during their confrontation. Despite the troublesome encounter, he couldn't help but appreciate the __skill and resourcefulness__ of a netrunner capable of such feats.*

**"Cat, huh?"** *Ghostgaze remarked, his tone carrying a hint of __grudging respect.__* **"A troublesome netrunner indeed. I suppose having a friend like that comes in handy in situations like this."**


[5/29/2023 2:43 AM] Paige
**"Come on, if you play real nice I'll see if she'll give her number to you."** She'd tease despite having a serious undertone. She would run across the street as fast as her legs could take her.

```css
["Aw shucks, you two are gonna make me blush."]
```

*Cat tried her best attempt at a southern voice, it didn't sound all that great...*


[5/29/2023 2:46 AM] Ghostgaze
*Ghostgaze remained silent in response to Paige's teasing remark, his focus solely on the task at hand. He didn't indulge in playful banter, especially not in their current situation. As Paige darted across the street, he followed suit, his movements slow but calculated.*

*Ghostgaze understood the importance of staying focused and alert. He couldn't afford to be distracted by idle conversation or the prospect of exchanging numbers. Their priority was to navigate the narrow alleys, evade pursuit, and find a way to outmaneuver the imminent threat of the CCR special forces.*

*In silence, Ghostgaze trailed behind Paige, his mind constantly assessing their surroundings, searching for potential routes and escape options. He knew that every step they took had to be deliberate, every decision critical to their survival. There was no room for distractions or unnecessary risks.*


[5/29/2023 2:49 AM] Paige
Once across several lawmen SUVs rushed past them. Barely had make it. Following a web of alleys and back streets, she came across a manhole. Opening it up. **"I knew this was around here."**


[5/29/2023 2:51 AM] Ghostgaze
*Ghostgaze observed as Paige located the manhole and opened it up. He recognized the potential escape route it offered and nodded in approval, acknowledging her resourcefulness. Despite the intensity of the situation, he maintained his composed demeanor, showing no signs of surprise or excitement.*


[5/29/2023 2:53 AM] Cat Bayes
```css
["F-Fuck...Agh..."]

*Despite the praise from earlier, Cat appeared to be reaching her limit. This was her second time running within a short time period, and not to mention she's been at it for a couple hours with __this run alone__...Yup, she's gonna regret waking up.*

```css
["Hoh boy, hey Nico? I don't mean to boss you around...but do you think you could put a trash bin near the bath before I log out?"]

She would stop, looking over her shoulder for a second. **".. You think you can __scope the area__ out real quick?"**


[5/29/2023 3:02 AM] Paige
This question was directed towards Ghost.


[5/29/2023 3:07 AM] Ghostgaze
*Ghostgaze paused momentarily at Paige's request, his gaze fixed on her as she looked back over her shoulder. He assessed the urgency in her voice and understood the importance of ensuring their safety in the underground tunnels.*

**"In that case,"** *he replied in his deep and rough voice,* **"I need my knife back. No way of defending myself without it if I get ambushed."** *He emphasized the necessity of having his weapon at hand, recognizing that they were in a vulnerable position and needed to be prepared for any potential threats.*

*Ghostgaze extended his hand, gesturing for Paige to return his knife. The weapon was not only a tool of defense but also a familiar extension of his own abilities. With his knife in hand, he felt a sense of reassurance and control, ready to face whatever dangers may lie ahead.*


[5/29/2023 9:43 AM] Paige
Paige found herself in a tough predicament where delaying the inevitable was not an option. Though she couldn't trust Ghost completely, she knew compromise was necessary. As she twirled the knife between her fingers, Paige firmly gripped the handle before flinging it towards Ghost with precision.


[5/29/2023 9:52 AM] Ghostgaze
*Ghostgaze caught the knife with a swift and practiced motion, his reflexes honed from __years of combat experience.__ üòè He observed Paige's actions, recognizing the trust and compromise in her gesture. It was a subtle sign of cooperation, acknowledging the need to work together __despite their differences.__*

*With the knife back in his possession, Ghostgaze gave a curt nod of gratitude, his eyes briefly meeting Paige's before he shifted his focus back to the task at hand. He understood that time was of the essence, and they couldn't afford to linger in the open for too long.*

*Taking the lead, Ghostgaze proceeded forward through the tunnels, his senses sharp and alert.*


[5/29/2023 10:14 AM] Paige
**"These tunnels should be relatively safe. However, I can't recall the last time I've seen anyone use them."** Paige went on to explain with a hushed tone.


[5/29/2023 10:18 AM] Ghostgaze
*Ghostgaze listened attentively to Paige's explanation, his senses heightened as they navigated the dimly lit tunnels. The hushed tone in her voice mirrored the need for __caution__ and __discretion__ in their current situation.*

*He nodded silently, acknowledging her words. The lack of activity in the tunnels did raise some concerns, but it also presented __an opportunity__ for them to remain hidden from their pursuers. The unfamiliarity of these passages added an element of uncertainty to their escape, but Ghostgaze relied on his instincts to assess the situation.*

**"I've been in similar situations before,"** *Ghostgaze replied in a low voice, his voice carrying a sense of reassurance.* **"Sometimes the best route is the one less travelled. If these tunnels provide cover and keep us hidden, then they may be our __safest__ option for now."**

*As they continued deeper into the tunnels, the silence grew more profound, broken only by the echoes of their footsteps. Ghostgaze remained vigilant, his eyes scanning the surroundings for any signs of movement or potential threats. The darkness seemed to embrace them, concealing their presence as they ventured further away from the chaos above.*


[5/29/2023 10:21 AM] Narration
As they made their way through the tunnels, the pair could hear the faint hum of machinery in the distance. The air was thick with the smell of metal and oil. Every so often, they would pass by a rusted door, some of them ajar, revealing glimpses of abandoned rooms. The red light emitting from the duct above cast an eerie glow on everything around them, making the shadows dance and twist.

[5/29/2023 10:28 AM] Ghostgaze
*Ghostgaze's deep voice broke the silence, his words concise and to the point.* **"Your buddy Kode, he said you owe him 20 micros. Told me to relay the message to you if I met you."**

*His gaze remained focused ahead, his senses still attuned to their surroundings even as he spoke. Ghostgaze was not one to engage in idle conversation, but when it came to personal matters, he made his words count.*


[5/29/2023 10:29 AM] Paige
**"Shit, I forgot about that."** She'd say in response.


[5/29/2023 10:37 AM] Narration
The two resumed down the tunnel. The two were in a dark area when up ahead when two CCR lawmen declined down into the tunnel with their rifles. The lawmen were jumpy, and their hands were shaking as if they were expecting something to happen. Their eyes were wide and alert, scanning the darkness around them. They seemed ready to fire at any moment.


[5/29/2023 10:45 AM] Ghostgaze
*As the tension in the air thickened, Ghostgaze's knife skills and cybernetic enhancements kicked into action. He activated his **'Ghostwalk'** ability, harnessing the power of his cloaking technology to render himself invisible to the naked eye. The shadows embraced him, granting him the advantage of stealth in this precarious encounter.*

*With his senses heightened, Ghostgaze approached the two CCR lawmen silently, his footsteps __muffled__ and __undetectable.__ His Ka-Bar knife, a lethal tool in his skilled hands, spun with precision and readiness. His goal was clear‚Äî__to neutralize the threat swiftly and efficiently, taking advantage of their jumpy state and their distracted gaze.__*

[5/29/2023 10:48 AM] Paige
She watched as Ghostgaze cloaked. No time to be impressed, hunkering down. Needing to hide and wait.


[5/29/2023 10:51 AM] Narration
The two men activated the flashlights on their kinetic rifles. Looking down the tunnel. Paige had ducked into one of the ajar doors, rendering there would be visual on her not plausible. They walked beside one another, watching each other's back.


[5/29/2023 10:57 AM] Ghostgaze
*Unbeknownst to them, Ghostgaze had __already__ positioned himself behind them for a swift and decisive strike.*

*In a sudden burst of calculated movement, Ghostgaze lunged forward, his first target on his left caught off guard. With a deft twist of his wrist, the razor-sharp blade of his knife found its mark, slicing through the air with deadly accuracy. The lawman's throat was slit, a crimson arc of blood spurting forth.*

*Before the second lawman could react, Ghostgaze swiftly shifted his focus, his movements fluid and precise. The element of surprise was his ally as he closed the remaining distance. With a swift, lethal motion, his blade found its mark once again, penetrating the lawman's defences and severing a vital artery.*


[5/29/2023 11:00 AM] Narration
**"Arghchaugulrrrrr."** The first lawman dropped his rifle, grasping at his throat, and he started to choke on his own blood.

The second lawmen quickly turned to his choking comrade. But was ultimately stabbed just above the heart. He'd back pedal into the wall, grasping at his heart. With one hand, he would go to raise the rifle against Ghost!


[5/29/2023 11:04 AM] Ghostgaze
*Not one to be caught off guard, Ghostgaze reacted with impressive speed. In a seamless motion, he delivered a powerful kick, sending the rifle clattering away, out of the lawman's reach. With his free hand, he swiftly withdrew his knife from the lawman, crimson droplets splattering the ground. Without hesitation, Ghost pierced his throat with lethal precision.*


[5/29/2023 11:09 AM] Narration
The lawman would lose his gun immediately, grabbing onto Ghostgaze's arm as the knife drove right into his neck.


[5/29/2023 11:11 AM] Ghostgaze
*Ghostgaze maintained his grip on the knife, ensuring the lawman remained incapacitated. With a steady hand, he withdrew the blade from the lawman's neck, causing a gurgling gasp to escape his lips. The lawman's grip faltered completely, and he collapsed to the ground, life ebbing away.*

*Ghostgaze, unmoved by the violence he had just enacted, __calmly wiped the blood from his blade before resheathing it.__ He glanced at Paige, acknowledging the need to keep moving.*


[5/29/2023 11:14 AM] Ghostgaze
**. . .**

*With a swift glance around the dimly lit tunnel, Ghostgaze's eyes fell upon the fallen lawman's kinetic rifle. Recognizing the potential value of the weapon, he swiftly moved towards it, his gloved hand closing around the grip. The cold metal of the rifle felt __reassuringly familiar__ in his grasp, its weight balanced and ready for action.*

*Securing the rifle, Ghostgaze ensured it was in proper working condition. He checked the __ammunition,__ confirming a full magazine, and adjusted the settings to his preference. The weapon, capable of unleashing a hail of kinetic rounds, would serve as a valuable asset in the treacherous tunnels ahead.*


[5/29/2023 11:24 AM] Paige
She emerged from the shadows, picking up the rifle that the second lawman had lost from Ghost's kick. Lifting the rifle to rest between her arm and ribs. Muzzle pointed upwards as she walked towards one of the bodies. Looting them off their vest and immediate gear. She carried herself with class and purpose.**"If it weren't for you being a part-timer. I would consider you a great individual to know."**


[5/29/2023 11:27 AM] Paige
With the vest seized off of the lawman, she would adorn it upon her body. Making the necessary adjustments so that it accommodated her frame. Taking stock of all the magazines she acquired. Four magazines, nice.


[5/29/2023 11:34 AM] Ghostgaze
*Ghostgaze's eyes followed Paige as she approached the fallen lawman, deftly retrieving their gear with calculated efficiency. His expression remained stoic, his demeanour __unmoved__ by her words. When she commented on his status as a part-timer, he responded with a dry tone,* **"A shame,"** *his voice laced with a hint of sarcasm.* 

*Ghostgaze moved swiftly to the second lawman's body. He deftly searched through the pockets and pouches, his gloved hands methodically retrieving any useful items. Among the gear, he discovered __five__ magazines that were compatible with the rifle he had just picked up.*

*With practiced efficiency, Ghostgaze swiftly stowed the magazines inside his own pouches, ensuring easy access and quick reloads when the need arose. He knew the importance of being well-prepared in their dangerous predicament, and every resource counted.*

*On the other hand, he understood her subtle jab, acknowledging the irony of their current situation. Yet, circumstances had led them to this uneasy alliance, where their lives depended on each other's abilities.*

*Ghostgaze's gaze shifted momentarily to the surroundings, keeping a watchful eye for any potential threats. While he didn't show it openly, there was a hint of respect in his voice as he added,* **"We make do with what we have. Let's keep moving."** *With those words, he subtly conveyed his focus on the task at hand, silently signalling his readiness to continue their journey through the perilous tunnels.*


[5/29/2023 6:44 PM] Narration
Ghostgaze and Paige would traverse further down the tunnel with haste. Above them, they could hear the sound of tires upon asphalt. One vehicle passed over, Two cars passed, and the third came to a screeching halt somewhere relatively close to their position above.


[5/29/2023 6:46 PM] Paige
Paige noticed the sound of the sudden stoppage of the third car. Finding a set of pipes nearby, she would crouch down and wait. That could have boded better in their situation. **"Fuck choom, I think they're on to us."**

[5/29/2023 6:50 PM] Ghostgaze
*Ghostgaze's stoic demeanor remained __intact__ as Paige voiced her concerns about the sudden halt of the third vehicle. He understood the gravity of their situation and the potential implications of being discovered. His sharp gaze scanned their surroundings, assessing the available options and possible escape routes.*

*Without uttering a word, Ghostgaze nodded in acknowledgment of the situation. His instincts told him that staying hidden and avoiding direct confrontation would be their best course of action. He positioned himself beside Paige, ready to react swiftly and decisively if their hidden location was compromised.*


[5/29/2023 6:57 PM] Nico
> **"Nearby? We got one, but it would be risky getting to it. Updating everyone's navigations now."**


[5/29/2023 6:57 PM] Narration
The information was uploaded to Cat and Paige. Risky was right, the way there was exposed and they would have to run the risk of getting gunned down in the open.


[5/29/2023 7:01 PM] Ghostgaze

[5/29/2023 7:26 PM] Narration
That was now off the table as the ceiling above where they *once* was caved in. Concrete powder and debris polluting the air.


[5/29/2023 7:28 PM] Ghostgaze
*As the ceiling above them caved in, sending concrete powder and debris into the air, Ghostgaze instinctively reacted, while maintaining his balance and staying alert.*

*The sudden collapse of the ceiling signalled a significant change in their circumstances. It was clear that their previous route was no longer safe or viable. Ghostgaze's mind quickly processed the situation, assessing their options.*


[5/29/2023 7:29 PM] Paige
She turned her attention towards the source of the destruction. Readying her rifle along the top of one of the pipes to gain stabilization.


[5/29/2023 7:32 PM] Nico
> **"Damn, devushka. They found them. Stick to your plan, make sure any reinforcements are routed elsewhere!"**


[5/29/2023 7:39 PM] Narration
A hail of suppressive fire would start going down into their direction. Bullets flying everywhere. Ricocheting off of the walls, floor, and obstacles that separated Ghostgaze, Paige, and them.  Emerging through the smoke, CCR SF operatives would begin seeking cover of their own. It was a full blown fire fight!

[5/29/2023 7:42 PM] Paige
**"Special forces!"** She'd begin firing back. Flinching as some of the rounds got close. Steam erupting from the pipe she took cover behind. That was quite a large round.


[5/29/2023 7:43 PM] Ghostgaze
*With bullets whizzing through the air and the chaos of the firefight unfolding around them, Ghostgaze swiftly positioned himself next to Paige, seeking cover behind a stack of debris. His instincts kicked in as he braced his rifle along the top of a nearby pipe, using it to stabilize his aim and engage the CCR SF operatives. He fired __15 rounds.__*

*While maintaining a steady and controlled posture, Ghostgaze's eyes scanned the battlefield, identifying targets and assessing the best course of action. Realizing the need to create a diversion and provide some breathing room, he deftly retrieved an __impact grenade from his gear.__ With a quick motion, he pulled the pin and launched it over towards the SF operatives, aiming to disrupt their positions and draw their attention away from their current location.*

**"Grenade!"**, the SF would begin coherently fall back behind one operative who stood in front of the grenade incoming. The grenade would hit an invisible wall between the nade and the SF. Detonating and leaving the SF unscathed.


[5/29/2023 7:48 PM] Ghostgaze
*Ghostgaze's sharp eyes caught the maneuver, and although momentarily surprised by the unexpected defense, he __quickly__ adjusted his plan. With determination in his gaze, he continued to fire his rifle, squeezing off __thirteen rounds__ towards the SF operatives. Each shot was calculated and aimed at disabling their cover or suppressing their movements, in hopes of increasing the pressure on the enemy and limiting their ability to effectively return fire.*

*Ghostgaze's relentless assault served not only as an offensive tactic but also as a means to keep the SF operatives pinned down and on the defensive. His precision and focus were unwavering, as he aimed to __create opportunities__ for Paige and himself to maneuver and break free from the intense firefight.*

The SF weren't fodder and would not act as such. They used portable barricades that they brought with them. Others, taking cover behind other assortments of pipes and barrels.


[5/29/2023 7:50 PM] Paige
**"They're borg'd out!"** She'd withdraw her rifle from firing forward and to the side. There was a stack of metal barrels which was next to a large pipe. She'd fire, steam exploded from the puncture, knocking over the heavy steel barrels. Providing Ghost and Paige more cover to work with.

Mindful of his limited ammunition, he aimed to make each shot count. With calculated precision, he engaged in __spread-fire,__ unleashing a burst of __fifteen rounds__ towards the SF operatives.

She would pull her gun away from the fighting position. Pulling back as she evaded the hail of bullets until she maintained a covering position. **"Move!"** She'd begin suppressing the enemy so that he could fall back.


[5/29/2023 7:56 PM] Ghostgaze
*Responding to Paige's command, Ghostgaze swiftly __disengaged__ from his firing position, utilizing the distraction created by Paige's suppressive fire. He moved with agility, his instincts guiding him as he navigated through the chaotic battleground.*

*With calculated movements, Ghostgaze __tactically retreated,__ taking advantage of the temporary lull in enemy fire. He maintained his focus on manoeuvring to a more advantageous position, utilizing the cover provided by the environment to shield himself from incoming bullets. Ghostgaze's swift and precise movements allowed him to disengage from the immediate firefight and create __distance__ between himself and the SF operatives.*

*Ghostgaze, positioned by her side, understood the gravity of the situation. Despite the overwhelming odds, he remained __focused__ and __resolute,__ his stoic demeanor __unshaken.__ He braced himself against the cover, his eyes scanning the battlefield for any possible advantage.*

There was a door ajar just behind them to the left that led further into the tunnel network. The Beauty of it was that it led deeper underground and the door had a locking mechanism if they were able to reach it.


[5/29/2023 8:16 PM] Ghostgaze
*Ghostgaze seized the opportunity to strike. Taking aim with his rifle, he focused his attention on the vanguard, recognizing the threat he posed with his shielding cybernetic.*

*With precise control and unwavering determination, Ghostgaze unleashed the __13 remaining rounds__ in his magazine towards the vanguard. The shots rang out in quick succession, propelled with deadly accuracy towards the operative.*

The volley struck true. His body snapping into direction in which the bullet struck. Making him look like he was shaking. The rounds ripping through his body armor and striking the two other vulnerable SF's. Three of them would drop!


[5/29/2023 8:21 PM] Narration
With their vanguard out of the picture, the special forces were hard pressed on pursuing them. They took to the defensive against Paige and Ghost


[5/29/2023 8:22 PM] Ghostgaze
*With the immediate threat neutralized, Ghostgaze swiftly __released__ his empty magazine, allowing it to clatter to the ground. His experience kicked in as he efficiently __loaded a fresh magazine__ into his rifle, ensuring he had a full complement of ammunition at his disposal.*

*Though they had achieved a momentary advantage, __the battle was far from over.__ Their priority now shifted to seizing the opportunity presented by the partially open door nearby. __Deeper within__ the underground tunnels, they would have a chance to regroup and find temporary safety.*

*With his newly loaded magazine in place, Ghostgaze locked eyes with Paige, __silently conveying__ their shared determination to reach the door and secure their escape route. He stood ready, his focus unwavering as they prepared to make their move into the depths of the tunnel network. The remaining magazines in his possession served as a reminder of the firepower at his disposal, fuelling his resolve to overcome the challenges that lay ahead.*

[5/29/2023 8:24 PM] Narration
With the SF pushed beyond the concrete powder, they were completely visible. Though, if they were to reach the door, they need concealment.


[5/29/2023 8:24 PM] Paige
**"Got something to obscure their vision!?"** A round skipped over her head.


[5/29/2023 8:25 PM] Nico
> **"On it, let me try something!"**


[5/29/2023 8:27 PM] Narration
After a few seconds, the fire ceased on their end.
**"We got a net runner!"** One of the Special forces jar heads would shout!


[5/29/2023 8:27 PM] Nico
> **"Weapons jammed, but not for long!"**


[5/29/2023 8:28 PM] Paige
**"They're jammed, Ghost!"**


[5/29/2023 8:28 PM] Paige
She would come out of cover, laying accurate fire on their cover positions to increase the suppressive pressure.


[5/29/2023 8:31 PM] Ghostgaze
*Seizing the opportunity presented by the jammed weapons of the Special Forces operatives, Ghostgaze swiftly reached for his __second__ smoke grenade. With a fluid motion, he pulled the pin and lobbed it towards the enemy, __releasing a cloud of thick smoke__ that quickly engulfed the area. The billowing haze obscured the operatives' vision, further impeding their ability to track Ghost and Paige's movements.*

*Taking advantage of the chaotic situation, __Ghost and Paige wasted no time.__ They sprinted towards the partially open door, their footsteps echoing in the tunnel as they made their escape. The smoke grenade provided them with a crucial cover, concealing their path and disorienting the SF operatives.*


[5/29/2023 8:35 PM] Paige
She was last to enter. Turning around and shutting the door as fast as she could. In the moment, she shift the rifle since it was still on sling and would seal the door behind herself.


[5/29/2023 8:36 PM] Paige
**"Let's delta before they blow the door or worst figure out how these tunnels work."**


[5/29/2023 8:38 PM] Ghostgaze
**"Let's move."** *Ghost responded, his voice low and steady despite the adrenaline coursing through his veins. He understood the urgency of the situation and the need to keep moving, away from the encroaching danger and towards the uncertain depths of the underground tunnels.*

[5/29/2023 8:48 PM] Narration
It has been a few hours since Paige and Ghost narrowly escaped the clutches of the CCR. The safehouse that Nico had mentioned was indeed a safehouse. Tucked away in between a large quantity of houses. They were nestled in an abandoned house with boarded up windows.


[5/29/2023 8:49 PM] Paige
She was on lookout, the street light filtering through the opening between the boards. The rain poured from the sky above as night had fallen upon Vespera.

[5/29/2023 8:52 PM] Cat Bayes
*Waking back up in the now melted ice bath, Cat immediately retched and scrambled over the side, immediately grasping onto the rim of the trash bin and vomiting up what felt like a the entirety of her internal organs.*

**"Bleeeeghh!"**

[5/29/2023 8:52 PM] Ghostgaze
*Ghostgaze maintained his __vigilant stance,__ his back pressed against the wall, and his senses finely attuned to any potential threats. __With his gun at the ready,__ he scanned the surroundings, his gaze moving methodically from one point to another.*

*Inside the abandoned house, the sounds of rain tapping against the boarded-up windows provided a __somber ambiance.__ The dim light that filtered through the gaps in the wood illuminated the interior, casting faint shadows across the room. __Ghost remained silent, his focus unbroken,__ as he maintained his watchful position __near the door.__*


[5/29/2023 8:55 PM] Paige
Taking a moment to ponder, Paige glanced over towards Ghostgaze. Her mind weighed on what would be next. **"I take it you don't want to kill me any longer?"**


[5/29/2023 8:57 PM] Paige
**"As it has certainly been possible for you to do that for several hours now."** Went back to looking out the window.


[5/29/2023 8:57 PM] Ghostgaze
*Ghostgaze's gaze shifted from the door to Paige, his expression unreadable behind his mask. He remained silent for a moment, contemplating her words. Finally, in his deep and rough voice, he responded,* **"I've learned not to hold on to grudges. Circumstances change, people change. Survival becomes the priority."**

*His tone conveyed a hint of __detachment,__ reflecting his guarded nature. Ghostgaze __was not__ one to easily trust, but the events they had experienced together had forged a tenuous bond of __mutual reliance.__ Though his words were stoic, there was a sense of acknowledgement in his response.*


[5/29/2023 8:59 PM] Ghostgaze
**"I suppose my career as a bounty hunter is effectively over,"** *Ghostgaze admitted, his voice tinged with a hint of resignation.* **"Taking down enough CCR operatives has landed me on their list, and now I'm the one being hunted."**


[5/29/2023 9:01 PM] Paige
She leaned in towards the opening slightly, something caught her eye. **"Welcome to the club, it's nothing but dodging lawmen and living in the shadows. Guess you're used to that kind of thing... Minus the dodging of lawmen. That part is new. Before this, I was used to dodging the rent, not the law."**


[5/29/2023 9:03 PM] Ghostgaze
*Ghostgaze's lips curled into a faint, almost imperceptible smile beneath his mask. The corner of his eye twitched slightly, hinting at a silent amusement. Paige's remark broke the tension, injecting a touch of levity into their dire situation.*

**"You're right,"** *he replied, his voice laced with a dry humor.* **"Dodging lawmen is a recent addition to my repertoire. But living in the shadows and evading danger? That's old hat for me."**

*He paused for a moment, contemplating the contrast between their backgrounds. Ghostgaze had spent many years navigating the underbelly of Vespera, a world of secrets and clandestine operations.*


[5/29/2023 9:06 PM] Paige
Paige yawned. Once her yawn was finished she nodded in acknowledgement to Ghost's response. Slightly, she turned her head just enough that her eyes fell upon him.**"Where do you plan on taking things from here? You know, got some side gigs lined up or something? "**


[5/29/2023 9:10 PM] Ghostgaze
*Ghost met Paige's gaze, his eyes reflecting a sense of contemplation behind the mask. He adjusted his stance, shifting his weight slightly against the wall as he __considered__ her question. The rain continued to patter outside, providing a steady rhythm to their conversation.*

**"I wish I had a clear answer for you,"** *he began, his voice carrying a note of uncertainty.* **"But truth be told, I don't have a solid plan at the moment. My life was centred around bounty hunting, and now that path has become more __perilous__ than ever."**

*He paused, his gaze drifting momentarily towards the boarded-up window as if searching for inspiration in the rain-soaked night.* **"Survival has always been my top priority, and I've managed to carve out a niche for myself in the shadows. But now, with a bounty on my head, things have become more complicated."**

*Ghostgaze's words hung in the air, acknowledging the uncertain future they both faced. The once familiar landscape of his profession had been upended, leaving him in a state of transition. His mind raced with thoughts of finding a new purpose, a new way to navigate the treacherous streets of Vespera.*

**"I suppose I'll need to find a new way of living,"** *he continued, his voice tinged with a mix of determination and resignation.* **"Perhaps take on smaller jobs, lay low for a while. Figure out the lay of the land and see where it takes me. Survival comes first, after all."**


[5/29/2023 9:12 PM] Cat Bayes
*Meanwhile, Cat had finally managed to stop puking her guts out...hanging over the side of the tub, she weakly held her throbbing head, feeling as if it were about to be split right down the middle!*

**"Fhuuuck...Immuno-urp...Immunndo shupressants..."** *Oh yeah, her brain was this close to being mush...Nico had better find some immuno-suppressants for her and stat!*


[5/29/2023 9:12 PM] Nico
He would move his hand onto the counter, sliding the suppressant he had on deck and handing it to her.


[5/29/2023 9:16 PM] Cat Bayes
*Hearing the sound of the injector sliding across the desk, she raised her hand to grab it, only for her fingers to hit the edge of the desk and slide off limply until she managed to take it from Nico on her second try, tilting her head and injecting the green liquid into her neck as she let out a sigh.*

**"Unnnggghhh..."** *Aaannnnd...she was out like a lightbulb, still hanging over the edge of the bath.*


[5/29/2023 9:18 PM] Paige
She would take her rifle by the barrel, setting it against the wall before moving towards the center of the room. Arms crossed. **"Well, if it wasn't for you totaling my ride, punching me in the face more than a few times and nearly getting me killed I would say we had a pretty good time!"** Her jokes could be so sarcastic.

She stopped walking, leaning against a counter that separated the two rooms they occupied. 
**"But, you did something I was not expecting from you. Which was help me through all of that. You could have easily just stabbed me or shot me and you would've been fine... But you didn't. It's like you said, circumstances change, people change."**

Her eyes left his, looking towards the side. **"Thanks."**


[5/29/2023 9:19 PM] Paige
**"I'm just walking trouble. In the span of a few days I now owe two people favors...And Kode 20 micros."**


[5/29/2023 9:21 PM] Paige
**"With that said, you have now indirectly involved yourself with a member of Horizon Grey and helped her out quite a bit. Wouldt it not be far-fetched to say that you wouldn't be tempted to ask me for an application?"** She would look towards him with a cheesy smile and her head tilted slightly.


[5/29/2023 9:23 PM] Nico
**"Tsk tsk... You Horizon Greys are something else."** He would move to help get her out of the tub and dressed.


[5/29/2023 9:31 PM] Ghostgaze
*Ghostgaze listened to Paige's words, his expression remaining stoic even in the face of her sarcastic remarks. He couldn't help but crack a small smile at her cheesy attempt at humour, appreciating the lightheartedness amidst the weight of their circumstances.*

**"Well, you certainly have a way with words,"** *he replied, his voice tinged with a hint of amusement.* **"Though I must admit, you could've saved us both some time and just asked me directly."**

*Paige's offer lingered in the air, and Ghostgaze's gaze shifted from the floor to meet her eyes. His mind contemplated the possibilities, weighing the risks and potential benefits of aligning himself with a member of Horizon Grey. He had always been a __lone wolf,__ navigating the shadows on his own terms. But circumstances had a way of reshaping one's priorities.*

*He let out a subtle chuckle, his eyes reflecting a mix of skepticism and curiosity.* **"Joining Horizon Grey, huh? Now that's an interesting proposition. But let's not jump to conclusions just yet. I may have helped you out, but that doesn't mean I'm ready to sign up for a team just yet."**

*He paused for a moment, his tone shifting to a more serious note.* **"__However,__ I won't dismiss the idea entirely. The world is changing, and it seems that surviving alone might not be as viable as it once was. So, who knows?"**

*Ghostgaze maintained his cool demeanor, his eyes meeting Paige's with a sense of guarded curiosity. Deep down, he knew that joining a group like Horizon Grey could provide certain advantages and resources he could benefit from. But he also valued his __independence__ and the __freedom__ to operate on his own terms.*


[5/29/2023 9:36 PM] Paige
She would chuckle, **"I figured as much. Not often you come across someone who has as much experience as you do."** She turned from him, walking back towards the rifle and slinging it over her shoulder. **"The CCR lost our trail and enough time has passed. I should get back to Cat and get her home."** One last look towards Ghost. She'd upload her number to him, winking afterwards. **"Just in case you change your mind."**


[5/29/2023 9:41 PM] Ghostgaze
*Ghostgaze observed Paige's actions and listened to her words, his demeanor composed and focused. He acknowledged the gesture of sharing her contact information, silently committing it to memory. __A silent nod was his response,__ a simple acknowledgment of the offer and the connection they had forged through their shared experiences.*

*As Paige made her intention to leave clear, Ghostgaze understood the importance of prioritizing her safety and that of her companion. He respected her decision.*

**"Stay safe out there,"** *Ghostgaze finally spoke, his voice low yet sincere. It was a farewell, a wish for her well-being on the unpredictable streets of Vespera. No further words were needed between them as the weight of their unspoken understanding hung in the air.*

Cat's world was pitch black. Not a single dream nor nightmare disturbed her long-overdue sleep. She stayed in this dark and peaceful place for eternity. But soon, a voice called out to her, and the sensations of touch came about her; Her forearm.


[5/29/2023 10:13 PM] Cat Bayes
**"...Mmmuunnngghhh...Whhatt're you shaking me...for...shop doesn't open...for another five minutes..."** *In her sleeplike daze, Cat seemed to have forgotten for a moment where she was actually staying, trying to slowly swing her limp hand at whomever was attacking her peaceful rest!*


[5/29/2023 10:16 PM] Paige
It was Paige who caught her hand gently. Second guessing if she should wake Cat up, she would hold off on stirring any more. Would she awaken? **"..."**


[5/29/2023 10:20 PM] Cat Bayes
*...Wait a minute...the shop? No, that didn't make sense, this didn't feel like her bed...and what the hell was with that headache? Was she hung ove-...Nope, wait, memories were coming back now...Fuuuuuuck.*

**"Hnnggh...unnn...?"** *Ever so slightly opening her eyes, she looked up at the culprit behind her awakening...Oh, it was Paige...OH, PAIGE, FUCK!*


[5/29/2023 10:20 PM] soulrifthunter
**"P-Paige...? You're okay..."** *She wanted to say that with a bit more energy, but her body felt like it had just got catapulted through a couple brick walls and then some. She did __not__ have the energy for that.*


[5/29/2023 10:31 PM] Paige
She would stand up at the side of the bed Nico put Cat in and would embrace her. **"I told you that I would be. Though, it would have never happened if it weren't for you."**


[5/29/2023 10:35 PM] Cat Bayes
**"Ehehe..I guess our first job together was a lot sooner than we thought it'd be, huh? We really do make a great team Pags."** *She didn't have the strength to lift her arms enough to return the embrace right now, so she settled for a shaky thumbs up!*

She was going to try and get back to Mathias, but she thought about Cat's well-being. He'll have to wait. She would sit back down in the chair beside the bed. **"Get some rest tonight, when you're up to it let's head back home. I'm exhausted myself."**


[5/29/2023 10:45 PM] Cat Bayes
**"I feel you there sister...fuck, we should totally order like...thirty pizzas on the way home."** *She muttered on her way back down to the bed, looking up at Paige with a half lidded smile.*


[5/29/2023 10:57 PM] Paige

Ghostgaze arrived at the old cell tower on the south side of Littleton. In the old garage attached to the tower's building, vehicles which had been gutted and were parked outside the tower's abandoned construction. On the platform suspended up towards the top, Paige could be seen looking out towards the rest of Littleton and, beyond that, Fairview.

[6/1/2023 1:37 PM] Ghostgaze
*Ghostgaze's eyes scanned the surroundings, searching for a means to ascend the tower and join Paige on the platform. Spotting __a ladder__ attached to the side of the building, he wasted no time in approaching it. With calculated movements, he climbed rung by rung, his focus unwavering as he ascended towards his destination.*

*Reaching the top, Ghostgaze emerged onto the platform, where Paige stood, her gaze fixed on the sprawling cityscape before them. Ghostgaze approached her with a steady stride, his presence silent yet commanding.*

*Without a word, he stood beside Paige, his gaze mirroring hers as he took in the view.*


[6/1/2023 2:13 PM] Paige
**"Wanted to meet, so what's up Choom?"** Paige asked without moving much.


[6/1/2023 2:20 PM] Ghostgaze
*Ghostgaze stood tall beside Paige, his gaze fixed on the cityscape ahead. He could sense the weight of their impending conversation, knowing that the choices he made in this moment could shape his future.*

**"Things have taken a turn,"** *Ghostgaze began in his deep, rough voice, his tone devoid of emotion.* **"I've come to a decision. I'm willing to join your team."**

*He paused briefly, letting his words sink in before continuing.* **"__But understand this,__ Paige. I'm __not__ doing it for loyalty or camaraderie. __Survival__ and __self-interest__ remain my primary motivations. If I'm going to stand with you, it's because I believe it gives me the best chance to navigate this new world and ensure my own survival."**

*His words carried a sense of detachment, as if he had honed the skill of self-preservation to an art form. Ghostgaze's eyes remained focused __on the horizon (üòâ),__ his expression unreadable. It was clear that he approached this alliance with a calculated mindset, wary of the risks and mindful of his own survival.*


[6/1/2023 2:30 PM] Paige
**"I figured as much."** She broke her sight on the backdrop, turning towards him. **"This is Vespera. Not everyone has joined Horizon Grey to be __friends__. The CCR is a threat to the both of us. So, we have something in common."**


[6/1/2023 2:36 PM] Paige
**"There is a lot to be done. I won't sit here and pretend that Horizon is some huge organization. After what happened after the massacre has put us in single digit numbers."**


[6/1/2023 2:37 PM] Paige
**"Pull your weight and no one will bat an eye. Have access to whatever we have and who we have. The issue is that we need to rebuild."**


[6/1/2023 2:44 PM] Ghostgaze
*Ghostgaze's stoic gaze shifted towards Paige, his expression unfaltering.* **"I can contribute to the rebuilding efforts,"** *he stated flatly.*

*He paused briefly, his demeanour unyielding.* **"However, I prioritize survival and results above all else. My methods may deviate from __conventional approaches.__ If there are complications with that, inform me now."**

*Ghostgaze's words were direct, leaving no room for ambiguity. He was resolute in upholding his own principles, even within a group dynamic. His primary concern was ensuring that his effectiveness in the field would not be hindered by __unnecessary constraints.__*


[6/1/2023 2:51 PM] Paige
**"Conventional approaches? Listen, all I would ask from you is help out when we need it. OK? Not expecting you to brand yourself and wear a corpo suit."**


[6/1/2023 2:54 PM] Ghostgaze
*Ghostgaze remained silent, his silence conveying his **agreement** with Paige's statement.*


[6/1/2023 3:09 PM] Paige
**"Preem, we are in the process of recruiting more members and making money. Can't have a resistance without funds or people."** She would begin heading towards the ladder.


[6/1/2023 3:12 PM] Ghostgaze
*Ghostgaze followed Paige's lead, his steps steady and purposeful as they descended the ladder. He turned his attention to her, his voice direct and to the point.* **"Where are we heading, and what is my __exact__ role within Horizon Grey?"**

*He was ready to take on his assigned tasks, but he needed clarity on his specific responsibilities and objectives within the group.*


[6/1/2023 3:31 PM] Paige
**"You, my friend, are our muscle. Need someone out there who can shoot and not think twice about doing it. As for where __I__ am going. I am going back to our small rinky dinky base because I will do nothing but draw attention to myself."**


[6/1/2023 3:33 PM] Paige
**"I will have something lined up for you sooner than you may think. I'll stay in touch."**


[6/1/2023 3:35 PM] Ghostgaze
*Ghostgaze nodded in acknowledgement of his role as the muscle within Horizon Grey. He understood the need for someone who could act decisively and without hesitation when the situation called for it.*

**"Understood. I'll be waiting for your next move,"** *he replied, his tone firm and resolute. He respected Paige's decision to lay low and understood the importance of avoiding unnecessary attention.*


[6/1/2023 10:45 PM] Ghostgaze
*Before parting ways, Ghostgaze turned to Paige with a final question.* **"By the way, do you happen to know any reliable suppliers? I need a steady source of equipment and resources."**

*He kept his gaze locked on Paige, waiting for her response.*


[6/1/2023 10:51 PM] Paige
She was already heading out when he asked his question. She gradually came to a stop, turning around to entertain his question. **"There is 'The Metro' near Stacks."** She would detail. **"Normally, I would say to steer clear. But, you're not some push over."**


[6/1/2023 10:56 PM] Ghostgaze
*Ghostgaze nodded, taking note of the information provided by Paige.* **"The Metro near Stacks, got it Are there any __specific individuals__ I should be cautious of when dealing with them? Any particular details or precautions I should keep in mind?"**

*He understood the importance of gathering as much information as possible before engaging with suppliers in the underground market.*


[6/1/2023 10:58 PM] Paige
**"mmn... I wouldn't fuck with Squeeps if I were you. He's a bit weird to say the least."**


[6/1/2023 10:58 PM] Narration
Oh? Looks like Squeeps knows a bit more about Paige than what he lead on?


[6/1/2023 11:03 PM] Ghostgaze
*Ghostgaze's expression remained impassive, though a slight flicker of __annoyance__ flashed in his eyes. The mention of Squeeps and the insinuation that there might be some shared history between Paige and him piqued his curiosity.*

**"Squeeps? Do you two share some history?"** *Ghostgaze asked, his voice laced with a hint of intrigue. He wondered why Squeeps hadn't divulged this information during their previous interactions. It was clear that there might be more to their relationship than met the eye, and Ghostgaze intended to find out.*


[6/1/2023 11:07 PM] Paige
**"Why? You know him?"** She walked back towards him, eyebrow raised and her arms crossed. Her hips swayed as her feet struck the ground heavily.


[6/1/2023 11:10 PM] Ghostgaze
*Ghostgaze met Paige's gaze, his eyes narrowing slightly behind the mask.* **‚ÄùI've had some dealings with him in the past. Let's just say he's not the most trustworthy source, but he seems to know a lot about you. He is the one who gave me the names of your connections, and their whereabouts."** *His voice carried a hint of caution and suspicion.*


[6/1/2023 11:16 PM] Paige
She would roll her eyes, exasperating. **"The sicko has eyes on me for a while. Like I am some...corpo trophy wife. To answer your question more directly, yes I share some history with him. But nothing more than biz. I still have to watch my back, though. I'm not sure what he wants, but I'm sure it's not anything good. I'm just trying to stay out of his way and keep my distance."**


[6/1/2023 11:33 PM] Ghostgaze
*Ghostgaze maintained his stoic demeanor, his eyes fixed on Paige as he processed the information.* **"Squeeps is involved in __human trafficking.__ He sees you as a valuable commodity and is seeking to profit from your capture. He was willing to offer me a higher price than the fake bounty."**

*His voice remained detached and formal, devoid of any emotional inflection.* **‚ÄùAs a __former__ bounty hunter, I've come across individuals like him before. They operate in the shadows, exploiting others for their own gain. I will __make sure__ that he does not pose a threat to you or our operations."**

*Ghostgaze's experience kicked in, pushing aside any personal emotions. He had encountered many unsavory characters in his line of work, and dealing with them required a cool, calculated approach.*


[6/1/2023 11:35 PM] Paige
Her expression was one of subtle surprise **"Oh wow, and here I thought he just wanted in my pants. Good to know, thanks G."** She winked, **"Anything else you need?"**


[6/1/2023 11:39 PM] Ghostgaze
*Ghostgaze shook his head silently in response to Paige's question. He didn't have any further inquiries or requests at the moment. He maintained his stoic composure, waiting for her to make her departure.*


[6/1/2023 11:41 PM] Paige
She nudged his arm before saying, **"See you soon."**
Paige turned away from Ghostgaze and started off, going north.


[6/1/2023 11:43 PM] Ghostgaze
*Ghostgaze acknowledged Paige's nudge with a slight nod, but he remained silent. As she turned away and started heading north, he watched her for a moment before refocusing his attention on his surroundings.*

[6/4/2023 2:58 AM] Narration
As soon as he could, Danny rushed Kaedues to the hospital, acutely aware of the severity of his injuries. There was no time to spare, and he made a beeline for the emergency room. Kaedues' lack of insurance sparked a contentious dialogue with some hospital staff, but these disputes were swiftly put to rest when Danny played the corporate card.

With the admission hurdle cleared, Kaedues was promptly treated. The doctors, an accomplished and driven team, were up to the daunting task of addressing his injuries. They managed to save Kaedues' arm after a grueling procedure to realign the dislocated bone.

However, Kaedues' hand proved to be a far more challenging predicament. The extent of the damage was such that the nerves were beyond salvage, and his wrist had sustained injuries akin to being pulverized, according to the doctors. This situation would require a different approach and careful consideration; Removal.

There he rested, within the hospital bed. Banadages covered him from head to toe, sitching deep wounds closed and wrapping scraps, bruises and cuts. His right arm casted, his right hand was surgically removed during the operation. Within the room, Danny sat bedside. His eyes illuminated as he was reading a message. He managed to get a hold of Grace's father, but little information had come fourth within the 6 hours they have been there.


[6/4/2023 3:10 AM] Kaedues Staub
*`Kaedues looks forward in the hospital bed. He seems to be thinking about something while Danny holds his conversation. He thinks to himself. Mostly about the accident, but also about why it happened. Looking around the room, Kaedues notices that he still sees the world differently. He tries to place his fingers on his temples but winds up bumping his head on the nub of his right arm.`*

*`There it is, staring him in the face. It's hard to look at. Kaedues had tried not to think about how bad it was back when it all happened because he feared this might happen. Then, well, it did. He takes a deep breath before turning towards Danny. He was going to ask him if everyone already knows about her.`*

*`Kaedues' mouth hangs ajar for a moment before closing. His brows furrow and he looks down at his hand.`*
*`Memories outside of Shop 1113 surfaced. Grace didn't confess her fear for you. She confessed her admiration. Why do you remember it differently?`*

*`After a while the questions he asks himself point to the present and what he can do now. Unfortunately until any information about Grace is put out Kaedues can do very little. He thinks about his best course of action.`*


[6/4/2023 1:19 PM] Danny Donovan
The flickering amber glow in Danny's eyes dissipated. Stroking his beard in contemplation. He was finally engulfed in dread. The realization of the gravity of the situation had set in, and Danny's fear was palpable in the air as he weighed the matter. With a exasperation, running both of his hands through his hair. Danny would finally speak, **"Found Grace."**


[6/4/2023 1:34 PM] Kaedues Staub
*`Kaedues looks up at Danny quickly. His attentiveness to the phrase should express everything Danny needs to know.`*


[6/4/2023 1:42 PM] Danny Donovan
**"She has been flown to one of the hospitals in Fairview."** He answered plainly, looking down at the sterile floor.


[6/4/2023 2:02 PM] Kaedues Staub
*`"They won't tell you which?" Kaedues reaches for his IV, as if to pull it out. However, he quickly realizes he is biting more than he can chew because he can hardly muster up the strength to move his arm. That's not good.`*


[6/4/2023 2:02 PM] Kaedues Staub
*`Now he sits up in the hospital bed. He seems to have trouble holding his head up, but he looks intently at Danny. His eyes falter every now and then. Though it is one of the select few major accidents Kaedues has ever had in the workplace, he fears this one could have extended consequence.`*


[6/4/2023 5:49 PM] Danny Donovan
He would look over towards Kaedues, shaking his head as he answered his question,**"No, her father won't tell me which one she has been admitted to."**


[6/4/2023 6:03 PM] Danny Donovan
Danny rubbed his face, **"She's alive, so that counts for something."**


[6/4/2023 7:54 PM] Kaedues Staub
*`Kaedues swallows his own spit. He wants to protest, but there's no one who would listen. He feels angry at himself. Kaedues looks up at the ceiling. The bright overhead lights burn dark colors onto Kaedues' vision.`*

*`"I'm supposed to be better than this," Kaedues claims. He pauses for a long time as the weight of his own words make an impression on himself. "Danny..." Another long pause. "...I think there's something wrong with me."`*


[6/4/2023 8:25 PM] Danny Donovan
Danny studied Kaedues quizzically for a moment of time before opening his mouth to speak.


[6/4/2023 8:25 PM] Narration
It was at this moment the doctor would enter the room. Ceasing any conversation on the topic for the time being. The doctor had a digital tablet that he was doddling on,**"As we know, the surgery went without too many complications. Fortunately, you do not possess any life threatening injuries. Where is it you work? "** The doctor asked, not looking towards his patient.


[6/4/2023 8:31 PM] Kaedues Staub
*`Kaedues looks up at the doctor. "Workshop 1113. I'm a weapons engineer," Kaedues responds simply.`*


[6/4/2023 8:36 PM] Narration
**"Tsk ‚Ä¶Uhuh‚Äî got it. Well, you're discharged... Have your friend here help you exit right and take the elevator down to the car lot."** The doctor was very quick to dismiss him. Must've been a bad day.


[6/4/2023 8:53 PM] Kaedues Staub
*`Kaedues sighs. He reaches over and pulls out his own IV before scooting towards the edge of the hospital bed. He then climbs to his feet.`*

*`"Alright. Thank you." Kaedues looks over at Danny. "How much did that cost you?"`*


[6/4/2023 9:01 PM] Narration
The doctor was more than eager to leave. Almost out of the door before Kaedues finished saying 'thank you'.


[6/4/2023 9:01 PM] Danny Donovan
He would stand up, shaking his head. **"Not enough for me to asking for payment and charging you. Been a long day, man. Lets worry about these things later, eh?"**


[6/4/2023 9:02 PM] Danny Donovan
**"Let us focus on more pressing matters like uh ‚Äî work."**


[6/4/2023 9:18 PM] Kaedues Staub
*`Kaedues stops in his tracks for a moment. A long moment. He looks out of the door, but does not follow Danny yet.`*


[6/4/2023 9:44 PM] Danny Donovan
He would step out of the door into the hallway. Following the doctor's instructions. Though he would come to a stop once he noticed Kaedues not following him. **"Kaedues..?"**


[6/4/2023 9:48 PM] Kaedues Staub
*Kaedues perks up and immediately begins to follow Danny.* **"Sorry. I'm still exhausted. It's hard to think straight."** *Kaedues walks with a limp, but with the vigor of someone ready to wake up tomorrow.* **"Thank you again for helping me get here."**


[6/4/2023 10:00 PM] Danny Donovan
He took a deep breath. Probably because he thought something was wrong. He exhaled slowly, relaxing a bit after realizing that nothing was actually wrong. **"You worried me, choom. You're welcome. Come on, lets get you home."** He would turn for the elevator once more.


[6/4/2023 10:04 PM] Kaedues Staub
**"....Alright,"** *Kaedues complies. He follows Danny into the elevator, and eventually out of the building entirely. He doesn't seem bothered by the lights anymore either, so that's good.*


[6/4/2023 10:21 PM] Danny Donovan
The ride was quiet, the street lights illuminating the car. Humming of the vehicle's engine and tire treading. Danny's eyes focused on the road ahead of them. Danny was silent, his thoughts seemingly miles away. From time to time, Danny would glance over to Kaedues until finally he would break the silence. **"Something is wrong with you. What made you say that?"**


[6/4/2023 10:29 PM] Kaedues Staub
*Kaedues looks at Danny curiously.* **"....."** *He goes to rest his forehead on the fingers of his right hand but.. they aren't there.*
*Oh.*

*Looking at his hand, his thoughts swell and stir.* *`"I feel strange,"`* *Kaedues admits. He starts to tap his foot slowly as if trying to distract himself or ground himself.* **"....I don't remember Grace being in the van with me, Dan."** *He pauses.* *`"But I know she was there."`* *He tilts his head.* **"I wish I could explain it. I felt something bad at the time."**

*Kaedues gestures with his left hand. It looks awkward as he doesn't normally do that.* **"Do you ever feel __it__ tugging at you?"**


[6/4/2023 10:39 PM] Danny Donovan
Despite having his eyes locked on the road it was clear the question invoked some thought.
> **"The kid was just in a accident. They did not specify any brain damage occuring when the lab results came back."**

**"Yeah I get you... I don't ever see you and Grace hanging out after hours. Then again, I am always in a rush to get back to Fairview after work."**


[6/4/2023 10:40 PM] Danny Donovan
He glanced over for a quick second. **"But....__It?__"**


[6/4/2023 10:45 PM] Kaedues Staub
**"...Yes. You know, that sensation like you're watching yourself fall asleep?"** *Kaedues leans forward and begins to __attempt__ to fish into his back pocket with the nub on his right arm.*

**"Sometimes it's after a hard day's work and sometimes it's for no reason at all. Feels like something's in the back of your head, trying to pull you out."** *Kaedues stops and realizes yet again that he doesn't have a right hand. This time he doesn't care as much. Yeah, no right hand. We'll figure it out.*

**"Sometimes instead of back, it lurches forward...? You know?"** *He looks at Danny as if he's explaining something taught to grade schoolers.* **"Happens to me at work sometimes too."**


[6/4/2023 10:48 PM] Danny Donovan
**"... Had any severe head injuries in the past? As a child or something?"**


[6/4/2023 10:57 PM] Kaedues Staub
*Kaedues shakes his head.* **"No.."** *Kaedues looks upwards and * *`begins to think about it. Was he ever dropped? ...He doesn't know. Kaedues doesn't remember being dropped on his head. Come to think of it, he doesn't remember much of his upbringing at all.`*
**"I don't think I did."** *He responds simply.*


[6/4/2023 11:05 PM] Danny Donovan
He continued to look back and fourth between him and the road. Danny took a moment, mulling over Kaedues' words. However, his eyes remained fixated on the road and hard pressed too. His mind was teeming with a whirlpool of thoughts.

> **"This is different,"** Danny thought to himself,
> **"Kaedues has never spoken about this before."**

He found himself caught in a quiet, introspective tension. The phrase, 'watching yourself fall asleep' echoed through his mind. 
> **"Is this Kaedues' way of expressing some form of dissociation, a disconnect from reality or something?"**

He pondered on this for a moment, the hum of the car engine in the background offering a steady rhythm to his thoughts.
> **"Could it be the stress?"** He wondered. 

Work was demanding no doubt, but, when did Kaedues ever __struggle?__
Something wasn't sitting right. This wasn't the usual post-trauma conversation; Kaedues was trying to express something deeper, more elusive.

Danny glanced over at Kaedues, his face veiled by the shadows of the night outside, the occassional flash of streelight casting brief, fleeting illuminations. He seemed lost in his thoughts, awkwardly struggling with his absent hand. He was then brought back to Kaedues' question about a 'tug' -  the feeling of being pulled out oor lunged forward. He'd never really thought about it before. Were these feelings normal? Or was Kaedues experincing something far more complex?

**"Damn it, I wish I knew more about this stuff."** Danny chastised himself softly, the mystery of Kaedues' condition making feel woefully underprepared. He needed more information, and he'd have to tread carefully. After all, this was all unfamiliar territory, and he didn't want to make any hasty conclusions. Yet...


[6/4/2023 11:11 PM] Danny Donovan
His brow furrowed in concentration, as a seemingly insignificant conversation he'd had with Grace resurfaced. She had voiced an interest in understanding Kaedues, in uncovering what made him tick. At the time, Danny had brushed it off as a simple sign of affection, a curiosity driven by burgeoning feelings. But now, he realized it was far deeper, more complex.

The gravity of Grace's concern, initially dismissed as casual interest, suddenly took on a new significance. The mystery of Kaedues' condition wasn't simply a personal conundrum, it was a puzzle that potentially affected others around him. The silly little thing that had sparked Grace's interest was actually a matter of depth and concern.

The realization was as enlightening as it was daunting, casting a new light on Kaedues and his situation. And yet, despite the uncertainty, Danny knew one thing for sure...

He'd ***immediately*** began to make a call. His eyes glowing and casting a soft yellow hue off the steering wheel and dashboard.

*Kaedues shrugs. He assumes that Danny has an important business call to make that he perhaps forgot about. While he waits, he sits upright and looks forward at the road. Then, he looks at the inside of Danny's car for the first time, just familiarizing himself. Then, he looks at his hand and speaks softly.*

**"I'll have to get a new hobby. Can't freerun anymore without a hand."**
*Freerunning was one of the only things you could really get Kaedues to talk about. Even then it's difficult to get Kaedues to open up about anything... but Kaedues and freerunning go together like bread and butter.*

**"I could get a project car. Work on it for a few years."**

The evening of the Paige incident...


[6/11/2023 11:32 PM] Narration
The crime scene was enourmous to say the least. If it was not for the assistance of the drone units they had, any kind of incident reconstruction would've taken days to even weeks to compile. Forensics teams scoured the area for anything that could lead them closer to the truth. Roads closed off with the assistance of the heavy CCR presence. Armored vehicles and armed personnel patrolling the neighboring streets.


[6/11/2023 11:34 PM] Narration
As the camera slowly panned across the empty street one team of forensics specialists were reconstructing a segment in which Paige was running from the bounty hunters that were in a car chase. Further down the road, more personnel were marking bullet casings with digital tags, utilizing their data pads to keep records of their findings. Drones illuminating the streets with blinking white light.


[6/11/2023 11:37 PM] Narration
The camera would begin to focus on one individual who was entering the crime scene, putting on his gloves and sighing. He was approaching one of the primary controllers for the scene.


[6/11/2023 11:37 PM] Lt. John Hilton
**"Can't go one day without something going to shit eh?"** The man wore formal black uniform, a sign of his higher status within the CCR.

[6/11/2023 11:44 PM] Lt. John Hilton
**"When does the captain's plans ever work?"** He asked as he took the datapad, scrolling through its contents. **"Paige Underwood."** He would read off the name in the report.

**"Yes sir, infamous member in the organization from what I know. Who would've known that they survived Kilo."**


[6/11/2023 11:44 PM] Lt. John Hilton
**"Not too surprised about that either."** He would begin walking. Aside him the controller would accompany him. **"Where is Sergeant Bailey?"**


[6/11/2023 11:44 PM] Narration
**"Investigating the house they were tracked to, sir. Bailey has been following the trail since they were dispatched."**


[6/11/2023 11:44 PM] Lt. John Hilton
**"That one?"** He looked up from the datapad to the house where Paige and Ghost was holed up in for a few hours.


[6/11/2023 11:46 PM] Narration
**"That would be correct, sir."**


[6/11/2023 11:46 PM] Lt. John Hilton
He would hand the datapad to the controller. **"Lock down Littleton would you? Not a single damn checkpoint was set up while I flown down here."**


[6/11/2023 11:46 PM] Narration
**"At once, sir."** The controller would take the datapad and would begin speaking over his radio, ordering units to begin locking down the area.


[6/11/2023 11:48 PM] Lt. John Hilton
John stepped into the house and at the counter, Sergeant Bailey was going over a bunch of information. Several datapads laid scattered across the counter top. Additionally, the weapons that were recovered during the investigation. Ghostgaze's gun and ice pick and Paige's pistol. **"Talk to me."**


[6/11/2023 11:52 PM] Sgt. Heather Bailey
**"Sir, going over what we uncovered so far."**


[6/11/2023 11:52 PM] Lt. John Hilton
**"What is it that we uncovered?"**


[6/11/2023 11:52 PM] Sgt. Heather Bailey
**"Primarily where we went wrong. There were many flaws within the captains ploy. Too many gaps for our target to slip through and ultimately that is what occurred."**

[6/11/2023 11:52 PM] Sgt. Heather Bailey
**"Took some time to pull the biometric data off of the pistol. A positive match to old records to Paige Underwood. That gun you are holding however, belongs to the bounty hunter who assisted her escape."**


[6/11/2023 11:56 PM] Lt. John Hilton
Sigh, setting the gun down and walking around the counter, **"A bounty hunter, turning on their district for a terrorist? Give me a break, sergeant."**


[6/11/2023 11:59 PM] Sgt. Heather Bailey
**"I wished they went ahead and just bombed Haven Heights."** Heather would pick up a datapad. **"Now not only do we have a rogue bounty hunter. But we have surviving members of Horizon Grey."**


[6/11/2023 11:59 PM] Lt. John Hilton
**"...Members? So you're telling me there is more than just Paige here in District 9?"**


[6/12/2023 12:01 AM] Sgt. Heather Bailey
**"Quite a few. Did some digging around and found one who abandoned the organization for a while now. Goes by the name of Kode. Paid him a visit the day of the ambush. Captain's orders."**


[6/12/2023 12:01 AM] Lt. John Hilton
**"Where is he now? You killed him, right?"**

[6/12/2023 12:08 AM] Sgt. Heather Bailey
**"Freddie Dawson, one of their best engineers before the whole Kilo incident. Has a daughter Grace Dawson who has followed in his footsteps.

Cat entered into the den in which Digit calls home. It's business however was more on the light side with a few patrons a the bar and only three tables out of the dozens holding any customers. On the far end of the den was Digit who was looking at a data-pad within his left hand and smoking what could be decerned as a hookah in his right. It's dim lighting and subtle music gave it a more chill atmosphere. 

Nico was nowhere to be found in the immediate area. Perhaps he was in the back somewhere?


[12/8/2024 7:44 PM] Cat Bayes
*Phew, it's been a long night for the netrunner! Not gonna lie, she was still pretty shaken up about the information she gathered at the facility, but it wasn't like she could do anything about it at the moment. For now, she just needed to get the money and...probably get her ass out of there as fast as possible.*

*Spotting Digi across the room, she took a deep breath and brushed herself off, making her way over to the fixer with a non-chalant vibe.* **"Heeey, Digi! Slow biz tonight choom?"**

Digit glanced up from the datapad and while setting the computer down, a slight smirk played on his lips. He's content with seeing Cat. **"You got that right. The grid lockdown of Littleton makes it hard for good payin' customers to spend their Micros. CCR is watching everything and everyone moving in and out the area and it making people skittish..."** His smile faltered slightly, time to get down to biz. **"Paige isn't with you?"** What did Paige have anything to do with the gig?


[12/9/2024 12:31 AM] Cat Bayes
**"Ah, you know good ole' Paige, being the people's hero and whatnot."** *She shrugged with a witty remark, leaning her shoulder against the booth. So far so good, just gotta keep up your charming personality, get paid, and get gone.* **"Besides, it's not like she can babysit me on all the gigs I'm in...speaking of which, you should be the proud owner of some sweet, sweet data from those pricks who ditched you."**


[12/9/2024 12:34 AM] Digit
**"So I've heard from Nico, nicely done. Paige was here not too long ago asking for some wheels. Was in a rush to get somewhere and thought you might have ran into trouble. 'pose I was wrong about that."** He'd raise his free hand and swipe left. **"Got some good deetz from the upload. More than we could've wrote up. Thrown in a sizable bonus for ya too."**

**17,500** micros were wired into Cat's Micro's wallet.


[12/9/2024 12:55 AM] Cat Bayes
*Cat seemed like she was about to respond before her throat suddenly locked up at the sight of that paycheck. Holy shit, was her bonus an extra zero thrown in there?! She might never get used to these kinda cashouts, but she as sure shit wasn't gonna turn it down!* **"U-Uh...Yeah, no prob choomba..."** *Gulp...*


[12/9/2024 1:13 AM] Digit
**"Keep this up and we might need to poach you. From now on, Nico or I will call you directly for any gigs. Got any burning questions?"** He ripped one from the Hookah.


[12/9/2024 1:27 AM] Cat Bayes
**"Uhh...Huh?"** *Understandably, the netrunner was a little distracted. After a second or two of rebooting, she finally managed a response to his query.* **"O-Oh, questions? Naaah, you know how it is with cats and curiosity!~"** *Oh if only he knew the irony behind that...*


[12/9/2024 1:32 AM] Digit
The fixer nodded, sitting back into the booth and exhaled slowly. Allowing the smoke to gently billow  towards the ceiling. **"I see, take it easy and stay safe. Who knows what kind of shit the CCR might pull."**


[12/9/2024 1:45 AM] Cat Bayes
**"Don't worry, I'm nimble enough to keep those buffoons tripping over each other."** *She remarked with a playful wink, giving the fixer's shoulder a friendly nudge before turning towards the exit. Once she leaves the building, she'll give Paige a call.* **"Oh, and look after yourself Digi. Break Pag's heart if anything happened to ya."**


[12/9/2024 5:36 AM] Digit
**"Heh, I'm well taken care of."** Were his last words before he resumed looking at his data pad.


[12/9/2024 12:04 PM] Cat Bayes
*With that out of the way, Cat let out a big sigh of relief as soon as she stepped outside.*

`Hey sis, how'd the gig go?`
Paige sounded pleased to hear back from Cat.


[12/9/2024 12:26 PM] Cat Bayes
**"Relatively smooth, but you know me."**
Despite the argument they had back at the hideout, Cat was also happy to hear from her friend.
**"Hey, found something I need to talk to you and Mathias about, pretty big stuff, you free?"**
*Thankfully, their conversation was being held mentally, but she still couldn't be too careful with what she said.*


[12/9/2024 12:27 PM] Paige
`**"Sorta kinda... What you got?"**` She responded after a small pause.


[12/9/2024 12:28 PM] Cat Bayes
**"Not something I can talk about over call, don't know who's listening."** *She replied after a brief pause, she sounded kinda busy...* **"Need me to come to you?"**

**"Kidding, kidding!~ I'll see you back at our place, call if you need anything, kay?"**


[12/9/2024 12:34 PM] Paige
`"Sure thing! See you soon."` She disconnected first.

[12/9/2024 12:42 PM] Cat Bayes
*Throwing her hood over her blue head, she reached into her pocket and pulled out a small box of cigs, tapping one out before pinching it between her lips. With her cheap replacement lighter, she lit the end of the tobacco stick and inhaled.*

*If what she learned in that last mission was true...then District 9 was sitting in the calm before the shit storm.*

[12/11/2024 7:41 PM] Narration
A short distance away, a cell tower was of interest. The wall that separated the structure from the public was an energy field that stood 30 feet tall. It scorched anything that touched it. To make matters worse, the CCR managed the security of cellular and neural communications. Two guards stood at the gate, armed like special forces. There was no way to get in there without a fight...

Cat and Paige were located on the third floor of a building that was for sale. No occupants, no problems! The window shutters were torn and mangled, providing a clear view of the target. Just far away enough to discreetly observe and do what they needed from a distance. 

Paige was standing by the door to the room they operated in. Wearing the ballistic vest and a kinetic rifle she took from the CCR a while ago. Cat was close to the window...


[12/11/2024 7:41 PM] Paige
**"Last I was buzzed by Kode, we were at Digit's front... I am certain that the network would have been patched in through this tower specifically."** She re-iterated from a past conversation. **"Do you think you could do anything from here?"** Paige Inquired.


[12/11/2024 8:07 PM] Cat Bayes
*Cat's back was against the wall, her head turned towards the window at an angle where she had clear line of sight of the data tower. Her eyes were already flickering  a vibrant orange with lines of data scrolling down her retinas. To any normal person, that cell tower would look like your everyday tower, boring and dull...but for a netrunner, it was like looking at the biggest and brightest christmas tree in the world, with thousands of glowing lines curving out from the top, going off to who knows where. If they weren't on the clock, she'd probably be joking about it with Paige at that moment.*

*The problem Cat was facing at this current moment was how...delicate, the security was on the net in this area. Sure, accessing surface level information was definitely possible, but any further than that and it could cause problems for them.* **"Mmh, the CCR goons aren't making it very easy for me. One misstep and I risk breaking the dam on shit creek."** *She said as her eyes gazed down towards the super guards standing in front of the gate, they shouldn't be a problem as long as the girls remain out of sight, but what could she do in this situation?*


[12/11/2024 8:27 PM] Narration
Information began decompiling before her eyes. Providing her with surface level information regarding the cell-tower. Thousands upon thousands of entries were flashing and scrolling. Goes to show just how many people use these access points in their daily lives. Filtering out the noise and focusing on the request APIs, the output of a blank request spit out an error code.

```ansi
[== Return Data ==]
[[1;31mRequest Denined[0m]     [1;33mError Code: 199X_SST[0m
```

**199X_SST** was a message associated with top-shelf security protocol. Not something that could be pen easily from afar. Even jacking into a terminal directly connected to the tower would be extremely difficult. Diving would be the most effective solution since it would require large amounts of processing power to even begin.  There was a way to bypass it, but it was extremely dangerous. 

She could register her own neural encryption to the tower. However, that means if she was detected, they'll have **all** of her data to backtrack and any counter-net runners would reduce her to a handicap patient at best. Or use another person as a proxy. Hijack their encryption key and run through them. A complex process that was inherently hazardous.

Her options put simply are:
**1.)** Attempt to pen it without encryption key. Detection is highly likely early on. But it will be hard for them to triangulate.

**2.)** Jacking into the terminal directly. Detection is certain, but complete access is a toss-up. Could be easy or hard. Counter net-runners that could detect her could boot her out.

**3.)** Diving to the tower is a long process that could potentially take **days**. 199X_SST is no joke. All the while avoiding any protocols that might detect her for more than 24 hours. Perhaps in her cracking days, counter-net runners would sometimes use data heat to decern the location of the cracker.

**4.)** Use her key and get access: If detected, they'll know who she is, where she is and could easily kill her.

**5.)


[12/11/2024 8:27 PM] Narration
** Use someone else's key: Got to find a host and the end-result of using someone else is most certainly going to be fatal to them. She'd just get ejected from them if that occurs which was safe.


[12/11/2024 8:46 PM] Cat Bayes
**"Jesus H. fucking Christ, 199X_SST?!"** *She hissed under her breath! These shit buckets weren't playing around, whatever option of breaching she had just turned into a game of russian roulette in six different flavors!*

*No...No, take a deep breath Cat. Brute forcing her way into the system might not be a viable option, but that meant she would have to get creative here.*

- `Raw dog it without an encryption key? Too risky with the amount of spec op security they have in the area.`
- `Jacking in was the same deal, except this time she'd literally be in the belly of the beast and they'd catch her almost immediately.`
- `She could try to take a dip in the ice bath, but having to deal with 199X fucking SST, it'd be a long battle of attrition and one she'd lose with her available set ups.`
- `Fuck no, she wasn't using her key`


[12/11/2024 8:48 PM] Cat Bayes
*She seemed to be fuming over her choices in this scenario, her brow furrowed and her fingers pinching her temple...there was one way she could do it, but it was incredibly ballsy.* **"...I have an idea, but it's incredibly fucking stupid."**


[12/11/2024 9:28 PM] Paige
**"I have nothing but bad plans. For once, I am using my head and deferring my glitches to you. What'cha you got?"** She asked.


[12/11/2024 9:41 PM] Cat Bayes
**"Well, their security is tighter than the president's personal fucking condo, but that might work in our favor if we play this right."** *Tapping the side of her forehead, the orange light in her eyes faded back to their normal blue hue as she turned to face her friend.* **"I've seen the network security they're running before, and to say it's not a joke would be the understatement of the century."**

*Cat paused before she continued, tapping her finger against her arm. She seemed to be trying to process how she was going to word her plan to Paige.* **"So...I'm gonna get some help from another netrunner. *Their* netunner."**


[12/11/2024 10:25 PM] Paige
She pushed off the wall, adjusting the rifle so that the barrel pointed towards the ceiling. **"*Their* netrunner? How are you going to convince their digital junkie to help us hack their own network? You got chooms I don't know about?"**


[12/11/2024 10:30 PM] Cat Bayes
**"You could say he won't have a choice in the matter."** *She smirked, tapping her finger against the side of her head as if she were pointing to her brain.* **"Knowing the CCR, they've got allll the fancy toys and gadgets available to them, including those high end netrunner chairs."**

**"Problem with those chairs though, the netrunner sitting in them has *no* clue what's going on in the real world, and even if they did, once I'm in the room it'd be too late to disconnect from the net."** *She was explaining this like they didn't have to actually __get__ to the netrunner first.* **"I'll use them as a host and access the network that way, then the information is just a hop skip and away."**


[12/12/2024 10:39 PM] Paige
Paige tilted her head slightly in deep thought. It made sense, but what she was thinking of was how to accomplish this. **"Annnnnnnd, how do you intend on finding one of these cyber-junkies?"**


[12/14/2024 8:20 PM] Cat Bayes
**"It's simple in how stupidly dangerous it is, actually."** *Cat chuckled under her breath, pivoting her forearm up to point her thumb out the window.* **"I'm gonna give those bored, underpaid netrunners something to do."** *She was referring to...the guards outside! But what exactly was she planning?*

*Wellifyoubefuckingpatientshewasgettingtothat-*

**"I'm gonna turn one of those CCR goonbags into a proxy that sends a signal to the radio tower. Then it's just a matter of waiting and hoping for the deckhead to take the bait, kinda like fishing in those BD's of the good ole days."**


[12/14/2024 8:46 PM] Paige
Paige furrowed her brow, weighing the danger associated with her friend's plan. **"What do you need me to do?"**


[12/14/2024 9:11 PM] Cat Bayes
**"Well unfortunately, these goons are packing some...*above average* grade ICE, which means the moment I start hacking them, they'll know."** *Ah, there's the catch. There really was no easy way of infiltrating a CCR controlled radio tower with two severely under equipped girls. If they wanna do this, they'll have to move fast and precise.*

**"I can short circuit one of them, but you'll have to incapacitate the other...after that, we're on the clock."**


[12/14/2024 9:15 PM] Paige
**"Getting our circuits dirty, got it."** She dropped the foregrip into her waiting palm and shoulder the butt of the stock into her shoulder. **"Wouldn't be the first time I clocked a lawmen and it certainly won't be the last. I'll see what I can't do, sis."** With that, she would raise her arm and close her fist, fist bump required!


[12/14/2024 9:26 PM] Cat Bayes
*And the fist bump shall be had! Cat raised her own to meet with her sis as they bumped, and their friendship points doubled in number!*

**"Alright, to clarify...we need the goons alive, I'll use one of them to set up for the proxy and then hack into the netrunner's system to gain access to the radio tower."** *This was mostly for both of them, Cat wanted to make sure the plan was down stat.* **"Once the plan is in motion, we'll have no time to rest. If shit goes down or something goes wrong, I'll need you to pull me out."**


[12/14/2024 9:32 PM] Paige
**"Null Sweat, lets get close to these guys."** She gestured for Cat to follow her. Now the real fun begins...

The two descended down the stairs and exited the back of the building that opened up into an alleyway. Ensuring the coast was clear, Cat and Paige began to close-in on their targets. A few dozens meters later and an T intersection in the alleyway came up, perfect for them to cut directly towards the radio tower.


[12/14/2024 9:39 PM] Paige
Paige was leading the pair. Once the two were just about to spill out into the road she noticed a familiar humming sound growing ever potent. Knowing what it was, Paige came to a complete stop and held out her arm, signalling to her companion that they needed to stop. In the same motion, Paige ducked behind a dumpster. It would be big enough to obscure her and Cat both. However, Cat had options.


[12/14/2024 9:39 PM] Narration
There was an open door to the back of another building. She could jump into the building to hide from whatever was approaching. Or there was a electrical transformer on the opposite side of the alleyway she could use. This way if she needed to move around a bit more, she would have the space to do so. It was up to Cat to make that split-second choice.


[12/14/2024 10:02 PM] Cat Bayes
*Hey, can't blame a techhead for being biased. Seeing her friend take cover was enough for her brain to kick into high gear, and in that last moment she quickly dashed behind the electrical transformer!*


[12/14/2024 10:06 PM] Narration
A Neural Nomad was scoping out sidewalk. Moving perpendicular to the alleyway where Paige and Cat were taking refuge in. It hovered methodically, its lens resizing and dancing around as it took in its environment.  Then, it came to a stop and turned towards the Alleyway. Bobbling up, down, left, and right as it idled.

Just when it seemed it would not __FUCK OFF__ it turned back in the direction it was heading and resumed its patrol pattern.

[12/14/2024 10:47 PM] Cat Bayes
*Trusting but verifying her words, Cat slowly peeked from around the corner of the transformer. Looking left, and looking right, she finally stepped out into view.* **"Was that a Nomad? The hell's one of those doing in Littleton?"**


[12/14/2024 10:51 PM] Paige
**"Looking for any clues on Horizon Grey no doubt. Funnily enough, I only seen one in Littleton since being here. Nowadays. It feels like we are in Fairview."**She inched closer towards the sidewalk. Peering across the street towards the Radio tower that was now close. **"We can sneak around the back of the tower from here. See any cameras that might tap us?"**

 *Cat didn't respond to her friend for a little bit, her attention seemingly focused on the alleyway the Nomad hovered down. After a minute or two of entertaining a new idea, she looked back over at Paige.* **"Hey, how much attention do you think one of those things would get if they started going apeshit?"**

[12/15/2024 6:43 PM] Paige
Paige considered this for a moment before peering out towards the street. Can't have any more surprises coming about as they conversed. Once she was satisfied that they were still in the clear, she turned her attention back to Cat. A smug look evident on her face. **"I like dumb ideas."**


[12/15/2024 8:53 PM] Cat Bayes
**"I too like dumb ideas, especially when they make the CCR look like fuckin' idiots."** *Cat snickered, sharing the smug look with her friend. Oh this was gonna be good...~*


[12/17/2024 8:45 PM] Paige
Looking out once more towards the direction in which the Nomad buggered off to. She noticed that it's attention was on a fire hydrant. Scanning it for whatever reason. **"I sometimes forget just how dumb those things are..."** Perhaps now was a good time as ever to do some good old Cat hacking.

*With that, she quickly began tearing apart the drone's firewall as she had done many times before, uploading a Daemon that would reboot it's software and bring it under her control! Muwahahaha!*

The little Neural Nomad perked its imaginary head up from the fire hydrant it was so transfixed on. It's firewall was being assaulted!!! It's lens zoomed in and out, pans left and then right as it pitches in those directions. Attempting to identify what was engaging in firewall assault!

The Neural Nomad squealed and smacked into the metal shutters of a closed store, prompting it to spin uncontrollably as it attempted to re-attain balance and equilibrium. The spinning causing the squeal sound to be all that more hilarious. Once it settled, it's lens caught a mere pixel of Cat, but by that time it's firewall was down. There was a built-in security system on the Neural Nomad where if it could not maintain a secure connection (which in this case, it was tampered with). Some internals would shutdown. Including it's feed transmission to wherever HQ was for this little guy. It went dormant, but continued to hover in place.


[12/25/2024 4:06 PM] Cat Bayes
*Well damn, now she almost felt kinda bad for the little guy. Almost. It was still CCR tech, and no amount of mechanical squealing would ever make her pity those fascist shitters.*

*Now that the drone hovered dormant, she'd have an easier time taking control of it's systems. Just change a few lines of code there, reroute some connections here, annnnd...Bingo! She should have complete remote control of the Nomad's motor functions now!* **"Damn, kinda wish I brought some spray paint with me. Would've been fun to leave a calling card for those bozos."**


[12/25/2024 5:20 PM] Narration
The lens projection of the Neural nomad digitalized into Cat's vision. Talk about an out-of-body experience! Those CCR guards were around the bend and some. Suppose it is time for some chaos!

**"Should've bought some on our way here."** Paige chimed in.


[12/25/2024 5:31 PM] Cat Bayes
**"Oof, I'll never get used to this."** *As the feed from the nomad synced with Cat's vision, her face dulled and became expressionless, as if she was..."turned off" for lack of a better word. Her mouth moved like a marionette puppet while her arms went slack, although she still stood upright to some degree.*

*Before she could have her chaos, she needed to make sure the facilities she needed for said chaos were still functional, and what better way to test than to tease her friend a little? After a few seconds of wibbling and wobbling, the Nomad suddenly hovered close to Paige and zoomed in on her face, a highly bitcrushed and digitized version of Cat's voice escaping from it's speakers!*

```fix

[12/25/2024 6:02 PM] Cat Bayes
*The floating nomad started bobbing up and down, as if it was mimicking human laughter! The sound of it's thrusters humming open and closed definitely added to the effect, seems like Cat was satisfied with her little test!*
```fix
"Hey Sis, when the whole world is run by the Net, well...let's just say the city looks like one big, super deadly playground to us."

The Neural Noma-Cat slipped through the alleyway and emerged just across the street from the CCR guards. The droid was a mere 10 yards away, yet the guards remained oblivious. Both guards looked utterly bored, clearly despising their mundane duty. One of them finally noticed the neural nomad and decided to take action.

**"Hey, you there,"** he called out, **"why don't you do another sweep of the area? We can add it to our report and finally grab some lunch."**

*The Noma-Cat paused in it's flight path, sitting there for a few seconds...before sloooowly turning towards the guard that addressed it.*

*It was just floating there, menacingly.*


[12/25/2024 6:53 PM] Narration
**"Eh?"** What the hell was this thing doing? Normally it listens to his command. Not registering his command? That pissed him off. **"Didn't you hear me you little nut bucket? I told you to do another sweep of the damn area!"** He'd say louder. The other guard now paying attention to what was unfolding.


[12/25/2024 6:55 PM] Cat Bayes
*...*

*Click, FLASH! Did it just- Did it just take a picture of the guard? What the fuck was this thing doing?!*


[12/25/2024 6:56 PM] Narration
The picture flash was bright enough to cause the guards to flinch, covering their eyes. That same guard become even more agitated. **"The hell?! What is wrong with this damn thing?"** They were now momentarily blinded.


[12/25/2024 6:59 PM] Cat Bayes
*Alright, now was the perfect time to kick things into high gear! All of a sudden, the drone reeled back and let out a __gut wrenching__ mechanical screech, before absolutely thundercunting itself at full throttle into the poor guard's head!*
```fix

*THONK! It crashed into his helmet, bouncing off on impact and spinning wildly out of control!*


[12/25/2024 7:04 PM] Narration
**"Swear to go-"** The guard was silenced before he could get his sentence off. 
The second guard jumped in surprise and quite frankly, terror. **"Holy shit man!!! Johnson, you good man?!"** The guard rushed to his partner's side, kneeling down before snapping his neck towards the now out of control Neural Nomad. Was it going to go for him next?

The guard looked like he was going to wet himself before initiating flight sequence. **"Shhhhhhiiiiiiit!!! Unit 84!! We got a rogue Neural Nomad that has lost its circuits! We need help no-"** The Neural Nomad connected with the back of the guard's skull. Causing him to lurch forward and face plant into a street lamp. Knocking him unconscious.


[12/25/2024 7:21 PM] Cat Bayes
*The Neural Noma-Cat circled around the unconscious guards in a rather glitchy pattern, often bouncing or spinning in abrupt ways as it scolded the two on the ground!*

**"Unit 84, quit your crying and get back to work..."** Came a muffled voice from the lawman's radio. Must be their superiors. Well that is no good. What they needed was to attract the attention of a netrunner. Suddenly, a disconnection command appeared on Nomad Cat's display. Bingo, just what she needed... `214.235.118.92:2004` was the remote IP that issued the command. It seemed the runner remotely connected was unaware they were spoofing the nomad. They were attempting to software reconnect the neural nomad.


[12/25/2024 8:21 PM] Cat Bayes
*Back where Paige was hiding with the real deal, Cat's mouth suddenly curled into a confident grin.* **"Got'cha ass."** *Her smirking mouth quipped, before she finally disconnected from the drone!*

*They can have the Nomad for all she cared, she got what she was after. Waking up in meat space, she immediately booted up her cyberdeck and began typing away at the digital interface before her eyes.* **"I got the Netrunner. Once I'm in, I might not have a lot of time before they realize something's up, so be ready to move if things go loud."** *She instructed Paige, before typing in the IP address that had appeared.*


[12/25/2024 8:42 PM] Narration
There is no doubt that the IP address is easily traceable since it uses a standard IPv4 connection. Such barbaric behavior on the part of them! This was a clear indication that the Haven Heights tech was all over the place. Would you be using a 199X_SST protocol while still relying on IPv4 as your transport protocol? There was nothing okay about that. As long as she uses the same port, she should be able to retrieve the encryption token from their server and use it if they had not already finished their upload command and closed the conneciton. Tick tock!

Port: 2004  here we come!


[12/25/2024 8:42 PM] Paige
She moved along the wall, watching one of their flanks before gazing back towards Cat for a moment. **"Got it."**


[12/25/2024 8:49 PM] Cat Bayes
**"Yeesh, shirking out on your security a little bit, arent'cha boys?"** *She spoke to herself, her fingers rapidly tip tapping against the digital interface.* **"Fuckin' amateurs...Lemme show you how a real netrunner runs."**

*With a final tap on the keyboard, Cat established the connection to Port: 2004, and started searching for the encryption token!*


[12/25/2024 8:53 PM] Narration
*Connection Established* They had not closed the connection. Great, and would you look at that. The Encryption key cropped up within the first few seconds!


[12/25/2024 9:15 PM] Cat Bayes
*Perfect, just what she needed! There's a lot she could do in this situation, but given that she was kind of on a time crunch, she'll just have to settle what they came for and delta.*

*With the encryption key in hand, she moved on to request access to the server for the audit log. Normally, she'd have to go through the tedious task of sorting out the entire log for the general data, but thankfully, she had best friend sister gal Paige on deck.*

*With her help, she was able to pull enough of Kode's information to get his user ID. With that, she was able to index the search to narrow things down. Now, she had to look for the most recent traffic from this tower...*


[12/25/2024 9:28 PM] Narration
One entry matched Kode's UserID, showing an outbound call to Paige's ID. She had gotten what she needed. However, her User ID was unencrypted. Was this how they ultimately found Paige? The call log even contained an unencrypted audio file of the conversation. __Anyone with access to review general logs could spy on Paige and anyone she associated with__. These details being unencrypted were not normal. Someone other than the CCR was manually decompiling logs for monitoring. Someone from the inside was sabotaging the very company that provide the services.

Aside from the obvious red flags, the cell tower origin where Kode pinged during the call was traced to Fairview, specifically a CCR police station. The ping was very precise... Weird.

**"What...the fuck?"** *Cat's eyes squinted (even more than usual) at the anomalous data before her. Someone had beaten her to the punch, and had left behind a __very__ obvious trail in their wake.*

*Not only that, but there was no need to triangulate or trace Kode's position with this data, it was just...there. As she suspected, a CCR containment center, which meant it was highly likely he was still alive. Good!*

*Still...None of this sat right with Cat, a dark feeling was beginning to stir within her. She eyed the data for a few moments more before curiosity finally got the better of her. It'll only take a second to check who decrypted those logs, right?* **"Well, good news is, Kode's alive and I've got his deets...bad news is, we're not the only ones who know."**


[12/25/2024 10:10 PM] Paige
She exhaled a sigh of relief, but that last part had her a bit worried. She began moving back into the alleyway, urging Cat to follow. Who knows what they might throw at them now. **" Bad news, explain that to me."**


[12/25/2024 10:15 PM] Cat Bayes
**"Not sure how to explain it just yet, working on that."** *While she worked on tracking down who could've possibly been decrypting that data, she started a download on that audio file on the side. She'll listen to that in the car.*

**"As for the other bad news I *can* explain, Kode's being held in Fairview, local police station."** *She informed her friend, flicking a finger up towards Paige to send her the GPS coordinates.* **"The weird part though...is that I was able to find those deets almost instantly, as if someone else had already gotten it first."**


[12/25/2024 10:23 PM] Paige
**"This doesn't make sense... Unless the CCR hijacked the providers? No, I don't see them doing that. I have a few theories, but nothing concrete.. I don't recall the last time I raided a CCR police station either..."**


[12/25/2024 10:24 PM] Paige
**"The CCR must have forced him to get on the line with me... Like you said, someone got to the data first... Did the CCR accidently 'find' me?"** She was racking her brain for any possible explainations that could make even the faintest of sense.


[12/25/2024 10:28 PM] Cat Bayes
**"We won't know for sure until I finish tracking the user,"** *She responded, her fingers typing away at nothing while she followed Paige.* **"Why wouldn't they cover their tracks...? Are they just stupid, or did they think nobody would go looking for this, or..."**

*Too many thoughts to entertain, each one leading to their own rabbit hole. Fuck it, she needed answers, how was she doing on that user?*


[12/25/2024 10:35 PM] Narration
The infiltrator's User ID was encrypted... Great, so whoever cracked into the system could have cared less about who would have found the data. What mattered to them was that their identity was unknown and cracking IDs was **not** something you'll want to do without deep diving.


[12/25/2024 10:41 PM] Narration
But, by the graces of any god that still exists in this day and age. A single communication transaction with this encrypted key cropped up. A hiccup in their attempt to avoid detection. It was not encrypted but obfuscated. It makes more sense now. They were in a rush just as Cat was but was good enough to throw a wrench in any datamining net runner. Cat should be able to spot this and perhaps reverse it to get an actual ID!


[12/25/2024 10:55 PM] Cat Bayes
**"Fuck me, encrypted!"** *She hissed under her breath. There's no way she'd have the time to crack it now, not without an ice bath or a chair...is what she would've thought, if she hadn't spotted one, tiny, __glaring__ little blemish in their attempt to mask their ID.* **"Wait, hello there...~"**

*Just because you cover up your mistakes doesn't mean they're not there anymore, and Cat had __every__ intention to rip this band-aid off. The young netrunner pulled up this transaction and got to work trying to reverse it, but just how much time would it take?*


[12/25/2024 11:10 PM] Narration
The obfuscation wasn't something she never seen before. A few minutes at best, but once again. The longer she used this connection, the higher the chances she'll get locked out completely when they refresh the certificates.


[12/25/2024 11:10 PM] Paige
**"Found something?"** She asked, opening a sewer lid and pulling it off to the side.


[12/25/2024 11:12 PM] Cat Bayes
*It's a risk she'll have to take, she needs to know what they're up against.* **"Yeah, whoever beat us left me a bread crumb when they were trying to cover up their tracks."** *She turned her attention towards Paige.* **"I'm gonna try to follow it, but I might not be able to use this point again if I'm too slow."**


[12/25/2024 11:14 PM] Paige
**"Will moving from this area mess with your connection?"** She'd ask as she prepped to descend down into the sub network.


[12/25/2024 11:16 PM] Cat Bayes
**"Probably, might be safer to stick around for a few more minutes."** *She eyed the manhole Paige was about to descend.* **"If shit goes down, we'll ditch the connection and delta."**


[12/25/2024 11:21 PM] Paige
**"I'll keep the ladder warm for ya."** She'd descend a bit further. **"Might as well check our escape routes while we wait, eh?"**


[12/25/2024 11:24 PM] Narration
Cat was now racing against the clock.. Any moment and all that work she is going through could be lost. However, nothing is worth it without a gamble. She continued to work on reversing the details. Slowly but surely, characters began to realign themselves. Shifting and locking into their appropriate sequence. Then she got it. UserID: **30223c39225098bv2255zz**

**Disconnected....** The certificaiton expired. They were aware the system was compromised the exact moment she got the UserID.


[12/25/2024 11:32 PM] Cat Bayes
**"Got it!"** *She called out! Losing the connection was a bummer, but hey! She got a __lot__ more than she was bargaining for, and it paid off!*

*Sliding down the ladder, she cocked her head to the side looking for her friend.*


[12/25/2024 11:37 PM] Paige
She wasn't too far ahead, peeking around corners in the dried up underground sewer network. She looked back in time to see Cat. **"Got it?"**


[12/25/2024 11:40 PM] Cat Bayes
**"Got it.~"** *She chimed, clearly proud of herself.* **"Well, not before they booted me out of their system, probably deserved that one, yeah?"**

*Jogging over to her friend, she pat her on the shoulder before stepping past her.* **"So what now? Head to Fairview?"**


[12/25/2024 11:49 PM] Paige
**"Yeah... If Kode is in trouble, then I'm going where he is. He's invaluable. But breaking into a CCR police station is going to be a nightmare, that much I can assure you."** She continued to briskly walk through the sewers. **"Getting cross the border is already going to be a problem..."**


[12/25/2024 11:55 PM] Cat Bayes
*Cat followed alongside her, sifting through databases to see if she couldn't figure out who this elusive user was.* **"How do you wanna play this? Wanna call up Mathias and Boyfriend, see if they can't help?"**


[12/25/2024 11:58 PM] Paige
**"We might need too."** She'd grumble. **"Doing this during the day is suicide if I have learned anything from the 'old man'. And will you stop calling him boyfriend? It's like you're trying to indoctrinate me into thinkin' that."** She'd lightly jest. **"We'll need Cole since he knows how to get through the border undetected. If we can convince Mathias, I'd be surprised..."**


[12/26/2024 12:05 AM] Cat Bayes
**"Oh no, boyfriend's not going away *anytime* soon, waaay better than fuckin' *GhostGaze*."** *She teased back, rolling her eyes with a silly little smirk.* **"But I guess I can call him *Cole* every now and then."**

*She was just giving her sister a hard time, as little sisters do. But all jokes aside, it's gonna take some serious planning, a smidge of luck and a dream to pull this off.* **"You think Mathias wouldn't wanna save Kode?"**

**"It's difficult getting the guy out of the __house__ as it is... Besides, he would be more worried about losing anyone else. In the mind of a Mathias, Kode might already be lost to him."** Her pace slowed down, sighing as she played back what she said in her mind. Paige could see why she would think that. After all, it was realistic. **"Can't hurt to try though."**


[12/26/2024 9:30 PM] Cat Bayes
*After everything Mathias has told her, about Horizon Grey and his own past, as well as the events that had led up to now...Cat was honestly not all that surprised at Paige's diagnoses. To say the dude's had it rough would be the understatement of the century, and at this point, it's safe to assume that he just wants to make sure what little of his family he has left is kept safe.*

*But in that same regard, Kode is still a member of his family. Maybe he doesn't realize - or doesn't want to realize - but he'd probably feel a lot more relief than he'd think getting him to safety.* **"Agreed, should we ring them up?"** *She nodded to Paige, her orange glowing eyes flickering with lines of code.*


[12/26/2024 11:02 PM] Paige
**"Soon, there is something I want to scope out first."**


[12/26/2024 11:03 PM] Paige
A few bends and a turn later, Paige was now climbing back towards the surface. She hasn't said much about *where* they were going exactly.


[1/3/2025 6:40 PM] Cat Bayes
*Well, not like Cat would have any reason to object. For now, she followed closely beside her friend until they came across another ladder. With Paige climbing up first, the netrunner followed shortly after until she was pulling herself up back onto the surface.*


[1/3/2025 7:19 PM] Narration
Where Cat was pulling herself out at was an underground parking garage. Loud music bumped above their heads. This was some sort of establishment one would immediately think to themselves. A bar, a club? No, what clubs have underground parking. Ah, the only logical reasoning would be that this is Digit's spot, just underground. Surrounding Cat were a series of parked vehicles in the dimly lit space. Void of human presence but filled with these cars! Paige was already making her way towards the stairwell that one could only assume would lead to Digit.


[1/3/2025 7:19 PM] Paige
**"Got to talk to Digit for a bit... I owe him quite a bit for allowing me to borrow his wheels last night and I won't be able to keep doing what I do until I repay him a little."** Paige said as she continued walking, strafing as she did so as a way to look towards her 'sis'. **"You could see what Nico is up to in the meantime, yeah?"**

*Oh hey, she knew this place! Well, not the parking lot, but she recognized the building from the few times she's been to this locale. Looking around for Paige, she spotted her just as she was making her way up the steps.* **"Oh, yeah! Can do, sis."**

*Climbing fully out of the manhole, she brushed herself off before making her way over to the steps and up into the building proper.*

The two made it up to where the venue was being hosted. Business was still as scarce as it was last time, but with the change in mood (being the music) it was less depressing!


[1/3/2025 7:51 PM] Digit
D was sitting in that same booth he always sit in. One arm draped over the back of it as he immediately made eye contact with Paige and then soon after Cat.


[1/3/2025 7:51 PM] Paige
Paige walked over towards Digit with a half-smile. **"Hey D... Thanks again for letting me borrow a set of wheels last night."**


[1/3/2025 7:51 PM] Digit
**"Sure. Anything for the Paige. You're here rather early, out free roaming"**


[1/3/2025 7:51 PM] Paige
**"Not exactly free roaming, but getting around, certainly."** She looked over her shoulder to see where Cat was currently.


[1/3/2025 7:57 PM] Cat Bayes
*Cat was currently at the door where Paige had entered from. Before she went off to find Nico however, she noticed her friend and gave her a little wave.*


[1/3/2025 8:17 PM] Paige
Thumbs up! Then, her attention went back towards Digit. **"So,"**


[1/3/2025 8:17 PM] Narration
Cat went into the back rooms of the establishment and entered the room where Nico's setup resides.


[1/3/2025 8:17 PM] Nico
Nico was just unjacking from a large server network he had setup in the spare room. Wiping the sweat off his brow. His back was turned to the blue-haired girl. **"Phew.."**


[1/3/2025 8:20 PM] Cat Bayes
**"Busy as a bee?"** *Cat piped up, her arms folded over one another as she leans against the door frame.*


[1/3/2025 8:22 PM] Nico
Nico glanced over his shoulder towards the sound of a familiar voice... **"Ah, devushka."** He pushed back on his rolling chair and twisted just enough where he could face her directly. **"What brings you by?"**


[1/3/2025 8:24 PM] Cat Bayes
**"Ah y'know, I was in town and wanted to pay my best netrunner choom a visit."** *Cat chuckled as she made her way in, finding a chair across from Nico and sitting with her front facing it's back.* **"Nah, helping Pags out with a job, decided to stop here on the way back."**


[1/3/2025 8:32 PM] Nico
**"There is no shame in that. Make yourself at home, I was just anayalzing the files you sent me a little while ago. Tracing down our parcels have been more difficult than I anticipated unfortunately..."** He turned back towards the server and was now surfing the interfaces manually with a keyboard and mouse. **"Been in the net for long enough to give me a migraine."**


[1/3/2025 8:48 PM] Cat Bayes
**"Ugh, I know how that feels."** *Cat groaned as she recalled the last time she was in this room. Leaning over on the chair, she looks over at the interface he was using - at a bad angle to be able to read it - but curious all the same.* **"Think you'll need help sifting through the data? Might be easier with two people."**


[1/3/2025 8:55 PM] Nico
**"Thanks, but I got it... It is not so much as de-encrypting the data as it is piecing it all together. The distributor was just sloppy with their record keeping. A few filtering algorithms should set it to a straight vector."** A few clicks between GUI's and a prompt came up, compiling data.

**"They had some super old hardware too. So old that most of the deets cannot be seen with any of my devices. Aside from that. It's a cake walk. While you were there, did you find anything else that would be of interest?"**

HEY NOW


[1/4/2025 3:11 PM] Cat Bayes
**"Ahh, not much besides what you'd normally find."** *Cat shrugged, waving her hand about.* **"Just the boring deets you'd rather not hear about."**

*Sorry Nico, you seem like a good guy and all but...Cat can't really trust him with this information just yet, she barely knows him. Besides, what if he __doesn't__ know about the super clones and tells Digi? What if that gets him in trouble? For now, she just needs to keep it between her and the other members of Horizon Grey...speaking of which, she never did get a chance to tell them, huh?*


[1/4/2025 3:14 PM] Nico
**"Null sweat, devushka. A company like that wouldn't have much to offer anyways."** He continued hacking away at his terminal. **"Never asked but always wondered, what part of Haven Heights you from?"** He asked without looking back.

[1/4/2025 4:15 PM] Cat Bayes
**"Oh, well..."** *Cat seemed to cringe a little before rubbing the back of her head, breathing out a sigh.* **"I ran a small, corner Vid Shop in the middle of butt-fuck nowhere - where I was living, too."** *She explained, not really looking at Nico as she hugged the back of the chair.*

**"Had my netrunning set-up in the basement: ice bath, server racks, monitors, work bench, the whole nine yards."** *Cat paused for a moment, her gaze treading down to the floor.* **"Then some rich, corpo fucktard came and burned it to the ground when I *accidentally* stole some BD of his "top secret" and "hella classified" research project. *Aho!*"** (Asshole)


[1/4/2025 4:26 PM] Nico
**"Shit... That's scrapped..."** He returned his attention towards Cat. A moment of silence before he continued. **"Sorry to hear that."**


[1/4/2025 4:44 PM] Cat Bayes
**"Mmh.."** *The young netrunner grunted, going quiet for a few minutes before shrugging.* **"It's why I joined up with Paige and Horizon Grey, so I can get back at that shit grinning piece of fuckery."** *She said, finally looking over towards Nico.* **"Twelve people, he killed twelve people. I don't even know their names."**


[1/4/2025 4:56 PM] Nico
**"Do you know the shithead's name at least?"** He would twist the chair back and fourth.

[1/4/2025 5:02 PM] Cat Bayes
**"Wish I asked before he knocked me out."** *She shook her head, resting her chin on the top of the chair's back.* **"He was blonde, had a chiseled chin...I think there were cybernetics in his arms? Oh, and I'm pretty sure he was a higher up from Bio-Tek, that's where I got the BD from."**


[1/4/2025 5:05 PM] Nico
**"Hmm, can't say I know many Bio-Tek corpo."** Crossing his arms, he sighed. **"Any cameras on that block that could've seen your store at the time?"**


[1/4/2025 5:22 PM] Cat Bayes
**"Haven't really gone back and checked the scene after I joined up with Horizon Grey, it's kinda just been one thing after another."** *But now that she thought about it...* **"Maybe after this gig, I'll start looking into it a bit more...I think I've been avoiding it, honestly."**


[1/4/2025 5:23 PM] Nico
**"Gig? Another fixer got you on a new job?"** He asked, last he check, Digit didn't run any new gig by him.


[1/4/2025 5:24 PM] Cat Bayes
**"Ah, nah."** *She shook her head.* **"Something for Paige, on the personal side of things."**


[1/4/2025 5:40 PM] Nico
**"Loud and clear."** He swung back to the terminal. **"If you need anything, you know where to find us. We are after all friends of Paige and Digit really has taken a liking to you. He and I wouldn't mind helping you out with your little situation if need be.**


[1/4/2025 6:07 PM] Cat Bayes
**"Heh, roger that."** *With a chuckle, she got up from the chair and moved beside Nico, offering him a fist bump.* **"I'll leave ya to it, hit me up if you need some data cracking."**


[1/4/2025 6:12 PM] Narration
Fist bump complete!


[1/4/2025 6:12 PM] Nico
**"You'll be the first to know, devushka."**


[1/4/2025 6:12 PM] Cat Bayes
*With that, she gave him a wave before turning and pocketing her hands, leaving the room to find Paige.*


[1/4/2025 6:19 PM] Narration
Paige and Digit were still in that booth. Sharing the same side as the two were watching something on digit's data pad.

[1/4/2025 6:22 PM] Cat Bayes
*Huh, maybe it was details on a new gig? Shrugging it off, she casually wandered near the booth, just about in Paige's peripheral vision.*


[1/4/2025 6:25 PM] Paige
She glanced up and waved Cat over. **"D here apparently has a scope on our little problem."**


[1/4/2025 6:25 PM] Digit
**"Mmhmmn."** He would then lower the datapad and spin it with his thumb and index finger until the length of it stopped at the web of his hand. This way Cat would grab it from him without smudging the optical glass.


[1/4/2025 6:28 PM] Cat Bayes
*Hey, smudges on your screen are fucking annoying to deal with. Carefully taking the datapad as to not get her sweaty netrunner fingers all over that clean glass, she tilted her head down and gave it a once over.*


[1/4/2025 6:34 PM] Digit
**"Data miners from a year ago got their hands on the layout of the CCR facility you're looking at cracking. Nico came across it and nabbed it before they took it down the next hour and the leakers days later."**


[1/4/2025 6:34 PM] Narration
It showed a 3D holographic orbiting shot of the facility.


[1/4/2025 6:34 PM] Digit
**"Since Nico is nosey as can be, he analyzed the prints. Found a single vulnerability at the vehicle maintaince depot."**


[1/4/2025 6:34 PM] Narration
The garage attached to the facility would flash yellow on the data pad.


[1/4/2025 6:34 PM] Digit
**"All Ion Enforcers are RFID'd to open those garage doors upon arrival. Window tint are reactive and scramble data scrapers. So you won't know who is inside at any given time. Same with the checkpoint between Kapea and Fairview."**


[1/4/2025 6:34 PM] Paige
**"Meaning, if we get our hands on a Ion Enforcer. We can get inside Fairview and the station without issue."**


[1/4/2025 6:34 PM] Digit
**"Given that they don't do an inspection at the checkpoint."**


[1/4/2025 6:34 PM] Paige
**"If that happens, we need someone they don't know to be the driver... That's were you could come in Cat. Fake Identity and everything. Get our hands on some uniforms and that *should* fool them."**


[1/4/2025 6:55 PM] Cat Bayes
**"Easy as that, huh?"** *Cat slid into the booth adjacent from Digi and Paige as she studied the data-pad. The plan __sounded__ feasible on paper, but when the CCR was involved, anything could happen.* **"Fake identity should be easy enough, and with all the recent chaos in Fairview, calling ourselves new drivers would be feasible."**


[1/4/2025 7:08 PM] Paige
**"Need to get our hands on one uniform and an Ion Enforcer though..."**


[1/4/2025 7:18 PM] Digit
**"Sounds like you'll need some muscle to wrestle one from the CCR. Unfortuantely, I have none to spare."**


[1/4/2025 7:19 PM] Paige
**"Me and Cat can handle that part. Thanks for everything Digit."** She stood up from the booth and slipped out.


[1/4/2025 7:19 PM] Digit
**"Of course.."**


[1/4/2025 7:22 PM] Cat Bayes
*Taking one last look at the datapad, she finally placed it back on the table and spun it for Digi like he did earlier. Slipping out of the booth, she gave him a quick peace sign.* **"You're nova, choom. Thanks for the deets."**


[1/4/2025 7:23 PM] Paige
**"So, know any spots where we can fancy ourselves a new fit and a 7 ton set of wheels?"**


[1/4/2025 7:23 PM] Paige
Asking Cat who was on her right as they made for the stairs.


[1/4/2025 7:27 PM] Cat Bayes
**"Nope, but I bet it won't take me long to find some."** *She replied as she joined her friend, giving her a knowing grin.*


[1/4/2025 7:30 PM] Paige
**"You think we could find another patrol and flash our pretty eyes?"** She asked as they began descending down the stairs.

Kaedues made it to the meeting point within 25 minutes. The building was abandoned. Used to be a old media workshop that had several floors to shop from. Now, it was a building filled with empty shelves and dusty corners. Nothing of use was left aside from the building, able to be used as shelter against the most acidic of acid rain storms.


[1/27/2025 9:08 PM] Kaedues Staub
*Kaedues pulls to an efficient stop in front of the abandoned workshop and steps out of the van. He locks the door and walks into the building itself. In the time left he has to wait, Kaedues finds himself taking in the scenery. He's climbed this place front and back, up and down. Feels good to have, well, beaten it?*


[1/27/2025 9:08 PM] Kaedues Staub
*Regardless, he's only here to wait for someone else.*


[1/27/2025 9:14 PM] Narration
Roughly 20 minutes elapsed. The sound of distant footsteps seemed endless. Since the building was near a busy intersection. It could be common place for Kaedues to believe that someone was approaching but they decrease in volume as they continued on their way. 

Then, there was a set of steps that stood out above the rest. The sound of broken glass being stepped on. They moved slowly, methodically even. Though, they were out of sight. Kaedues would be able to deduced that they entered through the back door that was well, missing.


[1/27/2025 9:16 PM] Kaedues Staub
*Kaedues had happened to enter the building from the front door, which is most natural for him. He listens to the footsteps and watches for who would show themselves.*


[1/27/2025 9:20 PM] Narration
The figure emerged from behind the wall seperating the front of the store and the employee area.


[1/27/2025 9:20 PM] Sophie Donovan
It was Sophie, Danny's eldest daughter! She regarded Kaedues silently for a moment before continuing to approach him. **"..."**


[1/27/2025 9:26 PM] Kaedues Staub
**"Good, it's you."** *Kaedues states.* **"You're one of Danny's daughters. What happened?"** *Kaedues asks, straight to the point. He knows little about Sophie, but he does know she did not particularly trust him when they met. That's enough to know something worrying has gone on.*


[1/27/2025 9:31 PM] Sophie Donovan
She stopped roughly 5 meters away from him. Not wanting to get too close to him. Not yet at least. When she stopped, glass crunched underneath her shoe. **"I should be asking you that question."**


[1/27/2025 9:37 PM] Kaedues Staub
*Kaedues turns his head a sure 30 degrees to the right and squints at the young woman.*
*(She __should__ be asking me that question? That means from her perspective, I could know more about Danny's condition than she does. That doesn't align with what he told me. If I come clean with all I know right now though, she might just bounce.)*

**"...How'd you get here?"**


[1/27/2025 9:41 PM] Sophie Donovan
**"I convinced someone to help me across the divide."** Her head sunk slightly into her scarf. Keeping her eyes trained on the red-hair man in front of her.


[1/27/2025 9:42 PM] Sophie Donovan
Perhaps that was a visual display of discomfort.


[1/27/2025 9:44 PM] Kaedues Staub
**"And do you have a way back?"** *He follows up punctually.*


[1/27/2025 9:48 PM] Sophie Donovan
**"I did not ask to meet you so that you could ask about my well-being."** She sounded defensive from these questions. Though, the 'terse' in her voice immediately subsided as she proceeded to speak,  **"My dad is missing. Has been missing for a while now, and I figured you would have some answers as to why..."**


[1/27/2025 9:50 PM] Kaedues Staub
**"If I did have answers, I'd give them to someone who answers my questions."** *Kaedues says bluntly.*


[1/27/2025 9:50 PM] Kaedues Staub
*His eyes track onto hers. They are characteristically cold.*


[1/27/2025 9:53 PM] Sophie Donovan
**"Hmph."** She'd huff, her head turned to the side slightly and her eyes adverted. Pure teenager energy.


[1/27/2025 9:56 PM] Sophie Donovan
**"No, I don't have a way back for now. I will manage."** She would answer his question, almost forcefully.


[1/27/2025 9:59 PM] Kaedues Staub
**"Your mother and sister. Are they still in the same living arrangement?"** *He follows up again. Is this going somewhere? Why does he want to know any of this? Also, wasn't __she__ supposed to be the one grilling __him__?*


[1/27/2025 10:02 PM] Sophie Donovan
Her eyes narrowed, not out of anger though. Her voice softened, barely audiable. **"If you know anything, then please, just tell me. If not, I will just find out on my own."**


[1/27/2025 10:06 PM] Kaedues Staub
*Kaedues takes a deep breath in and out.* **"I know more than you do, but the situation you are trying to set me up into.. it isn't one that makes telling you a good idea."** *Kaedues runs a hand through his head of hair.*


[1/27/2025 10:08 PM] Kaedues Staub
**"You're desperate. I know you are desperate, because you came here. You met up with me. I know enough about your temperament already to know you do not want to trust me. If I did tell you, you would leave immediately and try to do something with the information."**


[1/27/2025 10:11 PM] Kaedues Staub
**"This isn't something that you can get over with."** *He concludes. Now to wait for her to say anything.*


[1/27/2025 10:13 PM] Sophie Donovan
**"You suggest I do nothing, then?"** She asked incredulously.


[1/27/2025 10:17 PM] Kaedues Staub
**"I never said that,"** *He says plainly. Is he alluding to something?*


[1/27/2025 10:20 PM] Sophie Donovan
**"Then, what is it you expect me to do?!"** She'd shout in frustration. **"I am the __only__ one remotely capable of doing __anything.__ If you won't help me, then just say that!"** Her hands came out of her jacket pockets and she swung one arm horizontally as to make a point.


[1/27/2025 10:30 PM] Kaedues Staub
*Kaedues pauses for a few moments to think. He considers Sophie's words carefully. What does he __expect__ from her.. She's the __only__ capable person..*

**"I don't expect something from you. In your situation, I would be just as lost."** *Kaedues blinks and shifts his weight uncomfortably.* **"There's no one out there that will tell you exactly what it is you need to get done to fix your problem. I can't do it. If Danny were __here__ he probably would not be able to tell you how."**


[1/27/2025 10:32 PM] Kaedues Staub
**"If anything, I prefer to see the guy again. Telling you everything I know could be a good idea, or it could not. Hard to tell when you won't come within arm's length."**

*His eyes glide down to the floor. They pan slowly from Sophie's feet to his own, and then back to hers, and finally rest again on her face.*


[1/27/2025 10:40 PM] Sophie Donovan
**"..."** She opted to remain silent for a while. Her eyes lowering before she reached in the inside of her jacket, precuring a case with a zipper on it. In fact, the case was familiar. Danny had it in Shop 1113.


[1/27/2025 10:41 PM] Sophie Donovan
She would unzip it and begin flipping through them.


[1/27/2025 10:46 PM] Sophie Donovan
**"He has gotten involved with bad people. I know that much."** She revealed to Kaedues. **"Narrowing down the list of people to suspect was my ultimate goal."**


[1/27/2025 10:51 PM] Kaedues Staub
**"I need you to answer my questions if you want answers to the more important questions. How are your mother and sister?"**


[1/27/2025 10:52 PM] Sophie Donovan
**"I don't know. Have not seen either of them in days. First it was my Dad... Then my sister... Mom."** She finished flipping and went to remove a shard from one of the sleeves.


[1/27/2025 10:54 PM] Sophie Donovan
**"I am next."** She stated confidently.


[1/27/2025 11:03 PM] Kaedues Staub
*Kaedues rolls his head along his clavicle, ultimately cocking it off to one side as he considers what she said.*

**"Sure seems like it."** *He cosigns with a nod.* **"You came to Haven Heights to try and throw off the people that are trying to find you?"**


[1/27/2025 11:06 PM] Sophie Donovan
**"You would be right. All the criminals come here to dodge law enforcement."** She inspected the shard in her hand.


[1/27/2025 11:20 PM] Kaedues Staub
*Kaedues breathes out.*
**"The dangerous people Danny's involved with right now.. are with the Regency."**


[1/27/2025 11:22 PM] Kaedues Staub
**"If you wanted to help somehow, it would be very difficult to do without quickly being caught. I'm sure you get that."**


[1/27/2025 11:24 PM] Sophie Donovan
Her eyes widened slightly, but only a little bit. Showing interest in the reveleation. **"I didn't think it was the Regency of all things..."**


[1/27/2025 11:25 PM] Sophie Donovan
**"That complicates things more than I originally thought."** She would put the shard back into the binder and stow it away. **"Ugh, why can't I just have a normal life for once?"** She'd complain to no one in particular.


[1/27/2025 11:28 PM] Kaedues Staub
*He rolls his tongue around in his mouth uncomfortably.*
**"You're going to manage, you said?"** *Kaedues asks.* **"Did you plan on selling those shards?"**


[1/27/2025 11:31 PM] Sophie Donovan
**"No, these are priceless."** She responded to Kaedues. **"They are better on me than sitting in my dad's workshop, waiting for someone to take years of his work. I could perhaps use them if it came down to it."**


[1/27/2025 11:36 PM] Kaedues Staub
*Kaedues takes a step forward towards Sophie.* **"Hard to imagine one of those will protect you without any upgrades."** *His eyebrows raise.* **"Whether you like it or not, they actually do have a price. If you don't want the next street thug to take it from you, you'll need to actually keep it somewhere."**


[1/28/2025 6:16 PM] Sophie Donovan
Sophie took a step back, her muscles tensing and her brow furrowing. To her, this was an act of aggression. **"I‚Äôd prefer that you keep your distance,"** she warned him. Sophie had plenty of space to maneuver if necessary, with her hands resting at her sides.


[1/28/2025 7:09 PM] Kaedues Staub
*He completes his step, but doesn't walk any further forward.* **"I know."** *He exhales, and speaks as he does.* **"I'll be very straight with you. If you want me to cooperate with you at all, the distance won't work."** *Kaedues takes a moment to look around him, at the walls and stairs and such. He makes it obvious enough to Sophie that he's, well, looking around.* **"At least twice a week, for the last few years of my life, I have come to this spot. I like to climb this building for fun."**


[1/28/2025 7:16 PM] Kaedues Staub
**"Eventually I did it so many times that the conventional way got old. I learned to crawl up the walls. I know which bricks are loose, where the footholds are, how much weight the light fixtures can hold before they fall."** *He continues.* **"What I'm trying to say is.."**

**"If I wanted to do something with you, the opportunity already presented itself. If you ran right now, there is no place in this building I could not reach you from."** *Kaedues releases an exhasperate groan.* **"What's my end goal?"** *He asks her.*


[1/28/2025 7:28 PM] Sophie Donovan
**"I don't know what it is...."** She replied. When he looked around, she did not let him out of sight for a moment. Her guard is up!


[1/28/2025 7:42 PM] Kaedues Staub
**"If you want to make a dent in the head of whoever is involved with what is happening to your father, you ought to be able to answer that question."** *Kaedues points forward. His dark voids peer into Sophie's eyes. They are calculative and cold, and the space between them almost make it look like Kaedues is seeing through the girl.*


[1/28/2025 7:45 PM] Sophie Donovan
**"You're a creep."** Is all she said. Perhaps she feels stuck as to why she had not made a move yet.


[1/28/2025 7:47 PM] Kaedues Staub
**"Give me your best guess."**


[1/28/2025 7:49 PM] Kaedues Staub
*The off-hand comment doesn't seem to phase him at all.. which may actually contribute to the creepy vibe he's giving off. His eyes continue to bore holes into Sophie's head.*


[1/28/2025 7:53 PM] Sophie Donovan
**"Assuming you were his friend in all of this. You would want to help. He did after all help you."** She thought out loud. **"That is only cemented by the fact I sought you out."**


[1/28/2025 8:00 PM] Kaedues Staub
**"If that's true, then that means my end goal is your end goal. You don't fully believe it though, so the next step is to try and prove it wrong. In other words, you need to probe me. Ask me a loaded question. The easiest ones to use in this situation are yes and no questions."** *Kaedues' eyelids lower a little. His expression relaxes.*


[1/28/2025 8:12 PM] Sophie Donovan
Sophie is sharp enough to recognize that Kaedues is leading her into a mental exercise, but the intensity of his gaze and the detached way he speaks might put her on edge. She came here for answers, not a game of psychological chess. However, she‚Äôs also aware that reacting too emotionally might give Kaedues more leverage over the conversation.

**"Alright then."** Her eyes narrow slightly. **"Did you know this would happen to him before I even called?"**


[1/28/2025 8:15 PM] Kaedues Staub
**"Good choice. I actually can't say yes __or__ no to your question. I knew he had plans to take his family and leave the district before you called."** *He answers. This time, he opts not to keep leading her. He hopes she has a follow-up question, or comes to a conclusion.*


[1/28/2025 8:24 PM] Sophie Donovan
Sophie‚Äôs stomach twisted as she processed Kaedues‚Äô words. He had known. Before she ever reached out, he had known her father was planning to leave before any of this spiraled out of control.

`"It must have been someone flatling him and taking the rest of us out before he could make good on that."`

Her jaw tightened. There was something Kaedues wasn‚Äôt saying. If he had that information, did others? How deep did this go?

**"If you __knew__, why are you here and not rotting in your grave? If you were close, would you have done something to prevent this, no?"**


[1/28/2025 8:28 PM] Kaedues Staub
**"It's for the same reason you should not be taking action right now. It is above my pay grade."** *He states.* **"I do not have the facilities to help your father. I don't know where he is, or his plans. I thought very carefully about whether or not I would follow him and decided that I should stay here."** *Kaedues breathes in, and with the air in his lungs his expression twists in a sour manner.*

**"What you have told me does not fit the __narrative__ I know. The last thing I heard from Danny was that he would keep in touch. When I called, he didn't return it. He hasn't called me back since then, either."**


[1/28/2025 8:32 PM] Kaedues Staub
**"The events I learned from you imply that, if I assumed he did take his family and leave, that would mean Dan chose to take your mother before you. I do not think that is something your father would do, and I don't think it is something your mother would let happen."** *Kaedues crosses his arms. His brows scrunch together, indicating his concentration.* **"There would be no way for me to find out what happened to him. __Until you showed up."__**


[1/28/2025 8:40 PM] Sophie Donovan
**"...."** She listened to him thoughtfully. **"Thanks for your assistance, " ** she said before shifting her body slowly to the right and beginning her transition toward walking back to where she came from.


[1/28/2025 8:45 PM] Kaedues Staub
*Kaedues brings his hand to the bridge of his nose and pinches it with his index finger and thumb.* **"When the people who are coming for you eventually find you, do you want no one to know?"** *He asks. Kaedues times the question to where it comes out just as she turns around.*


[1/28/2025 8:51 PM] Sophie Donovan
She came to a stop and glanced over her shoulder. **"I don't want to drag anyone else into this. So, yes, I would much rather be forgotten than to exasperate the issue for others."**


[1/28/2025 8:52 PM] Kaedues Staub
**"Your logic makes sense. One problem, though."**


[1/28/2025 8:53 PM] Sophie Donovan
Her weight shifted back towards the foot nearest to Kaedues. Signalling her interest in what left he has to say.


[1/28/2025 8:56 PM] Kaedues Staub
**"If Danny finds out I let this happen, I'm mince meat."** *Kaedues reaches into his pocket while he speaks. He calmly takes out a packet of gum.*
*His thumb pushes one of the strips up from the pack like a cigarette might be primed. The patterned wrapper is methodically peeled off of the plank of gum in such a way that it isn't even ripped.*

**"So, basically.."** *He tosses the gum into his mouth and begins to chew.* **"Means you wanna do it the hard way."**

**"...."** She stared at him for a good half a minute before taking a deep breath in...


[1/28/2025 9:03 PM] Sophie Donovan·ûµ
...before slowly exhaling. Opening her eyes. He was going to prevent her from leaving, was that it?


[1/28/2025 9:04 PM] Sophie Donovan
After another moment of silence, Sophie would fish in her jacket pocket, pulling out a hair tie and raising both of her arms. She began to sweep her hair back.


[1/28/2025 9:05 PM] Sophie Donovan
She now shifted back to face him. Watching him with her gaze.


[1/28/2025 9:06 PM] Kaedues Staub
*Kaedues tilts his head to one side. The sound of his neck cracking reverberates through the entire first floor of the building.*

*..and then to the other side. Another pop that breaks the silence. During this time, he untrains his eyes from her.*

[1/28/2025 9:09 PM] Sophie Donovan
She completed her immediate task of putting her hair up in a ponytail. She then pulled upon her scarf and allowed it to unravel and fall to the ground.


[1/28/2025 9:12 PM] Sophie Donovan
Then, she began to take her jacket off, not before grabbing the binder out of the inside of it. She was wearing a tank top and jeans. On the zipper of the binder was a small clamp, which she clipped onto one of the belt loops. What the hell was she planning?


[1/28/2025 9:15 PM] Kaedues Staub
*Kaedues continues to wait. Is his decision to wait indicative of something? Is he reluctant to go through with his implied threat, or is he unsure of what her plans are?*

*His eyes are trained on Sophie now, well trained. Those dark circles housed within his eyes appear glued to her position, from Sophie's perspective.*


[1/28/2025 9:17 PM] Sophie Donovan
She'd then twist on her heel and bolt where she came from! It's a chase, if he so commited to it!


[1/28/2025 9:23 PM] Kaedues Staub
*Kaedues takes a few steps forward. His brisk walk shifts into a jog, which he would use to follow her out of the building. This manageable speed will let him turn on a dime. He suspects she'll turn in either direction when she leaves...*


[1/28/2025 9:28 PM] Sophie Donovan
Kaedues could see Sophie's back. She was finishing her climb and jumped over a chain-link fence around the back, landing on a stack of pallets before hopping down the alleyway. She covered pretty decent distance already. She pressed her hand behind her ear, before quickly removing it. `"This thing is too small for my neural deck.."` She thought to herself.

[1/28/2025 9:37 PM] Kaedues Staub
*With a more direct route to Sophie now, Kaedues begins pushing harder off the ground. His jog shifts into a run toward the chain link fence-- no, a full-on sprint. The ground beneath his feet, the air against his face are both stimulus that remind him to regulate his breathing..*

[1/28/2025 9:37 PM] Kaedues Staub
*He makes a short hop into the air as he approaches the chain-link fence Sophie had just scaled. By tucking his legs in, he can more or less kick the ground beneath him to make an explosive jump that clears most of the length of the fence. Instead of hitching himself on the top end of the wall, he performs a speed vault-- swinging his legs over the top of the fence to catapult himself further forward. When he lands, he lands in a sprint.*

*Kaedues keeps his pace, chasing Sophie down the alleyway..*


[1/28/2025 9:45 PM] Sophie Donovan
She didn‚Äôt dare glance behind her, driven by the urgency of the moment. The end of the alley was closing in fast. Ahead loomed a large, weathered dumpster, paired with a vertical metal pipe that ascended toward the roof behind it. The sturdy gutter drain was her opportunity.

She sprang onto the adjacent building wall, her right sneaker finding grip on the rough surface. In one fluid motion, she jumped onto the top of the sprawling dumpster, the metallic clang echoing in the confined space. Using the momentum she'd gained, she crawled up the side of the gutter, her heart racing as she propelled herself upward for a few adrenaline-fueled bear crawls. Finally, she reached out and grasped the cool metal, anchoring herself as if she were a seasoned climber, instinctively knowing how to transition from one move to the next. Now she was ascending up to the roof!


[1/28/2025 9:58 PM] Kaedues Staub
*Kaedues sees the dumpster in front of him, and Sophie climbing up. He has two options. Either make pace with her and drain her stamina, or outpace her. The odds of her retreating to a place he is unfamiliar with grow with each turn, not to mention the risk of being spotted by any lawmen..*

*His choice comes naturally, which is to raise his arms into the air and run directly at the dumpster Sophie leapt off of earlier. He slams his hands onto the lid, pushing himself upward with much strength to essentially jump without using his legs; a monkey vault!*

*The redhead flies upwards, high enough to grab onto a windowsill on the second story! Another push down with his hands allows him to scale the window and use the point he grabbed with his hands as leverage for another jump. He repeats the earlier motion with the building's roof now, making it to the top. He kicks the sheet metal roof the second he finds enough balance to run, and moves to intercept Sophie on her way to the roof (or reach her as she finishes the climb, if she is fast enough).*


[1/28/2025 10:06 PM] Sophie Donovan
She was ALMOST to the top. She glanced up to see Kaedues beating her to the roof. She gasped once she looked up and saw his eyes meet hers. Without a second thought, she shifted her left foot over to the side of the pipe her right one was and launched herself to an adjecent building. Grabbing onto the roof there and hoisting herself up quickly with a roll!


[1/28/2025 10:15 PM] Kaedues Staub
*Having already gained some momentum from the brief trip toward her would-be destination afforded Kaedues the opportunity to leap across the gap between the buildings. He'd land around the time she pulled herself up.*

*He makes an attempt to move in front of Sophie and shove his hands beneath her to pull her off the ground before she can bring herself to her feet.*


[1/28/2025 10:20 PM] Sophie Donovan
: **"?!"** She'd come to a stop with her facing up towards him, her dumbfounded expression was all that was left of her face. **"What the hell?!"** She'd exclaim, pushing away from him and backing away on her elbows.


[1/28/2025 10:25 PM] Kaedues Staub
*Kaedues remains unphased. He grabs Sophie's ankle and pulls, hard enough to close the distance but not fast enough to sweep her off her elbows. He reaches forward and grips her by one shoulder, and his other hand quickly moves to follow suit with the other one.*


[1/28/2025 10:28 PM] Sophie Donovan
**"Ugh! Let go of me!"** She'd protest, shoving his arms away once she was standing. However, she made no further attempts to run away. She had no idea he really was about parkour like that. Even with her cybernetic shard, he outpaced her easily! What was more frustrating; Him putting his hands on her or the fact he just schooled her so effortlessly?


[1/28/2025 10:33 PM] Kaedues Staub
**"Why should I?"** *He smacks her arms away when she retorts. He moves to stand in step with her on her left side, then he loops his right arm around her, placing his hand to her stomach. His left hand grasps the back of her head, and in one motion he lifts her off the ground in a position one might hold a stray dog or cat.*


[1/28/2025 10:39 PM] Sophie Donovan
**"Argh!"** She had nothing else she could say that would convince him otherwise! So, she did what any girl in her position would do. Began kicking and swinging her arms in frustration.


[1/28/2025 10:46 PM] Kaedues Staub
*Kaedues lets out a disgruntled sound from his throat and mutters to himself.*
-# **"Schei√üe.. deshalb rede ich nicht mit Kindern."**
-# **(Shit.. This is why I don't talk to kids.)**

*Kaedues takes a couple slow steps toward the edge of the building.. before jumping off. He catches the pipe Sophie had used to climb up, and slides down its length to cushon his fall.*


[1/28/2025 10:54 PM] Kaedues Staub
*Kaedues walks out of the alleyway he dropped down into and takes the shortest ground path toward the abandoned media workshop building. He doesn't say anything on the way there.*

*Soon enough, Sophie can see Kaedues stop moving when they approach her discarded jacket and scarf. He uses his spare hand to push her lower back in, uprighting her to stand. He lets her go.*

**"..."** She had no words for Kaedues. Even now!


[1/28/2025 11:07 PM] Kaedues Staub
**"Pick them up."** *Kaedues insists. He sounds surprisingly calm?*


[1/28/2025 11:09 PM] Sophie Donovan
**"You might have stopped me now."** Picking up her clothing items. **"But, no matter what you say, it won't keep me from doing what I feel I need to do."**


[1/28/2025 11:09 PM] Sophie Donovan
**"You're just delaying the inevitable."**


[1/28/2025 11:13 PM] Kaedues Staub
*Kaedues pinches the bridge of his nose.* **"Where were we?"** *He asks rhetorically.* **"Was it my idea of how to find your father? Pretty sure."**


[1/28/2025 11:18 PM] Sophie Donovan
**"I would start at his place of employment."** She would just flat out state this, Ignoring Kaedues. **"Not Shop 1113, but where his boss sits comfortably in his palace he calls an office."**


[1/28/2025 11:20 PM] Sophie Donovan
**"Overhearing his meetings, he is pretty close with a Dyle Bucknic."**


[1/28/2025 11:25 PM] Kaedues Staub
**"Seen him. Those corporate guys don't come down here. Actually, I spoke to him."** *Kaedues mentions and looks into the air.*


[1/28/2025 11:27 PM] Kaedues Staub
**"He was more polite than most of the employers and managers I have met, considering his rung on the ladder. That does not say much for someone from corporate, though."** *Kaedues looks down at Sophie.* **"If you overheard conversations with the two of them, what tells you that they are close?"**


[1/28/2025 11:29 PM] Sophie Donovan
**"They spoke regularly, outside of business hours. About subjects outside of business."** She walked past him, looking out the shattered window. There was an overcast. It was about to rain soon. **"He's my number one suspect."**


[1/28/2025 11:31 PM] Sophie Donovan
**"If the authorities are hunting my family. I cannot simply interrogate them. Dyle would be the most informed since corpo and the CCR are pretty much family in themselves."**


[1/28/2025 11:32 PM] Sophie Donovan
**"It was Dyle or you... You were just the safer option."** She then turned back towards Kaedues.


[1/28/2025 11:37 PM] Kaedues Staub
**"Try to reach a point where you can question me before going at them. Do you even have an idea of how to reach Bucknic, or did you just think you'd catch him as he walks out at the end of the day?"**


[1/28/2025 11:51 PM] Sophie Donovan
**"I would use my family name to get close to him."** She replied. **"If he was close to my dad, he would feel compelled to speak with me... Or that is the theory."**


[1/29/2025 12:05 AM] Kaedues Staub
**"You would feel comfortable putting your family name out to anyone in BioTek's offices... but can't risk saying it over the phone."** *Kaedues observes out loud.*

**"What would you suggest?"**


[1/29/2025 12:13 AM] Kaedues Staub
**"It's a risk. Anything would be, and to be frank my idea is exploitive of you."** *Kaedues says and crosses his arms.* **"I say we bring you home. And wait."**

*He lets that settle for a moment.* **"You are a child, so I don't think the people who are after you will send many people."**
*Kaedues looks down to her, judging her reaction to the statement.* **"To look for your father is likely what those people want you to do. If you have to put yourself at risk, do it on your terms. Always. __Always.__"**

*Kaedues gestures to the abandoned building around them.*


[1/29/2025 12:15 AM] Sophie Donovan
**"...hm"** He made a great point. **"I'll take that into consideration."**


[1/29/2025 12:23 AM] Kaedues Staub
**"Going about it alone is a bad idea no matter what you do. We will need to find capable people. In the meantime, you need to learn how to live in Haven Heights."** *He crouches down to eye level with Sophie.*

**"I will teach you how to actually freerun and how to fight. If you would learn, then I would feel comfortable allowing you to move around on your own."** *His eyebrows lower.* **"I have a few friends I can ask to keep an eye out if I do not know where you are."**


[1/29/2025 12:25 AM] Kaedues Staub
*With a breath, he concludes:*
**"Can you agree to that?"**


[1/29/2025 9:47 PM] Sophie Donovan
**"Similarly to before, I don't have much choice."** She faced him fully. **"I must agree."**


[1/29/2025 10:15 PM] Kaedues Staub
*Kaedues lets out a relieved exhale.* **"That makes this a lot simpler for me."** *Kaedues begins to walk toward the front door of the warehouse, gesturing for Sophie to follow him.* **"I have an errand I have to run. We're going to Jansville."**

*Sophie's first look at Kaedues' vehicle of circumstance may feed the creeper allegations. This thing looks like it's seen better years, and like it could be housing at least a handful of people in the loading bay.*

*He retrieves his keys from his pockets..*


[1/29/2025 10:51 PM] Sophie Donovan
Sophie hesitated as she approached the van, her footsteps slow and deliberate. A swirl of uncertainty gripped her heart; was she genuinely ready to take this leap?

A moment of thought was all she gave herself before she committed, completely. She was now on the passenger side.


[1/29/2025 11:03 PM] Kaedues Staub
*Kaedues unlocks the driver-side door and climbs in. He pulls Grace's glasses out of his pockets, resting tthem on the passenger-side dashboard. In the same motion, he reaches over completely to unlock the passenger side door and even pop it open for Sophie.*

*As Sophie enters the van, he turns the keys in the ignition and checks the loading bay. On his way back to 10 and 2, he happens to look at Sophie. A thought occurs to him..*

**"Are you particular about where or how you sleep?"**


[1/30/2025 7:38 PM] Sophie Donovan
**"I have insomnia."** She would declare, settling in the seat with her gaze locked on the front windshield. **"As long I am not sleeping on the floor, I won't have much room to complain. This is Haven Heights."**


[1/30/2025 8:07 PM] Kaedues Staub
*Kaedues removes the flash drive necklace from around his shoulders and plugs it into the van's central control system. A completely random song from his playlist begins playing as he drives toward the edge of Littleton.*

[1/30/2025 8:13 PM] Kaedues Staub
*As he drives forward, Kaedues finds that he has difficulty starting conversation. There is a feeling here welling within him, that he is meant to do something, but it cannot become anything other than a passing thought. His dull eyes jab in Sophie's direction, just long enough for him to notice she is not wearing a seatbelt.*

**"Wear the seatbelt."** *sounds out Kaedues' voice, sounding insistent but not necessarily demanding.*

She would then reach for the seatbelt. **Click.**


[1/30/2025 8:34 PM] Kaedues Staub
*For the next few minutes, the sound of Haven Heights' broken and battered roads drown out most other noise. Screaming and honking in the background is nothing more than ambience behind the playing music. Kaedues checks his mirrors and his speedometer, and sets his eyes back on the trafficked roads for a while.*

*For a moment, Kaedues turns his head slightly and pans his eyes toward Dan's kid. During that brief time, he considers her position and current circumstance. The man's eyelids slip somewhat, like the grip of a mountain climber in over their head.*
**"I wanted to go. With him."** *He says softly, prying the silence open.*


[1/30/2025 8:38 PM] Sophie Donovan
She remained silent, her lips pressed together and her eyes remained transfixed on the road ahead, leaving him with very little to go on. Leaving her stance go unspoken. One could only what she was thinking at this moment of time.


[1/30/2025 8:49 PM] Kaedues Staub
*Kaedues focuses on the road. He has a __bad feeling__ about the current situation that swims around in his head. His fingers grip the steering wheel in a slow and careful wave pattern. He opens his mouth to speak. Somewhere, he knows, there is a phrase or word that can assist this child in recovering somewhat from her inflicted stress.*

*(Say something,) it tells itself. (Say anything. It doesn't matter what. Just say something.)*
*It can't. It can't picture her situation. It can only calculate it. Observe the effects it has on others. Predict what practical details will change.*

*He says nothing, then.*

[2/1/2025 1:58 PM] Narration
Kaedues was approaching a store to fulfill one of his errand tasks. Off of a side road just outside of ID 6 Freeway‚ÄîA one-way street that often has some drugged-out freak driving in the opposite way of travel occasionally. Luckily for them, this wasn't the case at the current time. 

Traffic was fair, with individuals going about their business as usual. A few spots ahead of their destination was an Ion Enforcer II‚Äîdormant with no occupants to steer it away from the area. This indicated that the CCR was still in an operational capacity but must be handling a supporting role to the whole ordeal they found themselves living in.


[2/1/2025 2:09 PM] Kaedues Staub
*Kaedues pulls into the small shopping outlet, and begins to look around for a suitable place to park. He sees one in the distance, a gap between two cars that looks the perfect space for his van to fit.*

*His face turns slightly toward Sophie now, eyes still on the road.* **"Hey,--"** *He begins to say, breath caught in his voice. He cuts himself off though, just breathing out instead of continuing.* **"..Nevermind."**
-# **"Mull it over,"** *he mutters to himself.*

*He points to the shop he planned to buy from.* **"I figured you'd rather have a sleeping bag. If you want, you can go pick one out yourself."**

[2/1/2025 2:15 PM] Sophie Donovan
She refused to regard Kaedues directly. Instead, she unbuckled her seatbelt and opened the passenger door, slipping out and down onto the wet concrete‚Äîclosing the door behind her as she briskly made her way towards the building to seek refugee from the now downpouring rain.


[2/1/2025 2:37 PM] Kaedues Staub
*150 Micros are wired to Sophie as she leaves the van. It's more than enough to buy a long-lasting product.*

*In the mean time, Kaedeus thinks to himself. Maybe it would have been better to just go get her a bag himself. Is allowing her to venture off on her own kind, or is it demeaning? She can choose the color, the brand, a size that fits her, but she has to pick one. Kaedues is reminded of an earlier feeling, almost a week ago now.*

-# *`"Where I go, I bring myself."`*
*(I felt compelled to say that. To take ownership... no, to take control of my actions. Control...)*

*He is reminded of James' stunt all that time ago, and the M25 Leopard demonstration in BioTek's offices; How he felt the same cold feeling that took hold of him only a few minutes ago. Somehow, it feels like days, weeks have passed since he said those things. They have.. no, they __are__ tucking themselves into a deep recess or chasm in his mental space. He feels it.*
*(Why did.. I say that?) The memory of that recent encounter irks him. (I don't know.. I didn't choose to do that. But I understand the feeeling.)*

*Kaedues' eyebrows lift and turn, and his lips part slightly.*
*(I want to.. apologize.)*
-# *`(Apologizing is an ineffective method of handling this situation. I am considered dangerous. There is no reason for her to submit to that conversation.)`*

*Kaedues hears the stray thought among his own, cutting in like a change in the radio station. It upsets him to agree. Regardless of his intentions right now, trying to wind her down is futile. It is absolutely futile. He thinks about this for a little while.*


[2/2/2025 11:14 PM] Narration
Sophie entered the store and remained in the store for a bit. Occassionally, Kaedues could see Sophie moving through the front of the aisles through the windows. 

Spilling out onto the walk-way of the sidewalk were two CCR lawmen exiting a resturant with drinks in their hands. They were heading in Kaedues' direction‚Äîconsidering their vehicle was in that direction. Neither of them seemed to be concerned with their surroundings, hinting to a sense of familiarity with the area. 

Just before they seemed to be making their final approach to their Ion Enforcer, one of them would nudge the other and point towards the store Sophie was current in. The second Lawmen's attention focused on the store as they exchanged a few words between each other before going to enter the store.


[2/2/2025 11:42 PM] Kaedues Staub
*Kaedues watches the officers walk away from the restaurant idly. At the time, he was too engrossed in thought to be disturbed by them. When they nudge one another though, his mind jumps to another endpoint. He sees them approach the store Sophie is in, and by the time he is collected enough to act at all.. he has not much time to think.*

*His hand opens up the car door for him, allowing him to step out and begin walking toward the store as well. The sound of the van's door shutting sings across the street..*


[2/2/2025 11:45 PM] Narration
By the time Kaedues steps out of the van. The two lawmen were already well inside the establishment with Sophie somewhere deeper within the store.


[2/2/2025 11:49 PM] Kaedues Staub
*(They probably aren't here for her.)*
*He thinks to himself. He's too busy focusing his attention toward the store, but even that thought feels strange to him.*

*The sound of the shop door's annoying jingle rings out as Kaedues walks through it. He steps off to the side where possible and waits. He is more or less just listening for now.*


[2/3/2025 5:31 PM] Narration
Kaedues could hear and see the ordinary thrall of business ambiance. Music occupied the background as people went about their shopping. The sound of the law enforcement officers' radios could be heard, accenting the overall tunes here and there.

Kaedues could see Sophie from his current position. She had what appeared to be a sleeping bag in one hand and a plastic bag in another‚Äîfinishing up her immediate shopping needs. 

The lawman who suggested they stop into the store wanted to purchase a new knife from the looks of it. The knives were selected near the checkout aisle, immediately behind Sophie. 

Kaedues could see that Sophie was also aware, but she did well in not looking at them and pretending not to notice them at all. However, with how everything goes in this fucked up world, the lawman tagging along with his knife-wielding companion would begin to make conversation with the teen.

**"Sleeping bag, what a girl like yourself doin' with that?"** He'd inquire, a genuine question that might have extremely dire consequences if managed poorly...


[2/3/2025 5:31 PM] Sophie Donovan
Sophie, feeling the weight of the law enforcement officer's presence behind her, slowly turned her head to face them. A practiced smile touched her lips, yet it failed to ignite the depths of her eyes, which remained distant, betraying a hint of unease. **"Oh.. uhh‚ÄîMy bedroom is... being redone, so I'm finding refuge in my living room."** She would lie; It was the best lie she could come up with so little time to formulate an alibi.


[2/3/2025 5:41 PM] Narration
**"Renovations, eh?"** The engaging lawman would mull over the details she provided. It made sense. He soaked in her appearance, noticing remnants of dirt and grim on her skin and clothes. Nothing was in perfect condition, as expected from a Littleton residence.

**"I wouldn't renovate anything here in Haven Heights. Would instead invest that money to moving to Jansville or Cedar Square."** His partner interjected.


[2/3/2025 5:41 PM] Sophie Donovan
With her transaction finished, she would give them a parting message. **"I'll relay the deets to my family."** With that done, she quickly turned her back towards them and started for the front door. Her eyes locked onto Kaedues the moment she began looking for the door.


[2/3/2025 7:18 PM] Kaedues Staub
*The redhead does well to take into account what Sophie tells them. He conjures up any amount of supporting dialogue to help her story make sense..*
*(I was right not to jump to conclusions. She handled the situation well.)*

*Kaedues' eyes flick to and from Sophie and the lawman as she approaches. Once she gets within a distance Kaedues believes is appropriate for talking, he speaks up just loud enough for him to overhear.*

**"It'll only be a few more days,"** *He says in a reassuring way, like an older brother or the like.* **"then you'll have your room back. It shouldn't have even got to this point."** *His right hand waves her toward the door, and he steps in its way to open it for her.*


[2/3/2025 8:17 PM] Narration
The *one* lawman watched Sophie as she fled the clerk's counter. His eyes traveled beyond Sophie and towards Kaedues, who was standing there. His theatrical could fool any idiot; playing along with the bit she spun up should reinforce the believability.

Sophie continued onward and towards Kaedues' vehicle without delay.


[2/3/2025 8:19 PM] gardengnostic2
whoops lol


[2/3/2025 8:28 PM] Kaedues Staub
*Kaedues fights the urge to look over his shoulder when they move toward his van. The rain is cold and bothersome. His boots splash against the shallow puddles forming in the road. The downpour rolls off of his hair and soaks the top of his jumpsuit.*

*He opens the driver-side door and climbs into the van. He checks the loading bay like he usually does before directing his attention to the passenger seat; Waiting for Sophie to appear.*


[2/3/2025 10:03 PM] Sophie Donovan
Sophie opened the passenger door and climbed in with her purchases in hand. It did not take her long to get all her goods inside the van before closing the door. **"Just my luck."** She muttered to herself, referring to her forced interaction with law enforcement.


[2/3/2025 10:17 PM] Kaedues Staub
*Kaedues pauses for a moment as Sophie arranges herself. His eyes trail from one end of the front seats to the other, and then he looks in her direction. For a moment, he comes up with a number of ways-- the best ways-- to approach the topic he wants to bring up. The formality of these ideas leave a sour taste in Kaedues' mouth, he finds.*

*He finds that as he considers an effective way to bring this up, his eyes are already going over her facial features. Waiting for a change.*

*He brings his right hand to his mouth and gently rubs his lower lip. He turns away from Sophie-- just enough to where he cannot see her anymore.*
**"What do you want to do?"**


[2/3/2025 10:29 PM] Sophie Donovan
Sophie settled in her seat, fastening her seatbelt. Hearing Kaedues question, Sophie kept her response simple, carrying a hint of contempt. **"Find my parents and sister. But, what I want to do is not the best of interest."** Then, her eyes fluttered back towards the lawmen who were now finishing up their own transaction. **"Let's get out of here."**


[2/3/2025 10:56 PM] Kaedues Staub
*Kaedues fires up the ignition and pulls the van onto the road smoothly. Especially right now, Kaedues is making an effort to abide by traffic laws. Once they make a solid enough distance from the Ion Enforcer, Kaedues speaks again. His eyes glue themselves to the road.*

**"I do my work alone,"** *he states. There are intermittent, tiny pauses between the words.* **"I keep an.. order of myself. I don't know why. I have.. to."**
*There's another pause. A frustrated noise spills from the front of Kaedues' mouth.* **"Because.. of that.. I am more or less holding you hostage."**

*His fingers tense slightly, but a collected exhale soothes them back to their gentle grip on the van's steering wheel. The van completes a turn onto one of the larger roads on the way to Kaedues' home. The phrase-- hostage-- invites a familiar memory to mind.*
**"I shouldn't do that. I just can't-- ..not know, anymore."**


[2/3/2025 11:41 PM] Sophie Donovan
As Kaedues speaks and reveals his thoughts to her, Sophie feels a mix of emotions. At first, she feels a bit frustrated not fully understanding what is going through this guy's head. She's also a bit irritated by the fact that he has been holding her hostage all this time, even if it was for her own safety?

**"..."**

Sophie sits quietly in the van, processing the information that Kaedues has shared with her. She doesn't know what else to do. What to really think.


[2/3/2025 11:56 PM] Kaedues Staub
*Without a response from Sophie, Kaedues just.. shakes his head quietly. His shoulders hang a little. Now, the van steers onto a smaller road. The two of them can feel the speed of the van shift slower, possibly hinting at how close they are.*

*The familiar braking force presses onto the chests of the van's occupants as it arrives at Kaedues' home. Seeing the outside is enough to understand how shitty of a living situation Kaedues has.*
**"This is it,"** *he says, and gets out of the van.*


[2/4/2025 2:06 PM] Sophie Donovan
Sophie's eyes bore into the front of the dilapidated structure. Haven Heights sure was the sector of the impoverished. Once Kaedues exited the van, she took this opportunity to gather her things and exit herself. With a sturdy closing of the passenger door, Sophie followed after him‚Äîthough slower than him. 

Her attention was now elsewhere‚Äîeverywhere but the building before her. The Neighborhood, the people who walked the streets‚Äîsome equally curious or as cautious. Looking, watching. This moment would not last as she finally met Kaedues at the front door.


[2/4/2025 2:14 PM] Kaedues Staub
*While Sophie surveys the area, Kaedues makes his way to the front door and pivots in time to take notice of her spanning attention.*

**"It's a bad neighborhood. Break-ins, muggings, kidnappings.. I've been around long enough to hear of them all and see a number of them too. No one really bothers coming in here though, on account of how shitty it looks."**

*Kaedues turns the doorknob and opens the door. The sound of the knob turning gives away that its mechanism is missing-- it sounds hollow.*
**"If I were you, I would not keep your shards in this house. The van is more or less the only safe spot I can think of. If you don't like that, we can come up with a third option."**


[2/4/2025 2:18 PM] Sophie Donovan
**"They stay with me,"** Sophie responds firmly, her voice anchored as her gaze settles upon him. **"I don't trust anyone or anything else with them."** Unless his third option is for her to be around them 24/7, one may guess she'll refuse it.


[2/4/2025 2:20 PM] Kaedues Staub
**"That's smart, but it won't work when you sleep,"** *Kaedues comments.*


[2/4/2025 2:21 PM] Sophie Donovan
**"I'll take my chances."**


[2/4/2025 2:37 PM] Kaedues Staub
*Kaedues looks directly at her for a moment. His eyes begin to scan her again, trying to figure out a dialogue path that will get her to relent. He looks away, at the back wall.*

*Now, Kaedues takes a breath in.*
*(I doubt she believes she'll be safe in the house. Why bother taking something that valuable with you.. everywhere.. you go..)*
*Kaedues' head cranes down. He pulls the flash drive attached to his necklace up to his face to take a look at it.*

*After a pause, Kaedues looks back toward Sophie, at her feet, or arms. His eyes would glue to somewhere, anywhere except her head.*
*(If I do that, I am almost certain she'll dip.)*


[2/4/2025 2:44 PM] Kaedues Staub
*He breathes out and lets go of his necklace. Now, he turns toward her.* **"We'll come back to that."** *He declares, and moves into the house. The redhead walks calmly toward his kitchen, boots creaking the boards underneath his feet as he moves.*

**"Before you learn to fight with your hands, you should fight with a knife."** *He reaches upward and opens a cupboard to retrieve his silverware rack. He takes a butter knife out from the tray and returns the rest to the cupboard. Now, he turns to face Sophie again.* **"This is for you,"** *he says. With a snap of the wrist, he flips the knife and catches its blade so the handle faces toward Sophie.* **"I'll give you one of mine when we're done."**


[2/4/2025 9:29 PM] Sophie Donovan
Sophie‚Äôs hands were still clutching her things when he presented the knife to her. After looking at the butter knife for a few seconds, she put her things down and set up towards him. Slowly, as if in a trance, she reached out her hand to take the knife from him. Her fingers wrapped around it gingerly at first, but as she felt its weight and the coolness of the metal against her skin, her grip tightened. She lifted it up to eye level, examining it. Then, her knife arm came down and her eyes went up to meet his once more.


[2/4/2025 9:41 PM] Kaedues Staub
**"In Haven Heights, you might get jumped by any number or kind of person. Men and women alike. As far as striking power goes, you are already at a disadvantage because you are both young and female."** *Kaedues explains. His tone is plain.*

*Now, Kaedues unzips his jumpsuit down to his waist. He pulls his arms out from the sleeves and, by tying the sleeves around his waist, allows the suit to hang around his hips. His torso is more clearly visible now. His undershirt is not nearly as baggy as his jumpsuit.*
**"The knife is good against all of these people. Your striking power stops becoming important with one of those."**


[2/4/2025 9:45 PM] Kaedues Staub
**"Let me get something clear though. The best way to win a knife fight is not to fight at all. You should run from all of the fights you get into, especially with bladed weapons. In most realistic 'winning' situations with knife fights, you will still be left with possibly fatal injuries."**

*Kaedues points calmly at the butter knife in Sophie's hand.* **"Hold the knife forward toward me, at a distance where you don't feel the strain on your elbows. Your elbows should point slightly out, too."**


[2/4/2025 9:50 PM] Sophie Donovan
Sophie follows Kaedues' instructions and holds the butter knife out in front of her with a grip that doesn't strain her elbow. She looks at him expectantly, waiting for further guidance on how to use the knife in self-defense. *One thing is clear though, she isn't confident in her stance.*


[2/4/2025 9:53 PM] Kaedues Staub
**"Legs apart, just far enough apart to feel the traction of the floor with your shoes. Shift your weight forward a little so you feel it on the balls of your feet instead of the heels."**


[2/4/2025 9:58 PM] Sophie Donovan
It takes her a moment to get it right but with a few uncomfortable shifts here and there. She believes she got it correctly.


[2/4/2025 10:03 PM] Kaedues Staub
*Kaedues reviews her form and nods.* **"That'll work. With your hands in that position, you can do a lot of swings or pokes. Try thrusting it forward, and swiping it toward the outside of your body. Remember to bring yourself back to this stance after both of these."**


[2/4/2025 10:04 PM] Kaedues Staub
**"Oh, and remember to use your elbows as the pivot point for your arms. Your shoulders are too slow. It's a mistake a lot of rookies make, so watch out for that."**


[2/4/2025 10:11 PM] Sophie Donovan
She hesitated; he was asking for her to try to stab him‚ÄîNo, right? Of course not! He just wanted her to demonstrate that she could follow instructions. Keep it slow and follow through with the motions‚Äîand she did just that. He took good care of imagining what he was expecting and attempted to *feel* what he was teaching her. Slowly, Sophie would push the knife forward and pull the knife outwards to the side before returning.


[2/4/2025 10:22 PM] Kaedues Staub
**"Now try another outward slash,"** *Kaedues explains, now taking the stance he taught her.* **"and return the motion with a thrust."** *Kaedues imitates the motion for her.*

**"Just like with your hands, it's easy to miss in real fights. The stance I taught you is good because it blocks your vital organs with your forearms."**
*Kaedues raises his arms up in a mock boxing stance. He makes a point not to actually ball his fists; His fingers dangle in front of his face.* **"I'm going to swing at you. When you see me step forward, step back yourself and swing at my arm."**


[2/4/2025 10:25 PM] Sophie Donovan
She would furrow her brow slightly before nodding.


[2/4/2025 10:27 PM] Kaedues Staub
*With that, Kaedues steps forward on cue. He thrusts his arm forward in a loose punch that would have a hard time leaving a bruise if it really did land.*


[2/4/2025 10:36 PM] Sophie Donovan
The moment he stepped forward, she stepped back as instructed‚Äîthe back of her knife hand came into contact with his wrist pushing it away. She failed to get back into her stance position but corrected this after a moment of thought.


[2/4/2025 10:43 PM] Kaedues Staub
*Kaedues steps back and shakes his head.* **"I appreciate your modesty, but you should cut me. I can shrug off a couple of little nicks from the knife I gave you."** *Kaedues rolls his head around his shoulders to loosen the muscles in his neck.*

**"If you can, strike the inside of the elbow. Anything on the inside of the forearm is best, and of course it's better to hit something than nothing at all."**


[2/4/2025 10:48 PM] Sophie Donovan
**"If you say so..."** She was on standby!


[2/4/2025 10:48 PM] Kaedues Staub
**"Here it comes."**
*Kaedues cues himself in and repeats the same punch he performed before!*


[2/4/2025 10:51 PM] Sophie Donovan
Knowing what to expect, she moved backward and sidestepped to the opposite side from which his arm came. This offset in her positioning allowed her to come down with the blades facing his arm and to push his arm out at the same time. Now, getting back into her original posture with more fluid ease.


[2/4/2025 10:59 PM] Kaedues Staub
*Kaedues steps back reflexively, and his eyes pan down to the place where she knife made contact. A shallow cut formed, just barely enough to break the skin. Beads of off-red blood collect on its surface.*

*His eyes move to Sophie.* **"That was good. You took stance faster than last time, and your step back was to a better spot."**
*Now, Kaedues begins to gently hop from left to right. He doesn't cover much distance in either direction.* **"This time, there won't be a cue, and I won't be committing to any one strike. Watch closely."**

*Without waiting for her to confirm, Kaedues bounces back and forth a few more times before stepping forward! He brings his dominant hand forward as if to punch, but then steps to the side and actually strikes with his left hand in a hook punch!*


[2/4/2025 11:15 PM] Sophie Donovan
Sophie watches as Kaedues dances around, gauging his movements and trying to anticipate where he might strike from. When he suddenly lunges forward with a punch, she instinctively steps back and raises her knife to defend herself, but is caught off guard by the unexpected redirection. 

She manages to avoid the brunt of the blow with a clumsy additional sidestep, but not without getting clipped on her shoulder. The subtle force sends her stumbling backward a few steps. She could've done better, but she kept her stance up. Expecting him to continue on his simulated assault.


[2/4/2025 11:18 PM] Kaedues Staub
**"Every action you make has a risk when you fight. You shouldn't expect yourself to know the best choices to make now. When you choose wrong, coach yourself."** *Kaedues steps in, attempting to subtly guide her toward one of the walls of the home. He delivers another normal punch.*


[2/4/2025 11:23 PM] Sophie Donovan
Sophie nods, understanding that she can't expect to make the right choices every time. She watches as Kaedues steps in, trying to anticipate his next move. When he throws a punch, she quickly reacts by stepping back and raising her knife to redirect it. She is a quickly learner‚Äîgetting into a rhythm with subtle guidance.


[2/4/2025 11:29 PM] Kaedues Staub
*Now, Kaedues steps in and follows up instead of stepping back when he is hit. His non-dominant hand comes in where his dominant hand was deflected, following up with an attack that curves upward from below!*
**"When you coach yourself, don't let your focus stick to your mistakes. Think of what you should have done and aim to do it right where possible."**


[2/9/2025 4:42 PM] Sophie Donovan
The undercut curve was unpredicted. However, she was quick enough to lean back. Again, the sudden backwards motion forced her to backpedal. Almost tripping on her own feet with how quick she was forced to react. 

The amount of space she had available to her quickly diminished as her back came into contact with the wall behind her. Her eyes darted to her side, realizing she was now cornered.


[2/9/2025 5:11 PM] Kaedues Staub
*When her eyes dart to the side, Sophie next sees Kaedues' fist tap the disheveled section of wall behind her.*
**"This, will happen often if you fight indoors. It's better to fight outdoors, or make sure your back is always facing an exit."**

*The fist that made contact with the wall points back to Kaedues himself, where his other hand is pointing to his stomach.*
**"If there are no other options, you have to strike a vital point."**

*Now, the wide-framed man steps back, if only to give the girl some amount of breathing room.*
**"The stomach is __easy__ to cut and will kill, but not quickly enough if you are in a corner."** *Now, he points to his chest.* **"If you can make it past the ribs, you can realistically walk away from the corner."**


[2/9/2025 10:52 PM] Sophie Donovan
**"..."** Sophie laxed her posture and watched Kaedues. She blinked a few times before looking down at the butter knife in her hand. Only a fool would not see the value in the lessons Kaedues was attempting to part upon her. This might be the very lesson she would __need in the future.__ **"I see."**


[2/9/2025 10:52 PM] Narration
There was the sound of something furocious flying overhead at a high rate of speed. As quickly as it came about their ears, it deflated‚Äîbut not before the deafening boom of the sound barrier being torn apart.


[2/9/2025 10:52 PM] Sophie Donovan
The boom prompted Sophie to flinch and look over towards the nearest window would be. Unsure of what to make of what that was...


[2/9/2025 11:34 PM] Kaedues Staub
*Kaedues was in the state of mind to ignore the sound, loud as it was, until the accompanying boom impacts his ears like a hammer! He recoils forward from the sound and holds his hands to his ears for a beat. With a look left and right, he realizes the event is over and moves to the window Sophie was looking out of.*

*(An aircraft..) The thought seems weighted somehow. Not particularly important or unimportant, but.. weird.*

*Now Kaedues turns to face Sophie. She doesn't look like she knows, so he does not ask. It takes only a breath in and out to calm himself, and he approaches the other end of the room.*


[2/9/2025 11:38 PM] Kaedues Staub
**"A pocket knife is practical for your use-case. You will be able to carry it around without anyone knowing you are armed, and it is quick to deploy once you learn the flicking rhythm."**

*He pulls out a drawer and rummages through some old tools and other junk. From the drawer, the redhead produces a pocket knife as he alluded to..*

[2/9/2025 11:55 PM] Kaedues Staub
**"I was attacked only yesterday by a group of gang members,"** *he adds.*

[2/10/2025 12:05 AM] Sophie Donovan
Sophie would take hold of the knife, her attention still locked onto him. **"Gang members? What did they want with you? You don't strike me as a person of interest."**


[2/10/2025 12:07 AM] Kaedues Staub
*Kaedues pauses for a moment to think about how to tell Sophie of the situation.*
**"I was doing a favor for a street vendor. Had to talk them into leaving the block. I wanted to talk, at least."**


[2/10/2025 12:13 AM] Sophie Donovan
She considered this explanation silently before pocketing the knife in her jacket and approaching her purchased things.

**"Do you intend on ever going across the border to finish your biz?"** She asked offhandedly.


[2/10/2025 12:18 AM] Kaedues Staub
**"Yeah,"** *he answers as though he had the response loaded.* **"I could pass through if you are not in the van. Maybe I could either way, but I am not taking that risk."** *Kaedues explains.* **"There could be a way for the two of us, but I doubt you are in the right mind for that."**


[2/10/2025 12:23 AM] Sophie Donovan
**"Mmn, Agreed."** She took another look around the house before sliding down the wall around her things. With a deep sigh, she would go on, **"It is probably not a good idea to go into Fairview anyways. They are requiring everyone who is in Fairview to get some firmware that aligns with government regs. If you want to stay off their radar, you might need to find a different way."** She revealed.


[2/10/2025 12:27 PM] Kaedues Staub
*Kaedues crouches down so that his frame lowers to Sophie's level. His eyes glance at each of her arms.* **"One more thing before we're done. Show me your wrists, please."** *Kaedues asks and props his forearms on his thighs.*


[2/10/2025 3:03 PM] Sophie Donovan
**"...Why?"** She asked, her eyes filled with an unspoken scrutiny. What exactly was this __weirdo__ thinking?


[2/10/2025 4:40 PM] Kaedues Staub
*Kaedues just.. looks at Sophie's face for a second. He appears puzzled, maybe frustrated? But after a moment, he just sighs.* **"I want to teach you something else. How to free your arms if they are held."**

*Now, Kaedues holds his hands out, as if to ask for hers, but he hesitates. He looks to the side for a moment and then back to her. His arms move together where he grasps his own wrist. The hand gripping his wrist is pushed forward to demonstrate to Sophie.*


[2/10/2025 4:44 PM] Kaedues Staub
**"Grab your own wrist, and do as I do."** *Kaedues' fingers clamp around his wrist now, clearly tight enough to hold himself. He pushes his forearm toward his grasping thumb, and with enough force his thumb gives out and allows his hand to slip.*
**"You can break out from a simple grab by yanking your wrist through the thumb. It can't grab things as well as your fingers can."**


[2/10/2025 4:49 PM] Sophie Donovan
Sophie would mimick him, repeating the steps he provided. She found it surprising that it was __that__ easy. **"Oh, that's...easy to do."** She would do it again, out of pure curiosity.


[2/10/2025 5:08 PM] Kaedues Staub
**"I want to keep you around so I know where you are, but I expect that idea to go south quickly."** *Kaedues stands up now. He grabs the dusted sleeves of his jumpsuit and unties them from his waist. He pushes his arms through the sleeves and zips the suit up as if getting ready for the day.*

**"I am going to let you off for now. Like I mentioned earlier, I want you to come back here at night so I can make sure you are healthy."** *Kaedues begins to lean to the left and right, stretching his arms and sides.* **"We need at least three people who are willing to go through with this plan. You'll probably find people who are capable enough here, in the Stacks, but they would sooner rob you than listen."**


[2/10/2025 5:08 PM] Kaedues Staub
**"Littleton is a little safer. If you want to be heard, learn to talk like the people here. Find someone to hang around with and keep it low key."** *The sound of Kaedues' dark boots clocking the aged flooring ripples through the room as he moves to the door.*


[2/10/2025 5:13 PM] Sophie Donovan
**"mmhmm."** She responded with a hum.


[2/10/2025 5:23 PM] Kaedues Staub
**"If you need something, you can call the number you called earlier."** *Kaedues momentarily rests his back on the doorframe and looks in Sophie's direction.* **"Also.. If you don't want to be called Sophie in public you should come up with a different name."**


[2/10/2025 5:31 PM] Sophie Donovan
**"I will probably come up with something."** Sophie shuffled her feet so that she was now facing Kaedues once more.


[2/10/2025 5:37 PM] Kaedues Staub
*(I want to pitch a name.. but I can't think of anything. I feel like I should give a __passing__ name, but there's no way to know for sure if a name will make sense until it's put out there.)*

*Kaedues turns and approaches his van.* **"Most people down here respond well to money. I can see about handling that if you can vouch for their good will."** *With that, he opens up the driver-side door and gives one last look back toward the home.*


[2/10/2025 5:55 PM] Sophie Donovan
Sophie could be seen peering out of the window through the blinds, barely if one was not paying attention to the window.


[2/10/2025 6:02 PM] Kaedues Staub
*Without another word, Kaedues enters his van and starts the engine. Within just a few moments, that van pulls out of the inlet outside his home, leaving Sophie to her own devices.*

*Kaedues himself was headed to a place relatively near-- the entrance to the Metro he learned of yesterday. He'd park the a couple blocks down and walk the rest of the way to the spot. On the way in, he gives a friendly enough nod to the street vendor that guards the entrance.*

[3/3/2025 8:16 PM] Narration
Kaedues stepped into the elevator and watched the doors slide shut, the faint hum of machinery kicking in as it began its ascent. Using Nico‚Äôs location as his guide, he selected the second floor. As the elevator climbed, the music from the establishment swelled‚Äîa chaotic yet mesmerizing synth-heavy beat, teetering on the edge of collapse with its off-beat groove, yet somehow holding together in perfect disarray.

## DING! ##

The doors slid open, and a thick cloud of smoke rolled into the elevator, carrying the scent of spice and something electric. The music was now deafening, wrapping around him in pulsing waves. The scene before him starkly contrasted the Metro‚Äôs grim hushed and muted tones‚Äîthis place was alive, drenched in neon and revelry. Laughter and conversation clashed against the music while hookah stations dotted the space, exhaling slow plumes of vapor into the air.

Scantily clad servers wove through the crowd, balancing trays of drinks and food, their cybernetic enhancements glinting under the shifting lights. The crowd was lost in indulgence, immersed in the rhythm of the music. Near the elevator, two men exchanged a glance at Kaedues, sizing him up briefly before deciding he wasn‚Äôt worth their attention.


[3/3/2025 8:30 PM] Kaedues Staub
*With the bright light, surrounding music, and the tingling smell in the air, Kaedues cannot help but feel just a little overwhelmed. He steps forward on autopilot toward the bar in the room. He finds himself maneuvering around the servers.. Looking at everyone, he gets another strange feeling. He doesn't know how to describe it, but it feels.. tight? Heavy, maybe?*

*(Just find him. That's all I need to do, and hopefully I can leave with a gig.)*
*He approaches the bar, looking for a bartender if there is one.*


[3/3/2025 9:20 PM] Narration
No bartender was in sight at either end of the counter. But as if subconsciously knowing someone was looking for them. The bartender popped up from underneath the counter with a shaker, mixing some unknown cocktail.


[3/3/2025 9:20 PM] Vel
**"Oh.... You're a new face. There has been a lot of you coming around lately."** Her name was a mystery... Or, was it since the wall behind her said, `Current Bartender: Vel` **"What can I get you? We have a special on a few of our drinks, Citrix, a shot of Keligu, some Bruduma Hard Seltzer, maybe?"** She just continued to shake the shaker as she regarded the man.


[3/3/2025 9:26 PM] Kaedues Staub
*Kaedues closes his eyes and thinks to himself for a moment. The drive here wasn't particularly difficult, and he's not feeling strange from the glass earlier.*
*Then his eyes open and quickly direct themselves toward Vel.* **"A short glass of any lager, if you have it."** *He speaks plain and simple, like always.*


[3/3/2025 9:33 PM] Vel
**"Lager... That's how I know you're from the south-side of the Heights."** The edge of her mouth curled upwards. She skillfully procured a glass and finished the cocktail she was prepared. She would then slide it down the length of the counter, and a patron caught it with practiced ease before downing it. **"HEY! Slow down you fucking deadbolt, I didn't do all that for you to just down it! I don't care how badly you got cucked."** She'd bark at the man who quickly corrected his actions. After the lecture, she went on to fetch the bottle of Lager. **"One second."** She said to Kaedues, walking down the length of the bar.


[3/3/2025 9:39 PM] Kaedues Staub
*Kaedues finds himself watching the glass slide down the bar. Actually, that stands out to him. There's a lot to be said about her experience if she's able to send a glass flying down the bar without it falling off. That, or she's just got a shard plugged in.*

**"Thanks."** *Kaedues reaches up to his neck with his right hand. He gives it a rub after feeling a strange tightening sensation around his neck, and finds that the texture has changed. As quickly as he notices, it goes away. What is that?*


[3/3/2025 9:46 PM] Vel
Vel plucked the bottle off of the shelf on the far side of the bar and returned to Kaedues, taking a short glass and pour his drink for him, sliding it within arms reach. **"Here you are, let me know if it isn't strong enough. I have my way with acquiring that extra __kick__."**

üëÖ

[3/3/2025 9:55 PM] Kaedues Staub
**"Do you know anyone here called Digit?"** *Kaedues asks as he wraps his fingers around the glass. When he brings it to his lips, he waits a spell to smell it-- he had not planned to, but in the moment it felt right. Not a bad smell either, Kaedues finds, as he takes a sip.*


[3/3/2025 10:02 PM] Vel
She gave him a chuckle that came from her core. Her purple lipstick-stained lips haven't faltered for even a moment. **"So that's why you're here."** She remarked after getting the immediate amusement out of her system, though the playful intonation in her voice persisted. **"Maybe I do, maybe I don't?"**


[3/3/2025 10:03 PM] Vel
She tilted her head slightly, exposing more of the nape of her neck as she thoroughly inspected Kaedues. Her bangs now out of the way of both of her eyes.


[3/3/2025 10:13 PM] Kaedues Staub
*Kaedues' eyes move down to her neck for a moment, and he moves his head a fraction of an inch to make sure he saw what he did. His earlier sentiments are reinforced; she doesn't have a shard plugged in.*

*Of course, his gaze doesn't linger anywhere. He looks her in the eyes. Briefly, he appears to look through her.. and then at her again. His resting frown shifts to more of a neutral expression.*
**"How does this usually play out?"** *He asks plainly.*


[3/3/2025 10:16 PM] Vel
**"Haha, you're sooooooo cute."** She commented, leaning against the counter with her chin in the palm of her hand. **"First time for everything, I suppose...."** She let the remark linger in the air for a while. **"Well, to tell you simply. I am the last line of defense for anyone who is askin' for my boss, but don't know a byte of data on him. Why are you worried about Digit, hmm?"**


[3/3/2025 10:25 PM] Kaedues Staub
*Kaedues nods horizontally, acknowledging her and her position.*
**"Right, I understand."** *The redhead takes another sip of the lager. He continues to speak, his expression unchanging.* **"Wouldn't use the word 'worried'. Heard of him only today, heard he'd throw together some jobs for me if I told him what I do."**

*Kaedues presses his lips together thoughtfully as he continues to observe this woman and debate in his head whether or not he should let any more slip.* **"I need money as much as the next guy, but more than that I need to meet people."**


[3/3/2025 10:29 PM] Vel
**"Persuasive and compelling claim. I would go so far as to sa-"** Her eyes removed themselves from Kaedues to something beyond him. **"..."**


[3/3/2025 10:33 PM] Kaedues Staub
*Kaedues looks at her for another moment. He steps out of the bar stool and turns around to look at whatever Vel had directed her attention to.*


[3/3/2025 10:36 PM] Digit
A man was sitting at a booth all by himself with a hookah in his hand. Blowing smoke lazily as he locked eyes with Vel.


[3/3/2025 10:36 PM] Vel
**"Guess you lucked out."** She remarked, stepping back from the counter and dealing with another customer. **"That's your guy."**

[3/3/2025 10:46 PM] Kaedues Staub
**"Nice."**
*Kaedues gives Vel a nod as he leaves to go see the guy. He brings his drink.* **"Nice to know he wasn't lying when he talked about you."** *He tries to strike the conversation like that.*


[3/3/2025 10:54 PM] Digit
**"I don't recall a time Nico ever lied to me."** He would take another drag from the pen, allowing the smoke to roll out of his nostrils. **"He said you were the man lookin' for some work."**


[3/3/2025 11:07 PM] Kaedues Staub
**"That's me,"** *Kaedues confirms. He sits down across from Digit now.*


[3/3/2025 11:18 PM] Digit
**"Whatcha got in terms of skills?"** He would drape his pen arm across the booth back rest.


[3/3/2025 11:29 PM] Kaedues Staub
**"To be honest, it is easier to show you than tell you, but I will tell anyway.."** *Kaedues crosses his arms at the booth and begins to list off his capabilities..*
**"I have operated in basically every blue collar job you can think of. I can do plumbing, mechanic work, HVAC.."** *He raises fingers as he goes through them, but stops halfway when he realizes these attributes may not really be what he is asking for.* **"..I can lift a lot, move quickly, and I am good at talking to people. In the practical sense,"** *He clarifies for that last bit.*


[3/4/2025 12:00 AM] Digit
**"What a guy like you doing in the Metro?"** Digit was intrigued why such an unassuming guy with such ordinary skills was looking for work from a fixer.


[3/4/2025 12:09 AM] Kaedues Staub
**"To put it simply, I am trying to put myself in a position where I can find a few people. Got a job of my own I want to get done."** *Kaedues lays his cards out on the table so to speak, albeit holding back some of the important details.*
**"Making money on the side isn't so bad either."**


[3/4/2025 8:06 PM] Digit
**"You're looking for people."** He stated in his own way. **"What are you looking for?"** He would bring the pen back to his lips. But, before hitting it, he would continue on. **"I could throw any man on any job, I do it all the time. But that approach is inefficient for someone like you."** Now, he would take a drag.


[3/4/2025 8:18 PM] Kaedues Staub
*Kaedues sighs. This question Digit is asking is both a gold mine and a trojan horse. He'd be giving one person more information than he should by answering, but the way he phrases the question implies he may be willing to help, assuming it does not come at an increased cost.*

*For a moment, Kaedues says nothing. He looks into Digit's eyes, comparing the man's body language to the way he returns the red-haired man's look.*
**"..Putting it short, I am looking for hired arms. Need the kind of people who will organize and co-operate with one another and with me."**


[3/4/2025 8:24 PM] Digit
Digit exhaled slowly as his head lazily tilted towards the ceiling. **"So they are still forming worker unions these days?"** The remark wasn't towards Kaedues exactly. His eyes lowered so that he could see Kaedues. **"Ever held a gun before?"**


[3/4/2025 8:26 PM] Kaedues Staub
**"Held, sure. Never fired one, though."**


[3/4/2025 8:33 PM] Digit
**"Sorry choom, but I don't thin‚Äî"**


[3/4/2025 8:33 PM] Narration
**"Let go of me!"** Whoever was shouting was clear enough to be heard over the choatic backdrop of the enviroment.


[3/4/2025 8:33 PM] Digit
Digit's eyes shifted to the left where the source of the shouting came from.


[3/4/2025 8:34 PM] Kaedues Staub
*Kaedues turns to look, as well.*


[3/4/2025 8:37 PM] Sophie Donovan
Sophie snatched her arm away from the security guard who was trying to prevent her from entering the bar club. Using what she learned from Kaedues, she pulled her arm away at the thumb, coming free immediately. She was giving them a run for their money, because the moment she got free, she delivered a sneaker to the testicales. Collasping the man.

[3/4/2025 8:44 PM] Kaedues Staub
*Kaedues' eyebrows raise at the sight of Sophie entering the bar. He happens to see it all, the escape from the grab and the kick to the guard's nuts.* **"Oh."**

**"This one's mine to handle. I'll be back,"** *Kaedues declares before rising from his seat at the booth and approaching Sophie.* **"What are you doing here?"** *He asks. His tone doesn't really imply that she isn't supposed to be here.. he is likely just confused, or curious.*


[3/4/2025 8:47 PM] Sophie Donovan
She backed away from the guy she took down and looked over towards Kaedues, almost unphased by what she just did to that bouncer. **"Looking for you."**


[3/4/2025 8:48 PM] Kaedues Staub
*(Maybe it's just a poor choice of words,) Kaedues thinks. (If not, then she has more tools at her disposal than I thought. I'm far from untraceable, but..)*

**"What do you need?"**


[3/4/2025 8:49 PM] Kaedues Staub
*Kaedues glances down at the bouncer, and then back up to Sophie. It's excessive.. but hey who even knows these people anyway?*


[3/4/2025 8:51 PM] Sophie Donovan
**"I believe I have found a lead."**


[3/4/2025 8:51 PM] Narration
**"Ughhh........"**


[3/4/2025 9:00 PM] Kaedues Staub
*Kaedues takes the time to look over his shoulder at Digit.*
*(I can't maintain a good appearance while telling either party to wait.)*

*Without missing a beat, Kaedues sends his contact info to the fixer.*
**"Don't think I don't know what I'm asking for,"** *He says plainly, and then turns to Sophie.*

*He makes an open-palm gesture to the exit of the bar.* **"If we're going to talk, we should talk outside."**


[3/4/2025 9:01 PM] Sophie Donovan
She nodded her head, stepping over the security guard and into the elevator.


[3/4/2025 9:06 PM] Kaedues Staub
*Kaedues follows suit, stepping over the man. He moves into the elevator and presses the button corresponding to the bottom floor.*
**"That was fast. It was better than some of the street fighters down here,"** *He comments.*


[3/4/2025 9:08 PM] Sophie Donovan
**"Huh?"** She looked over and up towards him. Perhaps she did not hear him, or understand what he was referring too.


[3/4/2025 9:13 PM] Kaedues Staub
**"Up there, you.."** *Kaedues hesitates. Suddenly, he feels nervous about saying something like this. He isn't used to singing people's praises..*
*He's reminded now of someone else, a few people who have sung his own praises, though. It's not a bad thing to be honest.*

*He clears his throat.* **"You freed yourself. I just.. it's a good thing you remembered."** *His tone is plain, as always, but the way he says this feels rushed or hurried..*


[3/4/2025 9:16 PM] Sophie Donovan
**"Oh.."** She looked away.


[3/4/2025 9:16 PM] Narration
And before it could get awkward.

## DING! ##

The elevator doors opened towards the parking garage underneath the bar club.


[3/4/2025 9:20 PM] Kaedues Staub
*Kaedues immediately begins to walk toward his van. He makes no small talk on the way there. Without really instructing her, Kaedues enters the driver seat of his van. He reaches over and pulls the latch to the passenger-side door so she could properly open it herself.*


[3/4/2025 9:21 PM] Sophie Donovan
She climbed in and closed the door. Without looking at him, she asked. **"Did I interupt something?"**


[3/4/2025 9:28 PM] Kaedues Staub
**"Yes, you did,"** *Kaedues confirms.* **"It might have been for the better though."**
*Kaedues shuffles into the seat of the shop van. The seat briefly feels.. worse. He's reminded of the old seats he used to have, how he broke in the driver's seat in a way that never needed to be adjusted.*

*He blinks as the thought is cleared from his head. He regards Sophie more now.* **"You mentioned a lead?"**


[3/4/2025 9:41 PM] Sophie Donovan
**"There is someone else I have my eye on."** She finally turned towards him slightly. Buckling her seatbelt. **"They live in somewhere here in Littleton, but I don't know where. My dad had a 'friend' here somewhere and often talked about visiting them after work sometimes."**

Sophie went on to fix her jacket since it was scrunching up against the seatbelt. **"My dad does not have friends, so it makes me wonder."**


[3/4/2025 9:43 PM] Sophie Donovan
**"I would continue looking for them myself, but those cyborgs are crawling all over the place and I keep getting weird looks from people. I figured if I was with you, it would be easier... And you would be willing to help."** Her gaze went back towards the front windshield as she explained.


[3/4/2025 9:44 PM] Kaedues Staub
*Kaedues nods.* **"Yeah, I'll help. You got a name or address of this person your dad visited after work?"**


[3/4/2025 9:56 PM] Sophie Donovan
**"I have a general idea of where he lives, but nothing concrete... An apartment complex not from here, I can give you directions."**


[3/4/2025 9:58 PM] Kaedues Staub
**"That works somewhat. Sure, let's go. Name, face? Do you know?"** *He asks, turning the keys into the ignition of the van.*


[3/4/2025 10:00 PM] Sophie Donovan
**"Doug is his name, but I don't know what he looks like."**


[3/4/2025 10:03 PM] Kaedues Staub
**"That's a start. Let's go."** *Kaedues gives Sophie a (hopefully) reassuring nod.*


[3/4/2025 10:20 PM] Narration
Sophie gave Kaedues the directions to the apartments that she was referring to. Littleton apartments were signficiantly nicer than those found in other burrows, but that was to be expected. There were 4 floors to the apartment complex Sophie gave instructions towards.


[3/4/2025 10:20 PM] Sophie Donovan
She gazed upon the building they were nearing, looking towards the top floor before taking her seatbelt off and began fishing in her jacket; Procuring the shard binder she kept on her.


[3/4/2025 10:21 PM] Sophie Donovan
Unzipping the zipper to it, she began scowering through the sleeves of shards. Looking for that *right one*.


[3/4/2025 10:23 PM] Kaedues Staub
*With that, Kaedues takes off toward the geo location Sophie provided. The drive should be smooth, as well.*
*As they pull out of the parking garage, Kaedues does look over at Sophie, at the shard binder.*
*(The way she's handling it.. Has she used these before? Before coming here?)*


[3/4/2025 10:30 PM] Sophie Donovan
Her hands stopped suddenly, her eyes taking in what she was looking at before popping one of the shards out of its container. Once it was within her palm, she closed it and zipped the binder back up. Stuffing it back into her jacket.


[3/4/2025 10:35 PM] Kaedues Staub
**"Anything in particular you are planning to use?"** *He asks casually.*


[3/4/2025 10:37 PM] Sophie Donovan
**"They call them defensive protocols... This one in particular creates some sort of energy field around the user... But considering I lack cybernetics, I don't know how useful it will be..."** She opened her palm and looked at the design of the shard. **"I don't know what to expect... I'm nervous."**


[3/4/2025 10:48 PM] Kaedues Staub
**"..Alright."** *It seems like she's overstepping, doing more than she needs to. Kaedues has to force himself not to try and tell her those things. He has no good reason to, other than his own way of doing things.*

*He glances shortly at Sophie.* **"You should be nervous. It's less likely than where I live, but there is no telling what kind of person we are visiting."** *Kaedues sighs. In retrospect, that wasn't reassuring at all.* **"There are steps we can take to mitigate.."** *He trails off.* **"..the.."** *Kaedues shakes his head now, dismissing his statement.* **"I am nervous, too."**


[3/4/2025 11:17 PM] Sophie Donovan
Her eyes migrated towards Kaedues again, but not to his eyes. His chest? his hands? **"..."** It did not last for long as she turned her attention towards movement at the apartment. There was someone at their window, looking around. Taking in the view of the burrow of Littleton. It was a man that piqued her interest, before he retreated from the window, the vertical blinds now taking up the space he once did. 

She would pop the handle of the van and slip down onto the asphalt parking lot.


[3/4/2025 11:24 PM] Kaedues Staub
*Kaedues gives Sophie a look before exiting the van himself. He takes a look at the apartment building himself, finding nothing immediately. He was focused on driving, so he didn't have the option to pay attention to any of the windows.*

**"Right.. We'll have to ask around. Doug, you said."** *Kaedues begins to approach the building.* **"Can you remember any times your father used his name when talking?"**


[3/4/2025 11:28 PM] Sophie Donovan
She came to a stop when he asked the question. With her back towards him, he couldn't see how she reacted. But, she responded nonetheless. **"Yeah... A few times."** She then continued towards the building, walking towards the side of the building where a set out exterior steps would allow anyone to ascend to the upper levels.


[3/4/2025 11:31 PM] Kaedues Staub
*Kaedues slows to a stop to think about how to approach the building, and sees Sophie approaching the steps.* **"His apartment is on an upper level?"**


[3/4/2025 11:31 PM] Sophie Donovan
**"I think so.."** She was already ascending them.


[3/4/2025 11:37 PM] Kaedues Staub
*Kaedues follows after Sophie, then. He ascends the concrete steps leading to the top. The structure holds Kaedues' weight nicely. Metal would too, but concrete is a lot.. quieter.*

*Kaedues slows his pace for a moment and looks down, off of the stairway and at the street below. After a moment's time he speeds up to make pace with Sophie though. He continues to follow her for now.*


[3/4/2025 11:40 PM] Sophie Donovan
She emerges on the fourth floor and once she reached it she froze, looking down the length of it.


[3/4/2025 11:43 PM] Sophie Donovan
She takes an extremely slow breath in. Her nerves were getting to her. One moment, she was eager to get this far but now, hestitation‚Äîno, fear was gripping her. Rooting her in place. The length of the walkway seemed to elongate, a sense of vertigo as her anxiety reached all time highs. What was she so afraid of?


[3/4/2025 11:48 PM] Kaedues Staub
*Kaedues catches up to Sophie now, noticing that she stopped. He doesn't grasp right now that she is afraid.*
*Instead of asking her something, at least right away, he looks where she's looking.. His eyes scan the area habitually, probing for anything.*


[3/4/2025 11:49 PM] Narration
Nothing looked out of the ordinary. Simply just a balcony with apartment room doors on the left.


[3/4/2025 11:58 PM] Kaedues Staub
*Kaedues' eyes glide back to Sophie one more time, making contact for a lingering moment. Then, quickly as they locked on to her, they tilt upwards, detaching themselves. His face twists one way and then another, subtly but still definitely present, as if his features are arguing about what mood to pick. Eventually, Kaedues speaks.*

**"Are you having second thoughts?"** *He asks.*


[3/5/2025 2:35 PM] Sophie Donovan
Sophie lowered her head subtly, swallowing in an effort to moisturize her throat to no avail. Taking a moment to make up her mind, Sophie shook her head in an act of defiance. 
-# **"No."** muttering 
Raising her head leveled with the ground, Sophie continued forward with measured steps. **"Fourth door... I saw a man in the window.. I think that was him."**


[3/5/2025 2:38 PM] Kaedues Staub
*Kaedues directs his attention toward the first door he can find, and then trails his eyes along the line of apartments until he finds the fourth.* **"..What tipped you off?"**


[3/5/2025 2:40 PM] Sophie Donovan
**"...I don't know..."** She passed the first door, then the second.


[3/5/2025 2:48 PM] Kaedues Staub
*Kaedues at first does not follow Sophie. His mouth opens to speak.. and he doesn't.*
*(Why did she say that?) he asks himself. On the surface, it seems pretty cut and dry.. but the fact that this was her idea to begin with contrasts with her statement. At the same time, Kaedues can remember a couple of times where his gut was the only thing that had him solve a problem.*

*He follows her again, and would continue to follow her until they reach the 4th door. There's a strange itching sensation at the back of his head that he instinctually ignores..*


[3/5/2025 3:08 PM] Sophie Donovan
Sophie looked up at the imposing number on the door: *404*. The digits seemed to loom larger than life, and she found herself reading them repeatedly, trying to convince herself that this was, indeed, the right place. The cold, unyielding surface of the metal was a stark reminder of her purpose. With a determined shake of her head, she forced her gaze away from the label, directing her focus toward her closed palm. 

As she slowly opened it, her fingers revealed the jagged shard that caught the reflection of the sun, glinting. The corners of the shard pressed deeply into her skin, leaving indents where her palm had gripped, and her fingers were marked with dark purple impressions‚Äîa testament to her anxiety and the tension she had carried with her. She hadn't fully comprehended how tightly she had held on as if the shard itself was a lifeline.

Deep down, she understood the necessity of what she was about to do. Yet, alarm bells echoed in her mind, warning her against this reckless pursuit. This was uncharted territory; she wasn't supposed to enter these shadows. But desperation tightened its grip on her resolve. What choice did she indeed have? She needed answers that could sever the chains of uncertainty binding her. The truth was the only path to closure; without it, she felt she would be lost forever, wandering in a fog of questions and regrets.

She tilted her head and slotted the shard into her neural port. Her eyes illuminated, and her expression gave the impression of discomfort. This certainly was a taxing shard for her deck; it was almost painful. This, however, did not stop her as she knocked on the door and took a step back. Narrowing her eyes as she awaited the faintest of sounds.


[3/5/2025 3:15 PM] Kaedues Staub
*Kaedues too looks at the door. He does not get the anxious and fearful impressions that Sophie gets, but he does feel something incomprehensible to him. Like a weight on his shoulders, or his stomach. He pats Sophie's nearest shoulder and steps in line with her to watch the door.*
-# **"I'll lead. If he talks with me, watch him."** *Kaedues instructs the girl quietly, but not softly.*


[3/5/2025 3:26 PM] Narration
**"What do you want?"** A muffled masculine voice responded.


[3/5/2025 3:37 PM] Kaedues Staub
*Kaedues pauses for a moment, considering the proper way to approach his answer. Being turned down is very easy in this situation.*
**"Same thing you do."** *He responds boldly.* **"Want to return home and stop worrying about how things are playing out all the time."**

*He feigns an exhasperated sigh. Sophie may be able to discern this, since his face doesn't reflect the sound he makes.* **"Got questions I need answers to."**


[3/5/2025 4:25 PM] Sophie Donovan
She observed Kaedues as he acted to elicit a response from the man on the other side of the door.


[3/5/2025 4:25 PM] Narration
**"Like hell you do, fuck off, will yeh?"** Was the response that Kaedues received in response.


[3/5/2025 4:30 PM] Sophie Donovan
**"I'm looking for my dad."** Sophie chimed in, taking a much more riskier approach. **"...His name is Danny."** She left his last name out of it. She wanted to reveal some truth but not everything with this. **"Are you Doug?"**


[3/5/2025 4:39 PM] Narration
**"..."** A few clicks could be heard through the door before it cracked open. A chain connected to the door frame and door kept it from opening any further. The man's face was partially visible, with ginger hair and blue eyes as he regarded the people at his door. First, it was towards Kaedues. Then, he had to expose more of his face to get an angle on Sophie. At first, the guy's face seeped with suspicion, and when he saw Sophie, there was a slight movement in his brow. 

**"Shit.."** The door slammed close and more shuffling and hasty movement on the inside ensued.


[3/5/2025 4:39 PM] Sophie Donovan
**". . ."** Did he just... shut the door on them like that?


[3/5/2025 4:41 PM] Kaedues Staub
*Kaedues glances down to Sophie, and then back up to the door. His gut tells him to wait a spell, so he does.*


[3/5/2025 4:46 PM] Narration
The door then opened, and the man stood before them, wearing a plain jacket, shirt, and cargo pants.


[3/5/2025 4:46 PM] Doug
**"Get in here. Quick."** The man stepped out of the way. The tone in his voice told them all they needed to know; they needed to get out of the open.


[3/5/2025 4:49 PM] Kaedues Staub
*Kaedues does just that, stepping inside. He looks into Doug's eyes, letting his gaze linger there for just a moment. Next he looks at Sophie, both to prompt her to follow if she had not already entered and to gauge her reaction to the unfolding situation.*


[3/5/2025 5:02 PM] Sophie Donovan
Sophie was relunctant at first, but the urge in Doug's voice was enough to send her through the threshold of the apartment room.


[3/5/2025 5:02 PM] Narration
The scent of gunpowder and burnt metal hit them first. It wasn‚Äôt strong‚Äîmore like a lingering ghost in the air, mixing with the acrid bite of soldered circuits and the stale aroma of cheap liquor.


[3/5/2025 5:02 PM] Sophie Donovan
This prompted Sophie to crinkle her noise as the smell hit her. Metallic is all that she could describe it as. Immediately, she found herself in the living room.


[3/5/2025 5:02 PM] Narration
The living room was dim, saved for the sunlight bleeding through the spaces in the blinds. There was a flickering glow of multiple digital displays, some mounted haphazardly on the walls, others jury-rigged onto makeshift workstations overflowing with tools, half-disassembled detonators, and spent bullet casings repurposed into something far more sinister.


[3/5/2025 5:02 PM] Doug
**"Careful where you walk‚Äîsome of this stuff is‚Ä¶ sensitive."** He watched Kaedues, closing the door as both of them were now fully in the apartment.


[3/5/2025 5:02 PM] Narration
A L-shape table was shoved against the farthest wall, barely visible beneath a mess of crumpled blueprints, half-burnt schematics, and handwritten notes in jagged, hasty script. Some were formulaic, detailing chemical reactions in a language only an expert could decipher. Others were simple reminders:
**Don‚Äôt overclock the charge again.**.......
.....**Find a cleaner escape route.**..................
...**No more ‚Äòexperimental‚Äô triggers‚Äîlost two fingers last time.**................................

The workbench, if it could even be called that, was an apocalypse of tools, wires, and explosive components. A disassembled blast vest lay in the center, next to a pile of pressure plates stripped from old industrial machinery. Several tablets were stacked on the side, their cracked screens frozen on schematics‚Äîdesigns that had probably been deemed "too dangerous" for public use decades ago.

A small fridge hummed in the corner, its surface covered in old stickers and sarcastic warnings.

The walls were the most telling part of the space. One side was pinned with surveillance photos, red strings connecting blurry figures and transport routes. The other was a collage of past work‚Äîdetonations captured mid-blast, printed clippings of ‚Äúmysterious sabotage incidents,‚Äù and old blueprints of buildings long since turned to rubble.

**This guy was a bomber...**


[3/5/2025 5:06 PM] Sophie Donovan
Sophie's eyes scanned the room. The coldest of chills running down her spine and straight to her toes with each passing second. She was not expecting Doug to be...this. What did this mean for her? Sophie slowly turned back towards the two since she was the furthest in the room. Her eyes primarily looking towards Doug.


[3/5/2025 5:16 PM] Kaedues Staub
*Kaedues' eyes thoroughally scan the entirety of Doug's apartment. Of course, Kaedues is normally thorough, but with each passing moment he only becomes more tense as to the implications of this man knowing Danny.. and possibly being a frequent contact. The tension drives him to look even __closer__ at each and every detail of this man's space.*

*He looks at Doug again.* **"I was wrong. Clearly, we operate differently."** *Kaedues pushes his hands into his pockets, fronting a completely neutral look to the redhead.*


[3/5/2025 5:19 PM] Doug
Doug locked the door back up, and once that was done, Doug reached into his waistband and pulled out his kinetic handgun. **""Aye, we do. Don't we? You weren't followed, were ya?"** He walked past Kaedues, moving towards the kitchen.


[3/5/2025 5:28 PM] Kaedues Staub
**"No, we were not followed."**
*(I get the feeling he'll habitually check the windows anyway. This place smells like paranoia.) The red-haired man notices Doug's locking of the door.*

*Kaedues walks forward toward the kitchen after Doug, minding the way he steps around the room.* **"You let us in. How do you know?"** *He asks plainly.*


[3/5/2025 5:35 PM] Doug
Doug would come to a stop eruptively, both Kaedues and Doug were mere inches from one another's faces. He would speak in a hushed tone so that Sophie couldn't hear. **"Who are you?"** He would let that question sink in for a moment. **"Because that's Donovan's daughter...Which, I figured you know that. I have been looking for her and somehow she is with you..."** He was still holding the handgun, but at his side.


[3/5/2025 5:48 PM] Kaedues Staub
*Kaedues locks eyes with Doug. He rolls his tongue around in his mouth for a moment as he considers his priorities in the moment.*
*(Looking for her..?)*

*Slowly, his dark voids seem to hone in even sharper on the man's face.* **"I'm a coworker who was in a few of the right places at the right times."** *He says plainly, to over-simplify his situation.*


[3/5/2025 5:55 PM] Doug
He nodded a few times, refusing to take his eyes off of Kaedues as he fished inside his pocket. Slowly, he withdrew his hand and held a micro card towards Kaedues. (Micro cards are shards that have a loaded balance of micro's on them. The amount loaded on them is shown on the micro display of the card and a green light indicates that its both legit and unused).  **"I'll give you 200,000 micros. Right here, right now, if you hand her over to me. Purchase a permit so you can cozy on over towards the other side of that wall and be square... No strings attached, mate."**


[3/5/2025 6:13 PM] Kaedues Staub
*Kaedues' eyes glance down toward the micro card Doug decided to present, and his hands ball into fists. When they resurface to look at Doug again, his expression has not changed. The red-haired man's expression, ever neutral, makes it hard to interpret what his answer is going to be in the first place.*

*His eyes linger now, producing some part of the suspense that is hanging in the air. The ensuing seconds that pass feel like they span across minutes.*

*Then, his eyes soften. He looks again at the micro card, and his eyebrows raise subtly. He leans his head back, like someone who is enticed by this kind of offer..*
*..and he shotguns his head forward, colliding his own forehead with Doug's as hard as he can. Before even a moment is paused, Kaedues pushes out a hook jab with his left arm toward Doug's side, below the ribs.*


[3/5/2025 6:20 PM] Doug
**"UG‚Äî"** His head snapped back from the impact, his nose making a satisfying crunching noise as the bone was crushed. The headbutt was enough for Doug to lose the card entirely, it went spinning in the air before clattering on the kitchen counter. The second strike below the ribs sent him in a downward spiral backwards, but **__He still had that handgun in his hand.__** He might need to wrestle with the guy on the ground if he doesn't want that weapon going off!


[3/5/2025 6:33 PM] Kaedues Staub
*Kaedues steps forward. With one quick motion, he crashes his boot against Doug's right wrist. In the same motion, he attempts to use his foot to swipe the gun away from Doug and enter a crouching position; his knee planted firmly onto the underside of Doug's elbow.*

*While he's here, Kaedues opts to smack Doug on both sides of the head. In particular, he's going for a clap on the ears.*


[3/5/2025 6:41 PM] Narration
Kaedues would get the jump on Doug. The stomp on the wrist was enough to mess with the signals going to his cybernetic hand and prompted it to release the handgun. With the swipe of Kaedues' boot, the gun went sailing towards the wall, rebounding off the floorboards and spinning out to where they came from.


[3/5/2025 6:41 PM] Doug
**"F-ck'n bit-"**


[3/5/2025 6:41 PM] Narration
Kaedues came down for the ear clap, but Doug managed to throw up his left bent arm in the path, preventing Kaedues from completing this tech. Kaedues still managed to slap the shit out of his right ear, but now Doug had some leverage.


[3/5/2025 6:41 PM] Doug
With the overall effects being nullified, Doug, gripped Kaedues' forearm with his left hand and slide it up towards the bend of his own elbow. Pushing on it to collaspe Kaedues' towards the collaspe point. With would allow him to twist and trade positions at that frame of time. With the roll, Doug got both of his hands freed and seized Kaedues' neck with his right and began to apply all of his weight down onto him.


[3/5/2025 6:51 PM] Kaedues Staub
*Kaedues is rolled over onto his back, and not without a struggle. As Doug straddles the gofer, he can feel the man's legs and restrained arm shifting. He tries to plant his feet on the ground, just as a start. For a brief moment, all of the struggling stops so he can focus a strike with his freed left arm underneath Doug's arms, toward the spot just below his chest.*


[3/5/2025 6:56 PM] Doug
Kaedues struck that __same__ spot he had punched earlier, prompting Doug to grunt in pain and move away from the source of the pain. **"Fucker!"** He'd curse as he brought his lessened the weight on Kaedues' chest so he could swing his legs off of him. He's planning something.


[3/5/2025 7:05 PM] Kaedues Staub
*Kaedues reaches upward with both arms, grabbing at the right side of Doug's torso. Now using his planted feet as a point to make leverage from, he pushes Doug's body due left in an attempt to throw him onto the floor. He pushes __hard__, hard enough for this to be realistic, and if fought against, cause difficulty with the man's balance.*


[3/5/2025 7:08 PM] Doug
With that added push from Kaedues, Doug crashed into the wall they were scuffling near and quickly got from his knees to his feet and made a break for it between the island and the kitchen counters which had his stove and fridge. Kaedues and Doug were now seperated!


[3/5/2025 7:30 PM] Kaedues Staub
*Kaedues makes a breakpoint decision as he rights himself to, quick as he can, grab the kinetic handgun from the floor. Chasing Doug through his own home would be completely moronic. He could have a remote bomb somewhere.*


[3/5/2025 7:32 PM] Narration
Kaeudes would reach the gun, losing track of Doug for just the briefest of moments to secure it.


[3/5/2025 7:43 PM] Kaedues Staub
*Kaedues quickly backpedals into the room he had entered from, toward Sophie and toward the locked front door. He checks the safety of the gun and how many bullets are loaded inside, as quickly as he can. Next, if even given the time, he would move to the east-most side of the room and grab the aforementioned L-shaped table. With one gigantic heave, Kaedues practically throws it across the room so that it would block the kitchen entrance.*

**"Get low!"** *He exclaims and turns to face the girl, crouching down himself now. He holds the gun low to the ground, his finger away from the trigger.*


[3/5/2025 7:56 PM] Sophie Donovan
Sophie, stood in the living room and had been watching the second half of the brawl with wide, unblinking eyes. The tension had seized her up, locking her in place like a statue while Kaedues and Doug tore through the space with violent force. Every brutal hit, every grunt of pain, sent a shockwave through her, but she didn't dare move‚Äînot yet.

When Kaedues suddenly backpedaled toward her, gripping a weapon, her breath hitched. The sight of the gun in his hand made her heart pound so loudly she swore it echoed in her skull. It wasn't the first time she had seen someone armed, but this felt different. It wasn‚Äôt just posturing or intimidation. It was **real**, and the way Kaedues moved‚Äîchecking the gun, assessing the room‚Äîmeant things weren‚Äôt over.


[3/5/2025 7:56 PM] Narration
Kaedues had 16 rounds in the fully loaded double stacked mag. The safety was off from the beginning...


[3/5/2025 7:56 PM] Sophie Donovan
Then came the crash of the table as he threw it across the room, barricading the entrance. That was when she finally snapped out of her frozen state. Her hands, which had been clenched into fists against her lap, shot to her ears on reflex at the loud impact, her shoulders hunching as if expecting an explosion to follow. 

`"Get low!"` Kaedues barked, and she obeyed before she even realized she had moved, squatting down and leaning against the wall with no escape... Her breath was ragged, her chest rising and falling too quickly. She could hear it‚Äîher own heartbeat, fast and uneven. She wanted to say something, to ask what the hell was happening, but her throat was dry, and she knew that if she spoke, it might come out as a frightened squeak. 

Her mind raced. `"Doug ran."`.......... `"Was he coming back?"`...... `"Was he getting a weapon?"`........ `"Was the place about to go up in flames?"` Kaedues had thrown that table like he was preparing for a warzone, and she didn‚Äôt know if she was ready for what came next.

Still, she forced herself to move, shifting to press her back against the wall of the apartment, curling up small. Her hands hovered near her head, shaking slightly, fingers flexing in and out of fists. She wasn‚Äôt crying, not yet, but she knew she was teetering on the edge of it. Utter shock was knocking on the doorsteps.


[3/5/2025 7:57 PM] Doug
**"YOU FUCKING BITCH!"** Doug screeched from around the corner. Drawers were thrown open, their contents scattering and tumbling against the floor, but none of it was visible to them.


[3/5/2025 7:58 PM] Doug
**"MOTHER FUCKER, YOU BROKE MY NOSE!"**


[3/5/2025 7:59 PM] Doug
**"FUCK YOU, FUCK YOU, FUCK YOU!"** More drawers came off of the rails and one of them sailed overtop of the table Kaedues used as a barricade.


[3/5/2025 7:59 PM] Narration
The drawer smashed into the front door, wood splintering.


[3/5/2025 8:00 PM] Doug
**"UUGHHHHHHARGH!!!!"**


[3/5/2025 8:06 PM] Kaedues Staub
*Kaedues looks back toward Sophie as Doug begins his temper tantrum. Kaedues is cold, but even he can tell that she's horrified. Even still, she should be. Kaedues looks toward the entrance of the kitchen, considering what to say.. and then back to Sophie. His voice is loud, but he is not yelling.*
**"Sophie. If we can restrain this person, __we can find your father__. I need you to help me do that."**

*His eyes move toward the entrance of the kitchen.* **"I need a shard. Anything that will help me with firearms. Can you do it?"**


[3/5/2025 8:15 PM] Sophie Donovan
Sophie‚Äôs breath hitched at the mention of her father. Kaedues‚Äô words cut through the swirling fear like a scalpel, sharp and direct. Find her father. 

That alone should‚Äôve been enough to make her move, to shove past the paralyzing weight pressing down on her chest, but her body was still stiff, locked in place from the adrenaline dump surging through her system. She knew what Kaedues was asking. He wanted one of her shards‚Äîa fragment of power, an edge in the fight. Her mind, however, was still lagging behind reality, struggling to catch up with the fact that Doug was still out there, that the place could go up in flames, that Kaedues expected her to help.

-# help

She sharply inhaled, Her hands shaking violently against the fabric of her jacket, brushing against the heavy, worn-out binder tucked beneath its folds. She had it. She always had it‚Äîher lifeline. That chaotic, stuffed collection of shards. Pieces of something greater, things she didn‚Äôt fully understand but carried anyway, because they were father's.

Her hands found their way inside her jacket, yanking the binder free with a clumsy urgency that sent caused her to pull on the zipper and too hard and caused the binder to pop open. Countless shards rattling out of their protective sleeves.

**"No!"** She cried. Kaedues could feel the shards hitting the back of his leg and boots. This was NOT good.


[3/5/2025 8:17 PM] Sophie Donovan
She got onto her hands and knees, discarding the case. She lost way too many of them... They were categorized, organized in a way that made sense  to her. Now, they were scattered across the floor. Mixing with Doug's things that littered the entire living room, making looking for a good shard a much more difficult task while under stress.


[3/5/2025 8:19 PM] Doug
It has been quiet ever since throwing that last drawer. But now, it sounded like he was closer to the table this time, but not enough to expose himself to Kaedues. He'd sigh out loud. **"You're a fucking dick, you know that?"**


[3/5/2025 8:31 PM] Kaedues Staub
*Kaedues glances behind him for a moment at the shards. Risk assessment of this situation practically declares that relying on that strategy this time is a bad idea.*

*The Caliber Man is forced to just take point, aiming the handgun toward the tiny sliver of an opening to the kitchen that he can see. In the moment, words completely escape him. His vision tunnels in as he looks in for the slightest sign of the man's presence. His finger hovers over the trigger, unmoving.*


[3/5/2025 8:34 PM] Doug
**"Remember, when I told you to watch your damn step?"** He'd ask another question. **"I'll be the first to tell you that the shit you've seen in the living room wasn't just for show and now, the playing field is __EVEN__."**


[3/5/2025 8:40 PM] Sophie Donovan
Sophie was crouched low, fingers scrambling across the floor as she gathered the shards that had spilled from her binder. Her hands worked quickly, desperate to recover them before something‚Äîor someone‚Äîforced her to abandon them completely. She barely even registered what Doug was saying, the tension buzzing in the air like a live wire.

Then her hand brushed against something that wasn‚Äôt a shard. The surface was metallic, cool to the touch, but wrong. It wasn‚Äôt smooth like her shards‚Äîit was segmented, with grooves, wires. Her breath hitched as her fingers froze over it. She looked down.

-# A bomb.

Her stomach lurched as her breathing hitched, a sharp inhale she couldn‚Äôt control. **"Kaedues..."** She was on the verge of crying, there was no mistaking the pure fear laced in it. Her pulse pounded in her ears, her entire body locking up because what the fuck was she supposed to do now?

`"The shit you've seen in the living room wasn't just for show. The playing field is EVEN."` How many more were there?

She remained as still as she could, looking around with only her eyes. Tears were beginning to spill from her eyes... Was she really going to die here?


[3/5/2025 8:42 PM] Doug
**"If I hear you break glass, make a run for the door, shoot at me. All three of us are going to meet our maker, ya feel me mate?"**


[3/5/2025 8:55 PM] Kaedues Staub
*Kaedues takes a deep breath in and then out. He considers Doug's words very carefully. He closes his eyes for a moment.*
*(If he's really claiming to be on equal footing.. I should assume he's using a dead man's switch. It gives him complete control over the situation.)*

*His eyes open now, and he takes another breath in.*
*(Obviously, his end goal is to take Sophie. He should understand already that I don't want to give her up. I fought him and took his gun over it. He'd call my bluff if I offered her, and then I'd really have to.) Kaedues' eyes narrow after those thoughts, and he shuffles closer to Sophie silently.*

**"Spit it out then!"** *He calls out to continue the conversation, and then turns to Sophie. His eyebrows twitch when he looks at her. He opens his mouth as if to say something, but does not.*


[3/5/2025 8:59 PM] Doug
**"All I wanted was the girl! Would've paid you for it too! Real mess you made of things, yah?!"** There was a pause. **"Now, I know who the real enemy is... Just hand over Sophie and you can walk away with your body still intact."**


[3/5/2025 9:11 PM] Kaedues Staub
*Kaedues purses his lips, clearly upset about what he says next. He whispers it to Sophie, making sure he's quiet enough so that Doug can't hear. His eyes move back to the gap in the wall, focusing on it.*

-# **"I need you to pay very close attention to me. We are out of options."** *Kaedues takes a deep breath in and out.* **"The __only__ way he will let up is if I hand you over to him."**

-# **"I need you to tell him you will go willingly."**

**"I should just hand her over so you can throw her in whatever god-forsaken hole the other three are, is that it?"** *He asks, practically calling out.*


[3/5/2025 9:17 PM] Sophie Donovan
Her brows furrowed and unfurrowed a few times, trying to understand what he was asking of her. She began to shake her head but stopped, clearly conflicted...


[3/5/2025 9:17 PM] Doug
**"Listen bud, if I was looking to eradicate the Donovan family, I would just have just blown you both up already. It ain't nothing like that! Sophie! I've known you since you were a kid! Me and your pops have been best of friends for a long long time!"**

**"I don't know what lies that man is feeding you, but he isn't on your side! You want your family, I can get you too them!"**


[3/5/2025 9:33 PM] Sophie Donovan
Sophie's heart was slamming against her ribs, her breath tight and uneven. The bomb. Doug's voice, **Kaedues' words.**

`"...tell him you'll go willingly."`

She almost shook her head again on pure instict, outright refusal, but the bomb changed everything. Doug was in control, and no matter how much she hated it, she had to **play along**. Her fingers twiched, fists teightneing as she fought to keep the tears from overtaking her sense of sight. 

Then, Doug's voice cut through the room again, talking about her father, about knowing her since she was a kid. The words sent something hot and ugly curling in her stomach. 

## Liar ##

## But wait, you recongized this man... Somehow ##

No, he wanted her to believe he cared, wanted her to believe he was the answer to everything. Maybe once, a younger, more naive version of herself might have fallen for it. Might have desperately clung to the idea that someone, anyone, could bring her back to her family. 

## But younger Sophie wasn't there anymore. ##

But the fact of the matter was that only __she__ wielded the power to find them, or so, she believed anyway. Her father was out there, sure‚Äî but the order of events did not make sense to her. It was like she walked right into the devil's den and dragged Kaedues into this hell. **She did this.** 

-# So, did she really wield the power? Or was that younger Sophie still here but wearing a different mask?

## He wants to use you, to Destroy you ##

She swallowed down her rage, her doubt, her pride. Taking a shaky breath, and allowing her body slump slightly. **"I..."** She hesitated, blinking rapidly, letting herself sound small. Uncertain. **"You... You really know my dad?"**

A pause. She let it stretch out like she was grappling with the decision. Then, she forced herself to lean into it. **"If you're telling the truth, then... I'll go."** The words felt like acid on her tongue, but she forced them out anyway, soft, hesitant, vulnerable. **"Just... just promise me you're


[3/5/2025 9:33 PM] Sophie Donovan
not lying."**

Her fingers curled slightly against the floor, the shards being pushed out from beneath her palm, **Please, let him buy it.**


[3/5/2025 9:36 PM] Doug
**"I have no reason to lie. Look, I know this situation looks bad. I am no saint and neither is your father. None of us are... But I ain't the bad guy here. Your friend here believes otherwise... Unless he's holding you hostage."**


[3/5/2025 9:49 PM] Kaedues Staub
*Kaedues nods to Sophie, finally looking at her. His eyes appear uncertain after the past few moments. Then he looks back to the kitchen.*
**"I want to believe what you're saying is true,"** *He calls out. He lets that statement sit for just a moment.* **"So prove it. If you don't do that, we will go __nowhere__."**

*He does not afford Doug the moment to respond.*
**"Make contact with Danny, and forward the phone conversation to Sophie so she can pick up."**


[3/5/2025 9:53 PM] Doug
**"I cannot do that, lad. He went dark, can't call'em. If it was that easy, Sophie could call him herself."**


[3/5/2025 9:53 PM] Doug
**"Whole family has been stripped of their communications. To protect'em."**


[3/5/2025 9:54 PM] Doug
**"That is, until the CCR rolls in their graves."**


[3/5/2025 9:57 PM] Kaedues Staub
**"Good."** *Kaedues turns to Sophie and nods.* **"That lines up."** *Now, he turns back to the kitchen.*
**"If you were responsible for taking the rest, you should know the order they disappeared. What is it?"** *He calls out next!*


[3/5/2025 10:00 PM] Doug
**"...Danny called me, picked up his wife while at her work and I found Mia outside of the condo."**


[3/5/2025 10:00 PM] Sophie Donovan
Sophie's eyes widened, Mia left the condo? She wasn't just kidnapped inside of the home? She thought someone snuck in and took her..


[3/5/2025 10:06 PM] Kaedues Staub
**"That's right."** *Kaedues nods to Sophie again. His eyes look back to the kitchen.* **"Last question."**

*Kaedues takes a deep breath in, and then out.* **"Danny has to leave the district because he was given a loaded order. What is it?"**


[3/5/2025 10:09 PM] Doug
**"Not my place to say."** He'd reply.


[3/5/2025 10:09 PM] Kaedues Staub
**"She knows the whole thing,"** *He butts in.* **"And so do I."**


[3/5/2025 10:10 PM] Doug
**"...It's about high-time we make the exchange."**


[3/5/2025 10:11 PM] Doug
**"I am getting impatient since I am leaking all over the bloody place."**


[3/5/2025 10:17 PM] Kaedues Staub
**"If what you've been saying is true, then we want the same thing,"** *Kaedues declares, still trying to play out the dialogue. He pauses.*
*(He is still holding out. Like my own position, he would not let up unless I prove beyond a shadow of a doubt that I am telling the truth.)*

**"..I was on site when he was given the order,"** *Kaedues declares out loud.* **"__Fred Dawson__ was told the same thing."**


[3/5/2025 10:19 PM] Doug
**"How do I know you're not an agent?"**


[3/5/2025 10:20 PM] Kaedues Staub
**"How do I know you aren't a trafficker?"**


[3/5/2025 10:21 PM] Sophie Donovan
Sophie had calmed down considerably after Doug was revealing evidence that he was familiar with her family's disappearance. **"Kaedues is my dad's co-worker... My dad let him stay at our house for a few days a few weeks ago."**


[3/5/2025 10:21 PM] Doug
**"..."**


[3/5/2025 10:24 PM] Narration
Moments later, the detenator for the explosives came into view and landed on the living room floor, tumbling a few times before resting.


[3/5/2025 10:24 PM] Doug
**"Toss that gun with the detenator."**


[3/5/2025 10:31 PM] Kaedues Staub
*Kaedues watches the detonator tumble to the floor. He pauses to completely acknowledge the significance of this.*

**"Hasn't gone both ways yet. If you answer my question, I'll toss it. Again-- What was Danny told to do?"**


[3/5/2025 10:36 PM] Doug
**"You really like pushin' your luck, don't ya mate? Takin' out Paige Underwood, yeah. Didn't do it and so now he's 'payin the price' in his own blood. Except, he has no intentions on doin' so."**


[3/5/2025 10:42 PM] Kaedues Staub
*Kaedues flips the safety of the gun. It clatters to the floor next to Doug's detonator.*
**"That's enough to know. It would be impossible for him to know all this if he isn't an ally."** *Kaedues turns to Sophie now. He regards her a bit and sees she is calmer.*


[3/5/2025 10:42 PM] Kaedues Staub
**"I'm sorry. None of this should have happened. Let's get the shards cleaned up, and then we can talk. But first.."** *Kaedues stands up now and approaches the table he had thrown across the room. He carefully slides the thing out just enough so that Doug could walk through.*
**"I'll help you put this place back together once those things are in their sleeves."** *He takes a closer look at Doug.* **"It's good to know he's got people that would go this far for him. She really might be safe on the other end."**


[3/5/2025 10:53 PM] Doug
Doug was just leaning against the wall with a towel in hand. He must've fished for one during his tantrum. **"Don't bother."** He muttered, **"You've done enough to help, thank you."** He said sarcastically. **"I'll just have one of my collegues figure it out when they come by later."**


[3/5/2025 10:57 PM] Kaedues Staub
*Kaedues lets out a half-sigh.* **"Let me put the table back at least. If I knew you were being honest I wouldn't have done any of this."**

*He navigates toward Sophie and begins to collect some of the shards on the ground. Instead of putting them in his own pockets, he just organizes them into short towers next to one another. That way, they are all in one place. Sophie would still have to organize it herself, but.. well, she was already going to have to do that.*


[3/5/2025 11:01 PM] Sophie Donovan
She sat there in front of the towers he was making. Her eyes following his hands and not much else. She could go for some rest right about now.


[3/5/2025 11:01 PM] Doug
There was a loud crack, **"Ugh... This shit hurts..."**


[3/5/2025 11:05 PM] Kaedues Staub
*Kaedues notices Sophie's expression, her exhausted body language. He takes the initiative to just.. grab the case off the floor next to her and begin sliding the shards into place. He has no idea how she'd do it, so he just fills the case one shard at a time.*

**"Is he doing alright?"** *He asks, looking backward at Doug.* **"Last you checked, I mean."**


[3/5/2025 11:07 PM] Doug
**"Yeah, that big goof ball is alright. Though, last time I've seen him he wouldn't stop going on about his kids."** Stuffing his nostrils with the towel which it's prodominate color was now red. He was against the wall himself, perpendicular to them.


[3/5/2025 11:13 PM] Kaedues Staub
**"..Good. That's.. good."** *Kaedues' neutral frown turns up into a soft smile. It's far from perfect, but this is one of the things he wanted to hear. Been a while.*

*Pretty soon, the shards are in the case. He zips it up and gives it to Sophie, or at least places it on the floor in front of her.* **"Just for full disclosure.. Do you trust this guy?"** *He asks her.* **"Everything looks like it lines up. If he says he's gonna bring you to your father, I'm pretty sure he will."**


[3/5/2025 11:17 PM] Sophie Donovan
She said plainly, her eyes still low, **"...I don't see any other options other than to trust both of you."**


[3/5/2025 11:17 PM] Doug
**"It will take time since I had to jump back on this side of the wall. Her old man is in Fairview with the other members of his old unit."**


[3/5/2025 11:17 PM] Doug
**"Well, one of them. The rest are unknowns to me."**


[3/5/2025 11:18 PM] Kaedues Staub
*He turns to face Doug.* **"We talking, just laying low for a few days? Or do you mean the travel will be slow?"**


[3/5/2025 11:22 PM] Doug
**"Lay low for a week or two. Agents were starting to track real close when I had Mia in tow."**


[3/5/2025 11:22 PM] Doug
**"At least here, they are slower to their prey."**


[3/5/2025 11:28 PM] Kaedues Staub
*Kaedues nods.* **"I can handle it. We've been faring fine for a few days."**
*Now he picks up the table he had thrown across the room before. He carries it through the air toward where it had been before and sets it down. Sophie's likely still near that spot, so if she doesn't get the picture Kaedues will just give her a head nod to signal she should move.*


[3/5/2025 11:30 PM] Sophie Donovan
She read the atomsphere and moved away from the corner, grabbing the binder and standing up.


[3/5/2025 11:38 PM] Kaedues Staub
*Kaedues makes one last look to Doug. He shoots the guy his contact info, and then steps toward the guy's front door. Assuming the thing would unlock with just some turns of knobs, Kaedues unlocks the door himself.*


[3/6/2025 10:59 PM] Narration
The door unlocked seemingly well. Just had to unlock three seperate locks to even consider turning the knob.


[3/6/2025 11:04 PM] Kaedues Staub
*The red-haired man turns back to look at Sophie. His eyes gloss over her haphazardly, and then onto the floor around her, possibly checking for any shards left unaccounted for. For a moment, his eyes glue solely to one point in the room.*

**"Are you ready to go?"** *Kaedues asks. His tone is plain like it always is.*


[3/6/2025 11:06 PM] Sophie Donovan
With Kaedues' help earlier, he managed most of them while she found the straggling ones. Putting the remaining shards back in the binder would take time. To avoid fixing it now, she resorted to stuffing them in her pockets for the time being. There was bound to be some time. Without a single word, Sophie wiggled her way past Kaedues out of the apartment room and heading for the stairs.


[3/6/2025 11:14 PM] Kaedues Staub
*Closing the door was par for the course when leaving. When Kaedues feels the thick of the door latch against its frame, he notices the sound it makes. It is loud-- at least, it is to him. He hesitates to step away, but after a moment without further noise he figures nothing happened and proceedes down the stairs after Sophie.*

*On the way down, Kaedues experiences something similar. Instead of acknowledging the sturdy construction of the concrete stairway, all Kaedues can think about on the way down is the sound of his boots against the stone.*

*If they aren't interrupted, Kaedues will follow Sophie all the way back to his restored delivery van.*


[3/7/2025 6:29 PM] Narration
Kaedues entered the delivery van. Sophie was already in the passenger seat with her head tilted down, her eyes glued on the tips of her fingers‚Äîprocessing what had just transpired moments ago. She slow blinked‚Äîher lips partially opened as slow and steady breaths came and left from her lungs.


[3/7/2025 6:37 PM] Kaedues Staub
*When he sits himself down, Kaedues instinctually grabs the driver's seat behind him and hoists himself up so he can look behind it into the loading bay of the truck. His eyes scan the area, and fall on the box of things behind Sophie's seat. He feels his fingers tingle under the pressure he puts on the backrest. Small creases and indents appear on the pleather beneath his hands.*


[3/7/2025 7:04 PM] Sophie Donovan
-# **"Thank you."** She muttered under her breath.


[3/7/2025 7:22 PM] Kaedues Staub
*Kaedues lets a breath escape his lungs while he sits back down. His body goes to turn toward the steering wheel but he hears Sophie speak and stops halfway. His attention points to her now. It takes him a moment, a delay, to vocalize a response.*
**"What for?"** *He asks. His usual directness is dampened by his exhaustion, and while he is still straight-to-the-point his voice is not nearly as sharp as it would normally be.*


[3/7/2025 7:27 PM] Kaedues Staub
*It does not occur to the work gofer to even imagine what she could be thanking him for.*


[3/7/2025 8:19 PM] Sophie Donovan
-# "You thought he was someone bad... You did everything you could to protect me..."

She does this thing, frequently. Avoiding eye contact whenever something is uncomfortable, unnerving. But, she would look in your general direction but lower... She continued to speak quietly...

-# "I over heard him talking... I couldn't handle the defense protocal so I slotted an auditory enhancer when I saw him and you walk into the kitchen.."

There was a pause as she blinked. Afterwards, she returned her gaze to her lap. 
-# "I did not trust you, and I still don't, yet.... I needed to say it... You needed to hear it. Thanks."
She then sunk into her scarf a bit more, narrowing her eyes. The adrendline dump was over and it was replaced with fatigue.
-# "I'm tired."


[3/7/2025 8:25 PM] Narration
It wasn't noticable before, but now it was raining... The rainfall battering the windows and windshield.

[3/7/2025 8:40 PM] Kaedues Staub
*Kaedues turns to face the windshield. His hands reach out, grabbing the van's steering wheel at 10 & 2. The young girl's voice, the words she chose, swirl and clatter around in Kaedues' headspace.*
*(She needed to say it?) It comes off to Kaedues like she implies she is obligated. (I needed to hear it..)*
*Staub has to assume he misunderstood, for clarity's sake. His eyes survey his hands gripping the wheel. His fingers fit into shallow grooves in the wheel created during his outburst in Kapea some time ago.*

*He breathes in. Had he felt the resistance in his lungs before deciding to speak, maybe he would have held his tongue.*
**"That is.. kind. Thank you."** *The words come out slowly and methodically but still sound ill-placed. They have little conviction.* **"If you believe that I want to return you to your father.. then that works well enough."** *His tone improves. He still speaks softly, but with more confidence.*

*He hadn't noticed it, but his hands are moving subtly. Shaking, or trembling. Recognizing this feels like an itch forming in his throat. Momentarily, Kaedues pictures the events that had just unfolded in his head. The position he took, the way the gun felt in his hands, the stress of the situation.. it should not have felt that way. Under these circumstances, Kaedues tries to infer he is going mad.. but he knows better. That feeling is not madness. If only it were madness, Kaedues could let it go.*

**"I would not trust me, either."** *He says softly. He doesn't start the van yet.*

-# "mmnn...." She hummed in a weakning acknowledgement.
Sleep threatened to overtake her and if she was not interrupted , she would fall asleep in mere moments.


[3/7/2025 9:17 PM] Kaedues Staub
*Kaedues swallows the spit in his mouth if only to punctuate.. everything that happened. As he sits in the car seat with his hands on the wheel, he finds himself fixating on what Sophie said. That he needed to be thanked, and that she didn't trust him.*

*A swelling, buzzing feeling rises up in his chest and in his skull. It does not limit his range of motion, or his autonomy.. and yet, it feels as though every action he makes is now on purpose, and met with a resistance. It feels like doubt.*
*(She never had trusted me to begin with. She may, however, be lying.) Kaedues glances over and notices Sophie is asleep. (She is asleep. It's something I did not think she would do around me.)*

*He looks at his hands again.*
*(In Kapea, she reclused herself in the seat. She did the same thing only a few minutes ago.)*

*(The way I have talked to her.. it is nothing out of the ordinary, to me.) Kaedues blinks, and his eyebrows push gently down over his eyes.*
*(To her..)*

*It was like a switch flipped. Kaedues recalls the scene where he had met Sophie, and the dialogue they shared up until this point.. but he imagines it from Sophie's perspective-- no, scratch that-- from an imaginary third person's perspective. It is like creating a second train of thought, having the cars move in parallel and watching the other train's path after jumping across.*


[3/7/2025 9:17 PM] Kaedues Staub·ûµ
*`(This is..)`*
*`It feels impossible to describe. In fact, it is impossible to look for the words to describe the kind of feeling that rises in his stomach when he recounts everything in this way.`*
*`(How could I not..?) He blinks. (What?)`*


[3/7/2025 9:47 PM] Kaedues Staub·ûµ
*`(It's..) In the moment, he is reminded how impossible it is to describe what it is he is feeling. Even then.. he finds it in himself to try, anyway. (It is..)`*
-# *`("Exceptional.") He hears the word in his head.`*

*`The word hovers in his headspace, but just as fast as it came, its presence in his head begins to fade out.`*
*`(..No,) Kaedues thinks, only beginning to form a thought. He fixates on the word, recognizing some semblance of familiarity that he does not let slip his mind. It's something he was told. No, it's not just something he was told, it's something he said..`*

*`Kaedues' breathing becomes slower. His hands only loosely grasp the wheel now and his eyes pick one arbitrary point on the windshield to dock themselves on.`*
*`(This.. does not make sense..) Kaedues thinks, narrates to himself. (The question she asked was so ordinary. There's no reason.. I should feel this tense when thinking about the answer.)`*


[3/7/2025 9:47 PM] Kaedues Staub·ûµ
-# *`("It's the only way I can keep going.") He hears himself talk.`*
*`(I.. was there for that. So...) The rooftop. Its details become foggy when he thinks of them. (That... never happened.)`*

*`The complexity of the kind of space he has fit his mind into quickly dawns itself on Kaedues. The feeling, the comprehension of some overbearing buzzing sound or touch is accompanied by the realization that much of what he is thinking about now is fading out. Quickly. Too quickly to take notes, or to tell anyone. So.. he presses his index finger and thumb together. He presses so hard he feels his finger might really give, and focuses solely on what he learned.`*


[3/7/2025 9:47 PM] Kaedues Staub
*Kaedues blinks, and shakes his head. Ten minutes have passed, and he hasn't even started the engine. He quickly reaches into his pockets and fetches the keys to the ignition, slotting them in and giving it a turn. It feels like he's just fell asleep for a few minutes. Maybe he needed it.*


[3/7/2025 9:51 PM] Kaedues Staub
*He checks his mirrors, takes one last look at Doug's apartment, and drives off. Obeying all of the traffic laws makes the drive very smooth. Kaedues decides to take the turns especially slow, and to take roads with lower speed limits where possible. Objectively, avoiding sudden starts and stops will decrease the likelihood of Sophie waking up. If a light switch is enough for her to wake up, then this would be too.*

[3/8/2025 6:06 PM] Sophie Donovan
She steps out of the vehicle and closes the door behind herself. Taking a few inquisitive glances down the length of the sidewalks before turning towards the clothing store. 

Unsurprisingly, the facade that made up the front building was a little worse for wear, but still served its purpose of advertising that it was a clothing store. The building was made of plaster and a large portion of it was peeling, revealing the cinderblock beneath it. Some sections had bullet holes and paint from vehicles that happened to collide with the building over the years.


[3/8/2025 6:10 PM] Kaedues Staub
**"I might as well get something too."** *Kaedues comments. His ashy green shirt and pants are.. torn up. Hopefully they have something that would work as a replacement, though. The style and practicality of this outfit have grown on Kaedues.*
*Kaedues locks the doors from the inside and then closes the door.*

*He leads by example and enters the store after that.* **"If it looks expensive, run it by me. I only have so much money,"** *He explains.* **"Otherwise, just pick whatever you want."**


[3/8/2025 6:16 PM] Narration
The two entered the store and the clerk working the cashier counter glanced over and rose his handgun as if he was expecting someone hostile?

**"Hey, I told you deckin' kids t‚Äî"** The clerk stopped and laughed. **"Ahaha! Well if it ain't Kaedues motha-fuckin' Staub."** His arms were extended to his sides, the handgun was now pointing to a customer who was checking out at the time. (He wasn't paying attention.)  

The customer instinctively ducked which prompted the clerk to glance over. **"The hell's your problem?"** Not willing to wait for a reply from the woman he turned his attention back towards Kaedues. **"Anyways, welcome in. Been a while since I've seen you 'round the strip."**


[3/8/2025 6:18 PM] Sophie Donovan
She froze at the door for the duration in which the gun was pointed in their direction. Unaware of Kaedues' affiliation with the guy. Once, she was clear from the muzzle, she relaxed just a smidge.


[3/8/2025 6:28 PM] Kaedues Staub
*Kaedues pats Sophie twice on the upper back softly, trying to silently tell her this isn't a dangerous situation.*
*..Well, with the way he's handling it, maybe it is.*

*The red-haired man steps forward. He leans his head back and eyes the clerk's gun.* **"Thanks, choom. I've been busy.. but you can probably tell. Just look at me,"** *He says and gestures to his ripped fit. He looks back at Sophie for just a moment to see if she began moving around yet.*


[3/8/2025 6:33 PM] Narration
The clerk would stuff the handgun in the back of his pants and continued working on his current customer's transaction. **"Yeah, you look like got into a scuffle with a jumpjunkie or two."** He then transition his glance towards Sophie. Then, back to Kaedues. He was ***__CONFUSED.__*** **"Who's the girl?"**


[3/8/2025 6:33 PM] Sophie Donovan
Nope, Sophie turned left and vanished behind a shelf. She did not one to be the center of attention.


[3/8/2025 6:40 PM] Kaedues Staub
**"Oh, her?"** *Kaedues pauses for a moment.* **"A friend of mine called in a favor. Gonna be looking after her for a bit."** *Kaedues then tries to deflect, pointing toward the clerk.. but below the belt, so he does not come off as accusatory.*

**"Are you trying to get investigated?"** *Kaedues says, referencing the man's gun.*


[3/8/2025 6:45 PM] Narration
**"Don't have much of a choice nowadays."** He would grunt, nudging his head to the immediate customer to scram. Once, they exited the store, he leaned against the counter‚Äîexpecting to have a full-blown conversation with Kaedues.

He would pick the rim of his nose with his pinkie finger. **"Crime here in Littleton has been getting worst over the last three years and it has only plateaued since these new synth heads started running around."** 

**"Gov been starting to pluck people off the streets for not upgrading to the new OS firmware. Talkin' about its a measure to reduce the out of control crime... Heard it was very successful in Kyrie, but I don't know."**

He'd then tap the side of his head, **"I had to get it in order to stay open."**


[3/8/2025 6:46 PM] Narration
**"Did you get yours?"** He'd inquiry.


[3/8/2025 6:54 PM] Kaedues Staub
*When he hears the question, a subtle pang rises in the back of his head. The kind of feeling most people would ignore out of habit. Unless you were looking out for it, that is.*
**"Yeah."** *He pauses to think. Give a supporting detail. One that will direct this conversation somewhere else.* **"There was a Gig of a line outside the office I went to. I almost __missed work__."** *He admits, or feigns to.*


[3/8/2025 6:57 PM] Narration
**"Beats being dragged. In here for anything particular? Need a replacement for that jumpsuit I take it?"**


[3/8/2025 6:58 PM] Kaedues Staub
**"You got me. Got anything of a similar make?"**


[3/8/2025 6:59 PM] Narration
**"You know I always keep those in stock."** He'd step away from the counter and walk deeper within his store. **"One moment."**


[3/8/2025 7:02 PM] Kaedues Staub
*Kaedues waits at the counter for the clerk to come back. Meanwhile, he looks behind him to see if Sophie had found anythting yet.*


[3/8/2025 7:02 PM] Narration
Sophie was nowhere in sight. Probably deeper within the store herself.


[3/8/2025 7:04 PM] Narration
Within the minute, the clerk returned to the front counter with a new jumpsuit for Kaedues. **"Prices for these went down too."**


[3/8/2025 7:06 PM] Kaedues Staub
**"Thanks, you know I appreciate it."** *He holds his right hand up to his temple to pay.* **"How much?"**


[3/8/2025 7:06 PM] Narration
He'd reply with the total. **"20 Micros."**


[3/8/2025 7:10 PM] Kaedues Staub
**"__Oh__, wow."** *He sounds surprised by the news!* **"Hold it a sec though, would you? I'll buy hers at the same time."** *He steps back and turns his head, making it obvious that he's going to go look for her before he makes the payments.*

*Kaedues moves in and out of the aisles to find the girl. He figures she just might be having a hard time finding what she's looking for.*


[3/8/2025 9:22 PM] Sophie Donovan
A few aisles later and Kaedues was able to find Sophie with a few things picked out. **"Almost everything they have is second hand."** She remarked.


[3/8/2025 9:32 PM] Kaedues Staub
*Kaedues huffs in amusement at Sophie's comment.* **"Yeah, for sure. That's how it is down here."** *He points to the clothing she had picked out.* **"The people here are good about washing the donations.. but you should give them a once over just in case."**


[3/8/2025 9:46 PM] Sophie Donovan
She looked down at the orange jacket in her hands. Certainly, she will do whatever she could to wash the hell out of it. **"I'm finished picking everything out.."**


[3/8/2025 9:47 PM] Kaedues Staub
*Kaedues just nods. He walks back toward the counter and raises a hand to the clerk.* **"Sorry for the wait. We're ready now."**


[3/8/2025 10:20 PM] Narration
**"No problem, choom. Let's see, with everything.. That'd come out to be 97 micros."**


[3/8/2025 10:24 PM] Kaedues Staub
**"..ch.."** *Looking at his account, that would place his balance at...*
*--well, the point is, the number looks bad. Kaedues instead wires the man 108.25 micros. It makes the last few digits in his account nice, whole, round numbers.*

**"There, that ought to do it. Thanks for your service, choom."** *With that, he would nod to Sophie and move to leave.*


[3/8/2025 10:26 PM] Narration
**"Stop by, anytime!"** The clerk remarked, giving them a wave as they exited the shop.


[3/8/2025 10:26 PM] Sophie Donovan
Sophie walked up to the passenger side of the van and waited for Kaedues to open the vehicle.


[3/8/2025 10:34 PM] Kaedues Staub
*It all happens in order and on time. Kaedues carries his new clothes to the van. He unlocks and opens the van and then, with the buttons provided on the door's side panel, unlocks the passenger side door for Sophie.* **"It's open,"** *He says. Normally he would just open the door for her, but he decides to allow her to do it herself.*

*The detail is small, even insignificant, but it is intentional and thought-of deliberately.*


[3/8/2025 10:45 PM] Sophie Donovan
Sophie, with her newly purchased clothes draped over the top of her off-hand would pull on the door handle of the passenger side door with her other. The door groaned in protest but as it swung further, it became easier on the hinges. 

The girl would use the handle situated along the vertical frame that kept the windshield in place to hoist her body up and placing her knee on the cushion. Then, she would swing her arm around to place her clothes on the dash before pulling all of herself inside the van and closing the door.


[3/8/2025 10:45 PM] Narration
Meanwhile, the rain had ceased to fall upon Littleton and hopefully the rest of Haven Heights. In it's wake, large puddles dominated the streets, the drains in the area had long been clogged and 'district services' only come around during emergencies.


[3/8/2025 11:00 PM] Kaedues Staub
**"We can wash them with the laundromat when we leave. You can just set them down anywhere until then."** *Kaedues directs his plans to Sophie, and buckles himself in without looking for the seatbelt or the holster.*

*With that, Kaedues turns the radio back on. His flash drive was already inserted, but turning the car off removed the previous playlist position and shuffle settings. It just plays the first song, and this time Kaedues is fine with that.*

[3/8/2025 11:00 PM] Kaedues Staub
*The van rolls forward through Littleton now. Kaedues accesses a map of the location and briefly surveys it while the van is still pushing on slowly..*
*By the time they had picked up any speed at all, he knew where he was going. He still does not tell Sophie where, though.*


[3/8/2025 11:06 PM] Sophie Donovan
The van's ability to handle the varying conditions of the road was something that could only be experienced. If her father's car was to dive into the potholes they had no way of avoiding, he would need the vehicle towed as the axel would've been blown.

This was a detail she had failed to note prior. But now that she has grown more comfortable around Kaedues, the smaller details stood out more to her. Sophie's attention returned to her favorite view location; The passenger window.

Littleton passed by them moderately fast. The sound of the tires pushing the water puddles from underneath the treads accompanied the radio and the outside ambient. Hmm.


[3/8/2025 11:12 PM] Kaedues Staub
*Kaedues never needs to go particularly fast to arrive at their location, which could indicate that it is nearby. He pulls in to the parking lot of an ice cream shop. The way he parks, the driver-side window is closest to the shop itself. Kaedues rolls down his window and sticks his head out to take a good look at the place, and then he turns to Sophie.*

**"What do you want?"** *He asks.*


[3/8/2025 11:21 PM] Sophie Donovan
The question took her by surprise. Getting ice cream was certainly not something she had in mind. **"Umm.."** Ice cream, when was the last time she had ice cream? As far as she could remember, never. **"No thanks."** Her brows knitted together, ice cream from Haven Heights? Yeah, she is not trusting it.


[3/8/2025 11:30 PM] Kaedues Staub
*Kaedues looks at her, confused for a moment. This was one of the one situations he hadn't accounted for.*
*A part of him wants to protest. There are a number of reasons why receiving something like this would be positive for someone in her position. The point of getting her a gift would be ruined by protesting now, though.*

*For a moment, he just looks at her. What about the gesture went wrong? To him, there is no difference between Fairview's food and Haven Heights food, or even just breakfast and dinner, for that matter. It doesn't occur to him that it could be as simple as taste.*
**"..Alright. We'll go wash your clothes,"** *He says plainly and starts the van. He'd begin driving toward the nearby laundromat.*


[3/8/2025 11:33 PM] Narration
Within no time, they arrived to the laundromat. It was extremely busy as usual. Many homes did **not** have access to running water so, the few locations that did received ample business.


[3/8/2025 11:45 PM] Kaedues Staub
*Kaedues pauses for a moment. He turns to look at Sophie, and then back into the laundromat..*
*(...Washing her clothes here would be fast, but it would put her at risk.)* **"Okay, after some thought, this is more complicated than I assumed it was."** *His attention turns BACK to Sophie __again__.* **"It would take us an hour inside the laundromat to wash your clothes. A lot of people could see you can talk about you later in that time,"** *He warns.*


[3/8/2025 11:47 PM] Sophie Donovan
**"...Can't we just come back later to pick the clothes up?"**


[3/8/2025 11:55 PM] Kaedues Staub
**"..What?"** *Kaedues' eyes narrow and begin to look around as he thinks for a moment.* **"..No, they.. would get stolen."**


[3/8/2025 11:56 PM] Kaedues Staub
**"This isn't a problem in Fairview?"**


[3/8/2025 11:56 PM] Sophie Donovan
She shook her head.


[3/8/2025 11:59 PM] Kaedues Staub
**"Well, I can take you to my house and we can wash them there."**
*He starts the van again, and begins to drive back toward his place. He makes a glance at her through the rearview mirror on the way there, just once. This whole situation feels like a run-on sentence..*


[3/9/2025 12:01 AM] Sophie Donovan
**"You have a washer and dryer?"** She asked, strange. When she was there, Sophie didn't see anything of the sorts.


[3/9/2025 12:02 AM] Kaedues Staub
*He makes a double-take at Sophie.* **"No?"**


[3/9/2025 12:35 AM] Sophie Donovan
Once more, she was confused... **"Then, how do you expect for me to wash the clothes?"**


[3/9/2025 12:43 AM] Kaedues Staub
**"In the sink."** *He responds punctually.*


[3/9/2025 9:04 PM] Sophie Donovan
-# **"I never heard of anyone washing their clothes in a sink.."** She muttered.

This was insanity‚Äîwashing clothes in a sink was unheard of. Same with not owing a washer and dryer. This was just yet another instance in which seperated the lives of those between Fairview and Haven Heights.


[3/9/2025 9:22 PM] Kaedues Staub
*Kaedues had already begun to pick up speed on the way back to his place. The silence, the gaps between the dialogue the two share are filled by a the constant noise Kaedues' van makes when its wheels roll against the uneven pavement. To an attent listener, it is the kind of white noise you could actually pay attention to.*

**"..You really mean that, don't you?"** *Kaedues feels like he has to ask for confirmation, even though Sophie's expression leaves little risk in assuming she is being honest.*


[3/9/2025 9:34 PM] Sophie Donovan
Sophie looks Kaedues in the face, then towards his hands on the steering wheel before looking forward once more. **"Yeah... I mean, I didn't know that places here were this bad off until I crossed the border..."**

There was a break in her train of thought. **"People always talked about how bad it was over here. I guess I expected them to be lying."**


[3/9/2025 9:39 PM] Kaedues Staub
**"Is this.. a belief that is common with the people in your social circle?"** *He goes on to ask punctually. The van slows down and then gently lurches forward when they stop at a red light. Kaedues' eyes briefly follow the image of one speeding vehicle, for a moment.*


[3/9/2025 9:42 PM] Sophie Donovan
**"I guess."** Sophie's eyes also lock onto the speeding vehicle, considering it stood out among the rest of the cars in the immediate vicinity.


[3/9/2025 9:48 PM] Kaedues Staub
*Kaedues becomes quiet. The silence he creates spans a decent length of time, enough to wonder if he will respond at all, or if he had a point in asking to begin with. His expression tightens though, maybe he is just thinking?*


[3/9/2025 9:49 PM] Kaedues Staub
*Cars continue to drive across the road intersecting theirs just ahead.*


[3/9/2025 9:57 PM] Sophie Donovan
**"You've been to Fairview... I would expected an adult to have notice those things."** Sophie says as she turned her attention to the sidewalk to her right. There were two kids vandalising the side of a convience store.


[3/9/2025 10:11 PM] Kaedues Staub
**"I did not socialize very much at the time."** *The light ahead turns green, and the van accelerates on cue.* **"Best I got was taking a job from a woman I found at a clothing store. She said her plumbing had gone completely haywire."** *Kaedues checks his mirrors. His head leans left and right, but his eyes glue to the road.*

**"Expensive computer installations.. hair product.. 'house plants'.. I have never been able to buy any of those things. I had never seen them in a home before either."** *He puts a particular stress on his tone when he says 'house plants', like those are especially alien. Is he also implying he doesn't use hair product?*


[3/9/2025 10:14 PM] Sophie Donovan
**"..."** Sophie makes a mental note of everything, but does not speak for the rest of the car ride back to his house.


[3/9/2025 10:19 PM] Kaedues Staub
*After some time, but not immediately before they arrive, Kaedues speaks up.*
**"Your local government must know about what you said. If there is no one to correct you about your assumptions, then.. it means the regency benefits from this."** *He pauses as they turn onto the road that would lead to his home.* **"It is possible that they even want you to think this."**


[3/9/2025 10:29 PM] Sophie Donovan
**"I would have said you were a insurrectionist if you said this to me a week ago..."** Her brow knitted together as she looked down at the passenger console intently. Thinking on how she feels now. 

**"But, after what I have learned in the last few days. I am unsure if that is unfounded. You cannot have opinions questioning our government. You're either with them, or against them."**


[3/9/2025 10:33 PM] Kaedues Staub
*Kaedues glances at Sophie puzzled. He doesn't say anything. He looks back at the windshield, his expression having changed--tightened. His van pulls to a smooth stop in his driveway without another word spoken.*

[3/11/2025 11:17 PM] Narration
Kaedues entered Littleton. By this time, the sun has finally set and all that was left was a hint of orange and the vastness of purples and blue hues blanketing the skies.

Kaeudes was entering a section of Littleton that was much better off than most. This area was closest to Kapea and not so much on the border since Kapea was the area just further North. Had they traversed a few more blocks, they would be in Kapea.

The street lamps were all on and illuminating the roads. Well, most of them anyways were on. There were some that were burnt out and others that got hit by cars and were removed as a result.

The atmosphere feels calmer than the more batter parts of Littleton, but there's still an underlying roughness. The asphalt is cracked in places, patches of hastily done repairs forming unevening patterns beneath the streetlights. 
The glow of neon signage from corner stores and late-night diners spills onto the sidewalks, muted compared to the garish advertisements of wealthier locations like Cedar Square.

The buildings here are modest bu better maintained than those further south and West‚Äîmulti -story apartment complexes with external stairwells zigzagging up their facedes, rust forming where metal railings meet concrete. Some windows are lit, showing sillhouettes moving inside, while others are covered with thick curtains or cheap holographic filters mimicking better views. Small balconies jut out here and there, cluttered with fordable chairs and drying laundry.

A few cars are parked along the curb‚Äîolder models, gasers, nothing high-end, with the occassional electric vehicle humming as it idles. The sidewalks have the usual urban wear‚Äîfaded chalk drawings from what kids have been brought to this insufferable world. An overturned trash can spilling it's contents, and a couple of stray shopping carts abandoned near a bus stop with a dimly glowing timetable dispaly.

A few pedestrians move about, mostly keeping to themselves‚Äîsome heading home after late shifts, others out for reasons best not questioned. A group of teens loiters near a vending machine, its touchpad interface smeared with fingerprints. Further down, a couple leans against the hood of a car, quietly sharing a smoke beneath the broken glow of a streetlamp.


[3/11/2025 11:32 PM] Sophie Donovan
Sophie's eyes remained glued on the teenages by the vending machine. Perhaps it was because they were about her age and were curious or maybe it was just because they were the closest.


[3/11/2025 11:38 PM] Kaedues Staub
*Kaedues steers slowly and carefully around straightaways and bends alike to get to the scene aforementioned. He pulls closer to the couple, wanting a better look just in case.*
*He does, however, notice Sophie looking at the teens.* **"You think they are a good idea?"**


[3/11/2025 11:42 PM] Sophie Donovan
**"I wouldn't trust them with a metal pipe."** She admitted, keeping her eyes on them.


[3/11/2025 11:42 PM] Narration
The couple is unassuming and most importantly, not of any significance. Neither of them were Noelle or Xavier. The couple's gaze followed Kaedues' vehicle for a few momenets before going back to their smoking session. The teenagers were messing with the vending machine. One of them had some sort of circuit board with leads attached to the vending machine. Were they trying to hack it?


[3/11/2025 11:44 PM] Kaedues Staub
**"Don't trust anyone around here with a metal pipe."** *The van keeps rolling. Kaedues steers it forward, until the atmosphere of the place seems any poorer. First, find the perimeter of the general area Kaedues guesses, and.. comb it. If that doesn't work, he'll figure something out.*


[3/12/2025 12:07 AM] Narration
As they move further down the road, the neighborhood feels more repetitive, as if they are looping through different versions of the same scenery. More low-rise apartment buildings, some with their entranceways dimly lit, others swalloed in the darkness of the looming night. Storefronts with iron shutters drawn down line the occassional street corner, the remnants of their last customers leaving behind discared food wrappers...

Down the road was the laundromat they were initially going to go to. It's rotating drums visible through the fogged-up window, a single exhausted worker slouched in a plastic chair near the counter.


[3/12/2025 12:09 AM] Kaedues Staub
**"Huh. Should have just waited a few hours,"** *Kaedues muses to himself as he passes by the place. He gives the interior a good look, noting the person inside and the general availability of the machines at this hour. Really could have saved them the trouble.*


[3/13/2025 1:56 PM] Narration
Kaedues passed by the laundromat on his right. Once past it, he would see a chainlink fence and beyond it a playground. The area appears to be a frequent location for the local teen population as there were at least a dozen of them hanging around the grounds equipment. Two girls were on a swing, talking to one another about whatever girls in Littleton talk about.

There was a large crowd of boys in a circle, hooting and hollering. Both Kaedues and Sophie could catch glimpses of what was going on in the core; A fight between two of them and one was certainly getting the better of the other.

Some went on walks while others were standing, hanging or swinging on various items, enjoying the night as if it was noon. Not a single guardian was present, but as long as they don't start too much trouble, who cares?


[3/13/2025 1:59 PM] Narration
On the left, a convienent store was closing up. It's shop owner pulling down the shutters for the windows to prevent any nogoodoers from breaking in while he headed home for the night. Kaedues' headlights drew the attention of the shopkeep‚Äîhis head turned towards the moving vehicle and once it was about 30 yards passing, the shop keep lost interest.


[3/13/2025 2:04 PM] Narration
## Ding.... ding.... ding.... ## 
Kaedues' van was chiming.. Attempting to alert him to something, the instrument cluster before him showed a gas indication. He was getting low on fuel.


[3/13/2025 2:04 PM] Narration
Lucky for Kaedues, there was a gas station just up ahead and not busy either.


[3/13/2025 2:36 PM] Kaedues Staub
*(There it is,) Kaedues thinks to himself as his eyes quickly glue to the fuel gauge. It was only a matter of time before he would have to fill up. (but damn, does this thing get good mileage. I didn't expect that.)*

*He glances into the laundromat again for a moment before deciding to drop it.. for now.* **"Hold on. I'm going to fill up on gas before we keep going."**


[3/13/2025 2:37 PM] Kaedues Staub
*(Maybe should have brought her sleeping bag.)*


[3/13/2025 2:42 PM] Narration
Kaedues pulled into the gas station. There was only one other vehicle at one of the eight pumps available. The owner of the vehicle was dozing off against the quarter panel of his car‚Äîwaiting for it to finish pumping.

The gas station was a bit run down, some of the signage was burnt out and there was trash littered everywhere, but hey these pumps were self service pumps, enabling drivers to pay at the pump.


[3/13/2025 2:42 PM] Sophie Donovan
Sophie looked around, silently observing the gas station, the lone customer across the station from them and the surrounding area.


[3/13/2025 2:46 PM] Kaedues Staub
*Kaedues glances at Sophie, and then his eyes avert to his lap to think. His eyes flutter, and he exits the van. He makes quick work of operating the pump and filling up his van. Considering his surplus of micros, he figures he may as well fill the van all the way up.*
*(Just once, I don't want to count my micros by the tenths.)*


[3/13/2025 2:56 PM] Narration
30 gallons later, the van was filled to the brim for the rate of ‚Ç•R 1.50 for a total of ‚Ç•R 45, even. With some additional pumps here and there to get a whole number.

[3/13/2025 2:58 PM] Sophie Donovan
Sophie would pop her head out of the window. **"Do they have food?"** Sophie asked, looking in his direction before glancing towards the gas station building itself.


[3/13/2025 3:01 PM] Kaedues Staub
**"..Oh, that's right."** *Kaedues says out loud like he forgot she had to eat.* **"They probably do. Do you want me to grab you something?"** *He returns the pump to its place, closes the gas cap, and navigates to the door where he has a more properly positioned conversation with the girl.*


[3/13/2025 3:02 PM] Sophie Donovan
Sophie wasn't going to trust Kaedues with grabbing anything for her. The likelihood of coming out with something she would like was slim, but not zero. **"I want to see what they have."**


[3/13/2025 3:05 PM] Kaedues Staub
**"When I take you into public spaces, you need to commit to leaving before you make an impression. Does that make sense?"** *He throws out a curveball question. Maybe it would lead to the answer she is looking for?*


[3/13/2025 3:06 PM] Sophie Donovan
Sophie blinked at the sudden question. Confusion clearly written upon her features. **"Leaving... What do you mean?"** asking for further clarification.


[3/13/2025 3:09 PM] Kaedues Staub
*Kaedues quickly thinks of a description that would service..*
**"In this situation, you want food. I want to minimize the risk of you being recognized. We can do both."** *His chest rises and falls quickly.* **"Think of the kind of food you want here, in the car, so you spend as little time as possible inside where people we don't know can see you. Once your business is done, you need to leave the store."**


[3/13/2025 3:11 PM] Sophie Donovan
Sophie retreated into the van a slightly, her gaze pointed down to the side, indicating that she was considering what she really wanted. The likelihood of them carrying what she wants and coming up with alternatives in case they do not carry it. 

Think simple. Think lean? 

After about half a minute of consideration, she returned her gaze toward Kaedues. **"I know what I want."**


[3/13/2025 3:13 PM] Kaedues Staub
**"Okay, good."** *Kaedues looks both relieved and satiisfied. He cocks his head once toward the store, signaling her she can get out of the car. He waits for her to exit so he can approach (more or less) next to her as opposed to taking off now and having to wait for her to catch up.*


[3/13/2025 3:14 PM] Sophie Donovan
The girl would roll the window back up before popping the door open and closing it behind herself. A quick look left and right sufficed as she links with Kaedues.


[3/13/2025 3:18 PM] Narration
The two walked towards the building. The driver of the other vehicle was sound asleep as he leaned against his car upright. Unfortunately for him, falling asleep with a vehicle that doesn't automatically stop the nozzle from overfilling the tank isn't such a great idea.

Gas began overflowing slowly and the pattering of gasoline wasn't enough to wake him until the pressure built and the nozzle came flying out of the car and dosing him in gasoline. **"AHGARH FUCK! WH- AH SHIT FUCKING HELL!"** He was pissed, picking up the nozzle and stomping his foot. Now, he smelled like straight gas.

She side-eyed the upset individual as they entered the building.


[3/13/2025 3:20 PM] Narration
The pair entered the gas station. The counter was outfitted with bullet-proof glass and cheap foods were on display from end to end. Beverages were towards the back.


[3/13/2025 3:20 PM] Sophie Donovan
Immediately, she got to work looking for __it__. Not sparing a second of time.


[3/13/2025 3:23 PM] Kaedues Staub
*Kaedues reaches into his pocket and pulls out his little packet of gum.*
*(I don't really need more, but.. I could definitely go through a pack in two weeks.) Now, Kaedues approaches the counter. He holds the packet up to whoever is operating the station.*

**"Hey. Do you sell this here?"**


[3/13/2025 3:27 PM] Narration
The gas station clerk was watching the CCTV footage from behind the counter. Observing the dumbass that was outside still throwing his hissy fit. Finally, some entertainment for a damn change. Thought the clerk, the man lazily slurped on a slushie, some three hour nachos rested nearby on a plastic tray.

When Kaedues called for his attention. First, the man's eyes moved towards him. With a sigh, his hand slipped from his cheek and he sat up straight in the chair he resided in. 

Great, a customer asking about product. Why can't he just fuck off? The man leaned in, the scuffed glass making it difficult for him to see anything from a distance. After a moment to appraise what was in his hand, the clerk shook his head. **"They don't make those anymore. Huge recall since they talk about health and blah blah politics‚Äîand plus, I haven't sold a single one. Well..."** He paused, looking over at his register for a moment as it chimed. Notifying him that the man pulled off from the pump.

He would then rummage his hand in the nacho tray, plucking a stale nacho with harden cheese off and placed it on his tongue before retracting it and chewing... **"Well, I sold a entire box to someone a few hours ago. Kind of weird that you askin' for it, no one likes that shit aside from you and some other guy."**

*Kaedues' eyebrows furrow in confusion.* **"..Thanks."** *He says plainly. Instead of asking this guy, he just accesses the internet and makes a search.*
`Caffeinated Gum by Leben`
*Then he turns away. Before he pockets the package of gum, he.. removes another strip and places it on his tongue.*
*(Gum is huge, and easy to produce. Health concerns shouldn't even happen.)*


[3/13/2025 3:44 PM] Narration
Reports compiled before Kaedues' eyes. Leben has been audited by a health and safety firm and had found that there were many cases of kidney and liver failure among consumers. However, before any fines or lawsuits could be filed, the company staffers fled the district and abandoned their workers at the factory they have in Kapea.


[3/13/2025 3:50 PM] Kaedues Staub
*.......*
*....chew*
*(This is organized enough to be real, but it doesn't make sense. To my knowledge, I'm not having any troubles there.) Kaedues thinks to himself. His knowledge of medical conditions is.. serviceable at best.*

*(Gonna have to take a look at that..)*
*He looks into this a little more where possible. Is the factory they produced this stuff at available on the public internet?*


[3/13/2025 4:24 PM] Narration
It is!

-# Beep!
Something was scanned while Kaedues was surfing the net.


[3/13/2025 4:25 PM] Kaedues Staub
*Kaedues makes a mental note of the place's coordinates. He turns to the counter, looking for whoever scanned the item.*


[3/13/2025 4:27 PM] Sophie Donovan
Sophie had the clerk scan the barcode of the paper-like lid of a bowl of noodles. Steam was rolling off of them. There was a vending machine deeper within the gas station that vends prepared meals on top of that, she procured a bottle of water. How safe is the water, who knows?


[3/13/2025 4:29 PM] Kaedues Staub
*Kaedues nods.* **"Good choice,"** *he comments and then shoots the clerk a look.* **"I'll pay. How much?"**


[3/13/2025 4:31 PM] Narration
**"9 Micros."** He replied, shoving another greasy stale nacho into his mouth.


[3/13/2025 4:33 PM] Kaedues Staub
*He pays 10. Then, he looks down at Sophie.* **"Are you all set?"**


[3/13/2025 4:35 PM] Sophie Donovan
Sophie nodded towards Kaedues.


[3/13/2025 4:38 PM] Kaedues Staub
*Without another word, he moves to leave the store. The atmosphere outside--colder, thinner-- prompts a change from Kaedues. He glances down at the noodles she's holding.*
**"Noodles were the only thing I ate when I was in Fairview. I stopped at a food truck in Cedar Square."**


[3/13/2025 4:43 PM] Sophie Donovan
Sophie glanced over and up to him as he spoke to her. Once he finished sharing his tidbit, she also had something to share in relation to the noodles. **"I'm not allowed to have these at home."** She confessed openly as she looked down at her bowl of noodles. Her stomach was growling.


[3/13/2025 4:45 PM] Kaedues Staub
**"What, why?"** *He asks promptly. For once, he displays how the statement makes him feel on his sleeve-- confused. Maybe even a little suspicious, but not too much.*


[3/13/2025 4:50 PM] Sophie Donovan
**"Our mom has us on a stringent diet. These have a unhealthy amount of sodiumn."** With the plastic chopsticks, she would stab them into the bowl with the water bottle tucked underneath her arm and would take a large mouthfull of noodles.

At least a dozen strings of noodles remained dangling from her mouth as she worked on chewing. For the first time, Sophie had a content look on her face; A subtle smile.


[3/13/2025 4:55 PM] Kaedues Staub
**"I can tell,"** *He comments passively as he approaches the passenger side of the van.* **"You called it 'sodium'. Only doctors and dieticians care that much."** *He muses, and opens the door for Sophie. She has her hands full and all.*


[3/13/2025 4:57 PM] Sophie Donovan
She was still chewing. So, accepting the gesture, Sophie hopped into the van and continued to shovel more noodles into her mouth.


[3/13/2025 4:59 PM] Kaedues Staub
**"Slow down a sec. I have to pull the van out onto the side of the street."** *He says out loud. More of a warning than a command, really.*
*On cue, Kaedues closes the door and moves to the other side of the vehicle. He'd promptly get inside, turn the van on, and pull out of the gas station.*


[3/13/2025 5:03 PM] Sophie Donovan
**"Mmn."** The van rocked back and fourth due to the steep decline and the angle in which the van entered on. She did her absolute best to keep the bowl leveled, preventing any mishaps from occuring. 

**"My mother is a researcher for the same company you and my dad worked for."** She informed Kaedues during that brief moment she was spooling more noodles around the chopsticks. **"I guess anyone who has a degree cares about what is in our foods... I know I don't."** And back with refusing the let up on the gas. Another mouth full!


[3/13/2025 5:07 PM] Kaedues Staub
**"I hope she never finds out I give you food from down here, then."** *With the van parked, Kaedues leans back into the driver's seat.* **"If you don't want to shit bricks, you actually should be worried about what's in the food down here."** *Kaedues comments.* **"I should drive you to west-side and let you watch what happens after someone buys from a food truck __there__."**


[3/13/2025 5:09 PM] Sophie Donovan
She looked over at him with noodles in her mouth. Then, she proceeded to shake her head vigirously. **NO WEST SIDE FOOD**

[3/13/2025 5:11 PM] Kaedues Staub
*Kaedues reaches into his pocket and pulls out the packet of gum.* **"Hopefully not related.. but apparently, this brand of gum isn't being sold anymore. Something about an audit. Kidney and liver failure."** *He flashes her the packet.* **"Have you seen these anywhere?"**


[3/13/2025 5:13 PM] Sophie Donovan
Chew...chew...chew... 
-# chew... chew.........chew.

**"Never seen it."** She remarked, repeating the process of collecting more noodles. **"I heard you talking with the clerk about it."**

**"You should stop chewing it."** She suggested.


[3/13/2025 5:15 PM] Kaedues Staub
**"I have none of the symptoms of either health issue, and I've been eating the gum for..."** *He pauses to think.* **"My entire career, actually."** *The explanation is placed more of a defense to her suggestion.*


[3/13/2025 5:17 PM] Sophie Donovan
She did not read into much further than that.  Setting the bowl down on her lap, she was now unscrewing the cap for her water. **"Count yourself lucky. If I had chewed gum and my mom heard of the audit, she'd kill them personally."**


[3/13/2025 5:24 PM] Kaedues Staub
*Kaedues chuckles. He didn't ever get that impression from Stephanie. Imagining her killing anyone sounds far fetched.* **"For people, to bother is to care. It sounds like you're annoyed, which is why I mention it."** *Kaedues leans his head back, rolling the gum around in his mouth. He finds himself waiting for it to suddenly taste different.. but it never does.*

**"At least your parents don't act like the ones down here. Build their whole life up to having a kid, and every time they realize they cannot handle the burden. One way or another, they get abandoned. Distanced from."**


[3/13/2025 5:29 PM] Sophie Donovan
Screwing the cap back on her water, she sat it aside and re-aquired her food. **"Is that what your parents did to you?"**


[3/13/2025 5:31 PM] Kaedues Staub
*Kaedues pauses for a long time. Thinking about what to say? How to say it? Should he even respond? His expression is plain again. It's not really clear how he took the question.*

**"Yeah,"** *He answers.* **"Had to learn to do everything on my own."**


[3/13/2025 5:34 PM] Sophie Donovan
**"I've always wondered what it would be like without parents..."** She was collecting the noodles from the bowl, but as she processed what she was going to say. the swirling stopped. **"I guess now, I get a sense of why I  feel dejected."**


[3/13/2025 5:35 PM] Sophie Donovan
She would close her eyes and take a deep breath. **"I am just thankful to know at least everyone is safe and is waiting for me."**


[3/13/2025 5:36 PM] Sophie Donovan
**"It can't come any sooner."**


[3/13/2025 5:41 PM] Kaedues Staub
**"It is very similar to what you have experienced so far, but not exactly. You are in a biased situation."** *Kaedues looks casually over to her.*
**"Not knowing who to trust, or if you ever made the right call in the first place? I know what it is like."**

*His face stays pointed at her, but his eyes move away. He waits for a few long moments, only thinking about something.*


[3/13/2025 5:50 PM] Sophie Donovan
**"..."** She returned his gaze.


[3/13/2025 5:50 PM] Narration
Behind Sophie, Kaedues could potentially see Noelle walking up to her apartment.


[3/13/2025 5:50 PM] Noelle
Yet another stroke of luck for Kaedues would have it that he drove by. Noelle was unlocking the door to her apartment. In her arms were several bags of groceries that she picked up from nearby. 

A led light above the door provided any on-lookers ample light to see her underneath it. Fumbling with her keys with both hands occupied.


[3/13/2025 5:56 PM] Kaedues Staub
*__Whatever__ Kaedues had been thinking of goes flying out the window when he sees Noelle. He nods his head toward her in a signal to Sophie and gets out of the car. He locks it as he leaves, but Sophie should still be able to get out from the inside.*

*Without waiting at __all__ Kaedues would begin to approach her.* **"Need a hand?"** *He calls out from the short distance.*


[3/13/2025 6:04 PM] Noelle
Kaedues' sudden call out to her prompted the woman to yelp. Turning so that her back was against the door as to see who her attacker was. Since she was underneath the bright light, Kaedues and Sophie's silhouette were all she was able to see for a brief while.

Then, Kaedues came into the light, revealing his features to the woman. **"I‚ÄîYou're..."** Her face shifted with recongition of the man with the red hair, though she did not yield her guard even with the groceries in her hands.

This was sudden, and very unexpecting. Finally, the question registered with the woman. Calling for her to scramble for a response. Upon seeing Sophie, Noelle eased up a little, but she still did not understand how and why Kaedues was there **"I...sure."** She relented.


[3/13/2025 6:11 PM] Kaedues Staub
*Kaedues closes the distance, making sure not to move too sudden. This situation will be volatile. The only thing Kaedues can do is manage __how__ volatile.*

*For now, he just reaches forward-- not to grab, but to offer-- a hand.* **"I'll hold a couple."** *He decides to wait a few more moments before dropping any bombs. Let her put the bags down, at least.*

[3/13/2025 6:44 PM] Noelle
Reluctantly, Noelle off-handed two bags to Kaedues. Leaving her with two more. Keeping her back partially to the door, she looked out for anyone else that may be nearby; Not entirely feeling comfortable with either Sophie and Kaedues. 

She turned the knob of the apartment and opened the door. The dimly lit apartment had a neon hum of blue and orange LED strips, casting eerie shadows across the cluttered space. The harsh daylight from earlier is gone, replaced by the cool artificial glow seeping from exposed wires and outdated fluorescents that buzz faintly overhead. The scent of stale cofee and soldered circuitry lingers in the air, mixing with something faintly metallic‚Äîmaybe  ozone from a nearby terminal by the door still running diagnostics.

The orange couch looked sunken and muted under the haze, its surface worn and patched with makeshift repairs. A couple of pillows were also faded prints on the face of them... Sitting askew as if someone left in a hurry. 

The coffee table in front of it is littered with empty cans, a half-smoked cigarette and scattered tech components.. Likely from her significant other's job. To their 12 oclock, the yellow cabinets and kitchen counter are dimly illuminated by the same neon glow from a work bench with tools and circuit boards. The window above the sink barely lets in any outside light, just the occassional flicker of the signs outside and glowing towers are previlent.

It's a lived-in place for sure.

**"Sorry about the mess.."** She apologized as she made it to the partial kitchen. Setting the groceries down on the sink

*Kaedues enters the space she lives and looks around enough just to get an idea of his surroundings. He doesn't allow his gaze to linger anywhere for too long. He follows behind Noelle and sets the groceries down alongside where she had.* **"It's not a problem. I should be the one apologizing, anyway. Finding you like I did is incriminating."**


[3/13/2025 7:39 PM] Noelle
**"Yeah...."** The word trails as she takes a step back and faces him. **"What... brings you around..?"** How she moves about the apartment. The way she watches Kaedues. To say Noelle was apprehensive of anything that he said or does. 

Sophie's presence was pacifying. However, the mystery behind this event has yet to be solved.


[3/13/2025 7:50 PM] Kaedues Staub
*Kaedues' chest rises slowly, building up in time with his own apprehension. Then, quickly it falls as he resolves himself.*
**"I need a favor from someone,"** *Kaedues begins. He pushes his hands loosely into his pockets.* **"and you fit the profile."**

*He looks right at her. Being direct is his go-to.. but in this position, the idea of putting out all the details feels ill to Kaedues.*
**"What I'm going to ask you __won't work__ if you don't comply of your own free will. Even if I could force you, it would shoot me in the ass."**


[3/13/2025 8:30 PM] Noelle
Noelle's fingers flex at her sides, tension winding through her shoulders. Her gaze flickers between Kaedues and Sophie, searching for an answer neither of them offers just yet. The way Kaedues speak‚Äîso matter-of-factly, yet careful‚Äîunsettles her. She isn't used to being approached like this. She isn't used to *fitting a profile for anything but trouble.*

Her lips part, as if about to speak, but she hesitates. The unspoken weight in Kaedues' words is pressing on her, and she doesn't like it. 
**"That's... vague,"** she finally mutters, shifting her stance just enough to put a little more distance between them. **"And kind of troubling."** Her brows furrow.


[3/13/2025 8:30 PM] Sophie Donovan
Before Noelle could get the wrong idea, Sophie interjects, closing the door behind them and entering the living room space. **"If I were you, I'd be skeptical too... But this is about me, more than anything."** Sophie exhaled. **"I was separated from my parents, and to make matters worse, they are trying to catch him up with something he is not doing and potentially take me away for good..."** It was not a lie, but she wanted to withhold the entire truth, for both of their sakes. 

Sophie took her hands out of her pockets and fidgeted with the fringed edges of the jacket. **"This man has been helping me stay off the streets until I can reunite with my family, and when they approached him about me, he said he was my father to keep them from taking me. Then, they asked about my mother, and there is no mother in the picture right now, and if they find out that he was lying, then we both will find trouble."**


[3/13/2025 8:33 PM] Noelle
Noelle listens, her eyes narrowing with scrutiny as Sophie speaks. The explanation does little to ease the wariness in her gaze, but something in Sophie‚Äôs tone‚Äîthe careful restraint, the weight behind her words‚Äîkeeps Noelle from immediately shutting the whole thing down.

Her lips press into a thin line, her free hand coming up to rub at the side of her neck as she lets out a slow, heavy breath. **"Oh,"** she mutters, more to herself than to them. **"I think I am seeing what you're talking about."**

Despite her unspoken protest, her stance has shifted, less guarded than before. She‚Äôs still wary, still unsure, but she hasn‚Äôt walked them to the door yet. Something about Sophie‚Äôs explanation‚Äîabout her being separated from her real family, about Kaedues stepping up to keep her safe‚Äînudges at something in Noelle, something unspoken and buried. That, and the favor Kaedues did for her, was monumental at the minimum.

She looked back towards Kaedues for any added details.


[3/13/2025 8:40 PM] Kaedues Staub
*Sophie has Kaedues' attention as she speaks. He takes a lot of conscious effort to take everything she says, and the way she says it, to mind. It was a lot said. Well put, so the dangerous bits weren't disclosed. His eyes glide over to scan, to read Noelle's expression now.*
*(__Some things__ can be fully disclosed here. It may help my case.)*

**"What do you pay for a month's rent in this complex?"** *He asks first. There is only a soft punctuality to the way he asks the question. It's leading to something else.*


[3/13/2025 8:50 PM] Noelle
**"Uhm..Well. Rent has gone up in the last year.. erm."** Noelle brought her hands towards her stomach, twisting and pulling at her fingers. Embarrassed. **"800‚Ç•R a month..."** She said, ashamed of herself for saying it."**


[3/13/2025 9:01 PM] Kaedues Staub
*Kaedues nods subtly, only indicating that he heard her. He chews the gum in his mouth thoughtfully, giving a rhythm to the pacing of it.* **"800.."**

*He blinks, and his eyes refocus on her.* **"Here's the deal, then. I want you to act as if you are this young girl's mother. I want you to do this for two weeks. It may even be shorter, but I can't guarantee that."** *He looks over at Sophie, and then at Noelle again.*

**"There's a few more details, but that is the short story. If you'll do it, I'll pay for 4 months rent."** *Kaedues says. He raises a hand, displaying four fingers as a simple gesture.*


[3/13/2025 9:12 PM] Noelle
Noelle‚Äôs breath hitches slightly, her gaze flicking between Kaedues and Sophie, searching for any sign that this is some kind of joke. But there‚Äôs nothing but solemnity in Kaedues‚Äô posture, in the way he delivers the offer with cool certainty. The weight of it settles on her shoulders, heavy and pressing.

Her fingers curl inward, and she rubs at the inside of her palm with her thumb, a subconscious habit from years of weighing bad decisions against worse ones. **"Four months of rent,"** she echoes, almost as if she needs to hear it aloud to believe it. **"That‚Äôs more than a favor; that‚Äôs a  __contract__."**

Her lips purse, her mind whirling. She wasn‚Äôt naive‚Äîthis wasn‚Äôt just about playing pretend. Whatever heat Kaedues had gotten himself into was severe enough for him to need a contingency plan. But at the same time‚Ä¶ Four months of rent. It was enough to keep her afloat and ease the constant strain of the departure of her... mistake.

It was the streets in a week or having a cushion for four months. All she had to do was play pretend... **"Alright.."** She says, drawing out the word as she pieces together her conditions. **"I assume there is a...element of danger to this. Otherwise, you would not be putting forth so much money. If the lawmen come knocking on my door with more questions than I can answer, I... I don't know what I could do. I don't have a record. I-I've stayed clean and followed the law. It was that... man that... never mind.. I'll accept."**


[3/13/2025 9:28 PM] Kaedues Staub
*Kaedues crosses his arms. He looks down at the floor and closes his eyes. Considering what she said, there is still something left to be talked about. Maybe it will deliver her even the smallest amount of relief from the weight of the request he is asking.*

**"All the money is sugar. I would be lying if I told you there isn't any danger, but there is almost none to speak of. It's more likely than not that we will reach the end of our deal before anyone confronts you or me."** *Kaedues breathes in deep. The air in his lungs feels heavy now, ill-placed. Letting it out doesn't feel any better.*


[3/13/2025 9:30 PM] Kaedues Staub
**"I told them that we have a split custody situation, which implies a relationship. I have to ask you to play along in public to that detail, also."** *Kaedues rubs his index finger and thumb together habitually. He swallows his gum.*


[3/13/2025 9:46 PM] Noelle
Noelle lets out a slow breath, her gaze drifts between Sophie and Kaedues, lingering a second longer on Sophie as if trying to measure just how deep this situation runs.

**"Sounds reasonable..."**


[3/13/2025 9:46 PM] Sophie Donovan
To help sweeten the idea that it would go smoothly, Sophie pressed as well. **"I am not very adventurous. So, you do not have to worry about where I am."**  She recalled those teenagers in the park and the vending machine. All that was waiting for her out there was trouble. If it wasn't the lawmen, the boys would have mixed reactions to her and the girls would undoubtedly excommunicate her at the sway of a strain of hair.


[3/13/2025 9:46 PM] Noelle
**"Since you mentioned split custody... That means she will frequently be in and out of our places..?."** She is asking more accommodating questions. This is linked to their early successes in easing her tension.


[3/13/2025 9:52 PM] Kaedues Staub
*Kaedues uncrosses his arms, allowing them to fall to his side.* **"The story is, we change her over once a week. But.. it isn't just my decision to make."**

*Kaedues turns to look at Sophie, silently asking for her input.*


[3/13/2025 9:53 PM] Sophie Donovan
The lack of movement in her expression was an early indicator... **"As long as I don't get abducted by strangers, I am indifferent... Besides, you turned out to be alright, I guess."**


[3/13/2025 9:59 PM] Kaedues Staub
**"If that is alright with you, we can play it like that. If it is more convenient to you, one way or another, we can discuss a reason to temporarily ditch the custody arrangement and pose together instead."** *Kaedues explains and returns his eyes to Noelle.*


[3/13/2025 10:00 PM] Kaedues Staub
**"There's a lot I am willing to do as long as you will see my plan out to the end."**


[3/13/2025 10:02 PM] Noelle
The implications of them posing together made Noelle blush. Another man staying in her apartment? No, she wouldn't be emotionally able to do that.  Of course, there was no attachment to Kaedues. But, still. **"I... I just kicked my fianc√© out, and having another man in the house, even for this arrangement, is a bit...overwhelming for me."**


[3/13/2025 10:07 PM] Kaedues Staub
**"Right."** *Kaedues pauses for a long spell. He doesn't know how to react to this kind of admission... but eventually he finds out what to say.*

**"To simplify things.. would you prefer to..."** *Kaedues rubs his chin with an open hand for a moment.* **"No. You'd have to watch over her next week."**


[3/13/2025 10:14 PM] Noelle
**"OK... Well, I should give you my contact then... I never gave that to you when we first met."** And just like that, her information was forwarded to Kaedues!


[3/13/2025 10:35 PM] Kaedues Staub
*Kaedues nods.* **"Thank you.. Noelle."** *He takes a deep breath in. Now is time to leave, since she had agreed to his deal.. but he can't. He feels like he has to say a little more, do just a little more.*

**"I.. I am sorry."** *He pauses. The words feel heavy when they come out.* **"I shouldn't be putting anyone in this situation. If I didn't think it was necessary.."** *Kaedues trails off.. and then shakes his head. He steps back, displacing himself from the situation.* **"Just.. Once this is over,"** *He looks off to the side.* **"I don't forget favors. If you need anything.. just let me know."**


[3/13/2025 11:05 PM] Noelle
Noelle‚Äôs gaze softens, and the tension in her posture loosens just a bit. She watches Kaedues momentarily as if weighing the sincerity behind his words, then exhales quietly. Her fingers, which had been gripping the counter's edge, release as she drops her hands to her sides.

**"You‚Äôre not wrong,"** she finally murmurs. **"This isn‚Äôt something I ever expected to be dragged into. But‚Ä¶ I get it." ** She pauses, then lets out a small sigh. **"And I guess if I were in your position, I‚Äôd be doing the same thing."**

There‚Äôs a brief silence before she adds, softer, **"Please just don‚Äôt make me regret it... Have a good night."**


[3/13/2025 11:12 PM] Kaedues Staub
**"...I won't. Come on, Charlee."** *Kaedues turns to Sophie, nodding to the door.* **"Let's go. I just realized we have somewhere to be."**

*Kaedues blinks and shakes his head as he begins to step away.* **"Oh."**
*He wires 800 micros to Noelle.* **"First two weeks come as they come. The rest will be in bulk at the end."**


[3/13/2025 11:40 PM] Noelle
Noelle would nod in understanding.


[3/13/2025 11:40 PM] Narration
The exited the apartment and stepped out into the cool night. The distant oranges no longer remained in the skies.


[3/13/2025 11:40 PM] Sophie Donovan
Sophie looked curiously in both directions before continuing to the van.


[3/13/2025 11:42 PM] Kaedues Staub
*Once he makes it to the van, Kaedues just sits in the driver's seat. He doesn't start the van, doesn't talk. He looks at his hands.*


[3/13/2025 11:45 PM] Sophie Donovan
She entered the van, looking towards Kaedues curiously. **"...You alright?"**


[3/13/2025 11:56 PM] Narration
A CCR Ion Enforcer was parked in an adjacent parking lot from the apartment complex. The vehicle's lights were turned off to avoid drawing attention.

Inside, the two officers sat in silence. Keeping a watchful eye on the front door. A cold blue glow seeped through the apartment's curtains, shadows occasionally shifting behind the fabric.

**"You think he's telling the truth?"** The second officer who was watching the door finally asked, his voice low. A few moments elapsed, and he looked back at his console. A Geo-locator was pinging off of Kaedues' van. The first officer exhaled, tapping his fingers against the wheel. **"Dunno yet. But we'll find out."**

Minutes passed. The cold night air settled in. Then, movement... **"Hey, check this out."** The second officer alerted, pointing at the house.

The front door creaked open, and Kaedues stepped out, followed closely by Sophie. There was no mistaking it‚Äîthat was the girl, even with the dim streetlight. She glanced over her shoulder left, then right. Then, back towards the apartment, where Noelle gave them a farewell wave, Sophie began walking with Kaedues towards the van.

The first officer straightened slightly, watching as they moved with quiet urgency. **"Guess that answers that."**

**"For now,"** The second one muttered, eyes still locked on the pair. He wasn't convinced yet. The story lined up, but something about it felt too neat, too convenient. If Kaedues was telling the truth, this was just a father and daughter leaving a house together. But if he wasn't, then this was a carefully staged moment‚Äîone designed to make them back off. And the second officer didn't like being played. They needed a big break. With the Vesperian Legion moving in, the CCR needed a big win to stay relevant. **"Let's wait for them to pull off, then we'll head to the station."**


[3/14/2025 12:00 AM] Kaedues Staub
*Kaedues responds quickly. Maybe hastily.*
**"My plan is skewed."** *He says plainly. Softly. His breathing slows a little.*


[3/14/2025 12:01 AM] Sophie Donovan
Buckling her seatbelt, she addressed her question. **"What do you mean? Everything went according to your plan... no?"** She did not understand what his angle was.


[3/14/2025 12:01 AM] Sophie Donovan
**"We got me a 'fake mom', just like you wanted."**


[3/14/2025 12:02 AM] Kaedues Staub
**"Yeah, everything is."** *Kaedues traces his thumb across each of his fingers. The texture of his fingerprints, and lack thereof.*


[3/14/2025 12:02 AM] Kaedues Staub
**"...Once you reunite with your father, my story will be disproven."** *He says it out loud. He doesn't react any further. Just.. looking at his hands.*


[3/14/2025 12:04 AM] Sophie Donovan
Her expression softens with the realization. **"You think those lawmen will watch you for that long?"**


[3/14/2025 12:05 AM] Kaedues Staub
**"They don't need to. They would only need to see me enough times, in the area. Trace back an old story.. and find that you're not in either place."**


[3/14/2025 12:07 AM] Sophie Donovan
**"...I mean, you don't have to stay here in Haven Heights. I am sure once. you know, I get back with my family, and all this gets sorted out, he could help you gain citizenship."** She was being optimistic, that was unlike her.


[3/14/2025 12:10 AM] Kaedues Staub
*Kaedues pauses for a long time. A minute or two. He doesn't say anything during this time. He is thinking to himself, clearly enough. His expression does not change.* **"You're right."** *He responds flatly, and grabs hold of the steering wheel.*

*..Wait.*

*He reaches into his pockets and retrieves his keys, turning them into the ignition. Should do that first.*
*Before he pulls out anywhere, he takes a few deep breaths in any attempt to ground himself.*


[3/14/2025 12:13 AM] Sophie Donovan
She takes his curt and punctual responses as a memo to shut up. She turned back towards the front and sunk back into the seat. **"..."**


[3/14/2025 12:21 AM] Kaedues Staub
*He grips the steering wheel. Somehow, using an appropriate amount of force feels like it takes everything he has. It feels like an impossible task. Actually.. everything does. Listening to Sophie, or even paying attention to her.. Accounting for what mannerisms he should employ to appear fatherly, while doing that.. Figuring out how to show up to work while that happens..*

*And of course, now he would need to plan ahead for the six foot hole he dug himself.*
*He looks around. Checks his mirrors, and his blind spots in preparation to take off. Then, he looks at an angle out of the driver-side window at something in the distance. In front of the car.*
*His eyes glue left, though, at a silhouette across the street. They hang there for a moment before..*

*..the van pulls away from Noelle's place.*


[3/14/2025 12:25 AM] Kaedues Staub·ûµ
*He purses his lips.* **"How old are you?"** *He asks. There's a very, very faint tension in his voice.*


[3/14/2025 12:27 AM] Sophie Donovan
**"Uhm, I am 16. Turning 17 in a month."** She answered, keeping her eyes forward.


[3/14/2025 12:27 AM] Kaedues Staub
**"How do you spell Charlee?"** *He follows up promptly.*


[3/14/2025 12:28 AM] Sophie Donovan
**"C-h-a-r-l-e-e."**


[3/14/2025 12:31 AM] Kaedues Staub
**"Thank you."**
*He immediately proceeds to shoot Noelle a text message.*
`She's 16, turning 17 in a month. Call her Charlee Staub.`
`I am 26. Kaedues Staub. Delete this message once you get it. Thank you.`


[3/14/2025 8:43 PM] Noelle
She sent two messages after a short time. 
`"Got it."`
 
`"Thanks."`


[3/14/2025 8:51 PM] Narration
Inside the Enforcer, the first officer watched the van disappear into the night, drumming his fingers lightly against anything he could get his *hands* on. This time, it was the dashboard. **"You *really* think he's worth the time?"** he asked.

The second officer exhaled, watching the van's taillights. **"Maybe. Maybe not. But something about him doesn't sit right. He was too prepared. It's too put together. Usually, people freeze up when we approach'em, but not this one."**

The first officer smirked, shaking his head. **"Or maybe he's just a guy looking out for his kid."**

Officer number two let out a quiet chuckle. **"Maybe. But I'm not a fan of neat stories. And right now, his story is too damn neat."**

A silence settled between them before the first officer leaned back in his seat. **"Alright, so what's next? You want to keep tabs on him?"** the tracker on Kaedues' van updated off the side of his vision. 

The second officer nodded slowly. **"Yeah. But we don't rush it. Got a good feelin' we'll strike big soon."**

With that, their vehicle's headlights turned on, and they pulled off into the night in the opposite direction.


[3/14/2025 9:03 PM] Kaedues Staub
*The drive toward Kaedues' house is quiet. Cold. With the windows down, the chilly air outside brushes along Sophie's shoulders and Kaedues' forearms. The enshrouding darkness is occasionally and routinely cut into by overhead street lamps that wave light through the car in a predictable rhythm.*

*Kaedues feels his chest rising and falling, and his thoughts circling around one.. particular thought. [Or.. it's really a pattern of thoughts, isn't it?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oHdSK43cIf8)*
**"Sophie?"** *He asks, only to get her attention.*

[3/14/2025 9:05 PM] Sophie Donovan
Sophie herself was in deep thought, only to be pulled out at mentioning her name. She turned her head into his direction.


[3/14/2025 9:10 PM] Kaedues Staub
**"A couple days ago, when we went to Kapea.."** *He trails off for a moment. It could be long enough for a better picture, but who is to say?* **"You remember what ha-- What I did?"**
*He swallows. He feels the urge to grip the steering wheel now, just thinking of it.*


[3/14/2025 9:12 PM] Sophie Donovan
**"..."** Her eyes flicked toward and out towards Kaedues' hands. Regarding them before leveling her eyes to his shoulder. **"Mhm.."**


[3/14/2025 9:15 PM] Kaedues Staub
**"Not the yelling. I was angry.. I am angry. I have the right to be. I'm talking about.. after that."** *The long stretch of road ahead creates a visual pattern. Tens of streetlamps all crawl toward the focal point of Kaedues' vision, slowly moving faster until they jump past.*

**"I don't know what that is. It's not the first time that has happened."**


[3/14/2025 9:50 PM] Sophie Donovan
Sophie doesn‚Äôt answer right away. She doesn‚Äôt move, doesn‚Äôt breathe too deep. She just watches Kaedues‚Äîthe way his voice shifts from something almost human to something else. Something colder. Too smooth. Too clinical.

*Not the first time that has happened?*

The thought sticks, *threading* itself into everything she's just witnessed, everything she's been trying to make sense of. It's how his anger flared up violently, then disappeared like it had never been there, like a switch flipped. It's the way he apologized like he was reading from a script, the way he detached from it all, like the rage wasn't even his to begin with.

**"You talk like you're separated from it. Like you're two different people,"** she says, the words slow, measured. Like testing a step before putting her full weight down as to fear of what awaits for her below.

**"But you're not. You're just.."** She trails off, trying to find something that fits. Something that makes sense. She could think all she wanted; that was easy. But putting it into words was difficult. Her eyes settled on the steering wheel, recalling how he gripped it that day.

-# It clicked, sorta maybe.

**"It's like driving, isn't it?"** Her voice gains a bit of certainty. She looks back at him. **"When you drive, you don't think about every little thing, right? You're not telling yourself, 'Turn the wheel this much, press the brake this hard, check the mirror at this exact second.' You just *do* it. It's instinct. And sometimes‚Äîsometimes you'll zone out, and you won't even remember the last few turns you made, but you still *got* there."**

She leans back slightly, shifting against the seat. **"Maybe that's what this is. You get so caught up in whatever you feel that something else takes the wheel for a while. You don't notice it happening‚Äîyou don't even remember all of it, do you? It just happens, and then suddenly, you're back."**

She closed her eyes, taking a deep breath. **"You said it's not the first time. So, how lon


[3/14/2025 9:50 PM] Sophie Donovan
g have you been running on autopilot?"**


[3/14/2025 10:34 PM] Kaedues Staub
*Kaedues listens to Sophie's response, as he feels he should. He didn't expect her to have so much to say, but that isn't a bad thing. Not at all. Somewhere, Kaedues finds he wanted that. From.. someone.*

*It's like driving? Comparing the feeling of losing yourself behind the wheel.. to the __that__ sensation? Like being pulled back into a sleep? Like watching yourself from a distance?*
*He stews on it, or tries to, but the question she asks snips his thread of thought open. He pauses for a moment to allow what she said to really register.*
*(Autopilot..)*

*Kaedues finds himself pressing his thumb against his index finger. He doesn't know why until he feels the pinch, that grieving of pain from the crease in his knuckle.*


[3/14/2025 10:34 PM] Kaedues Staub·ûµ
*`...Oh.`*
*`"How... long?" Kaedues asks to no one in particular, only pondering her question. "I don't know."`*
*`"The coldness.. honestly.. It happened a lot a couple years back. Almost everything I did would make it happen." Kaedues lets go of his pinch so he can focus on driving. To ground himself, he nibbles once on the inside of his bottom lip.`*

*`"Then.. it was like what you described. When I wake up, it's like I am driving." Kaedues explains. "Something else happened after I worked at the shop. Grace."`*


[3/14/2025 10:34 PM] Kaedues Staub·ûµ
*`Kaedues looks over at Sophie, gauging her reaction for a moment. "She talked to me like I was.. worth something. More than that, actually. Special. Exceptional."`*

*`"I went home to think about it, because.. it impacted me. But.. it.. felt like waking up in Hell."`*
*`"Before I realized I had changed, I forgot it had happened at all. I didn't choose that."`*


[3/14/2025 10:52 PM] Kaedues Staub·ûµ
*`Sophie doesn't immediately respond, so he gets to the point. He answered her question sure, but he's not looking for a place to vent to. There's something Kaedues thinks has to be said.`*

*`"I think it's gonna happen again. Actually.. it's kinda happening right now." He speaks casually, especially compared to how he has acted in general around her. "If I tried to explain it to you.. it wouldn't make a lick of sense. Doesn't to me, to be honest."`*

*`Kaedues takes a breath in and out. He looks up at the sky.. not enough to distract himself from the road, though.`*
*`"I.. wanted to tell you not to worry about it, but I think maybe you have already figured all that out."`*
*`"So, thanks. Even when I'm not.." He pauses for a moment. "Ugh, I don't know the words. I can tell you're trying. That's what I am thanking you for." His tone carries a weight of defeat, as if he believes that his point would be missed entirely because the words slipped his mind.`*


[3/14/2025 11:33 PM] Sophie Donovan
Sophie exhales sharply through her nose, not quite a laugh, not quite a sigh. She leans her head back against the seat, rolling her eyes toward the car ceiling before letting her gaze drift back to him.

Sophie considers his words, letting silence fall again, softer this time‚Äîless dense, less suffocating. The quiet hum of the car wheels over the pavement lulls her mind into a gentle drift. Her shoulders subtly droop and her eyes lose their sharp, watchful edge for the second time tonight.

**"You're weird,"** she finally murmurs. Her voice carries no accusation, no harshness‚Äîjust a faint, sleepy observation. It‚Äôs not an insult, not really‚Äîjust a statement, plain and obvious like calling rain wet. It hangs in the air between them, more truthful in its simplicity than anything she's said yet tonight.

Sophie shifts, tucking her hands further into the sleeves of her jacket, her body subtly curling inward. A soft sigh escapes her lips as her head settles more comfortably against the seat, eyes struggling to stay open. After a brief pause, she adds quietly, **"But... thanks. You know, for telling me."**

**"..Sorry. If you're tired, sleep. I'll make sure nothing else happens."**
*It was really that fast. Those signs pointing elsewhere have corrected themselves. Kaedues makes sure the ride to his house is comfortable and quiet where possible.*

*At the next stop, Kaedues scratches an itch in his left shoulder.*
*(I was right, at least.)*
