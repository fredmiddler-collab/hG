[9/21/2024 9:59 PM] Narration
The sun had finally plunged below the horizon within fairview with the contribution of storm clouds devouring its light and the pinnacle of many of the imposing spires that make up Neon Kyrie in the backdrop.

Along with these clouds came the perception that had already plagued the city an hour prior. Prompting pedestrians and communities to seek shelter from the storm. Lightning flashed and thunder rolled throughout the neighborhood that houses an apartment that has been identified as: Cyllus Apartments. The rain began to fall, causing damage to cars and buildings, and forcing residents to remain indoors. The air was thick with chemicals smell, making it difficult to breathe. Because the industrialized Kapea sector was so close to Fairview, acidic rain was common.

"Cyllus Apartments" is a family owned business that began 20 years ago and stood the test of time as the district experienced rapid development in Fairview specifically. Being so close to Haven Heights in proximity, the architecture is older and the residents aren't welcoming, but it is better than being over the wall that separates the two sections of the district.

When you look out the windows, overlooking the streets below, you can see the 20 meter high walls. In terms of describing the dreary sight, it is imposing. The walls are thick and reinforced with steel, and floodlights illuminate every inch of the outside. Guards and sentries are posted regularly, and anyone attempting to breach the walls will be met with fierce resistance.


[9/21/2024 10:35 PM] Narration
After panning from the imposing walls back to the apartment building, the camera stayed fixed on the apartment building. On the third floor, there is a window that is particularly worth taking notice of; Room 304. On the inside, the apartment was inky black and vacant of life, saved by the soft pulsing red hue from the access control card reader. This hue adorned the door frame. Whoever occupied this unit was concerned about security. The contents of the unit are currently unknown to the naked eye.

Lightning from the acidic storm outside illuminated the room briefly. Desaturated tones and shades painted the picture of a unit mostly unused. A set of screens at the corner of one wall and a map of something in particular on an adjacent wall. Then, back to black...


[9/21/2024 10:41 PM] Cole Mercer
*The man in question, who was so concerned about security, was none other than...* 

# __Cole Mercer.__ 

*He stood tall, his rugged, muscular frame draped in a long, dark trench coat. His slicked-back hair blended into the shadows of his coat, while faint scars on his cheek hinted at a life of conflict. His chest, exposed beneath the coat, revealed a strong, scarred torso. He observed the scene before him, looking down through the window. With the blinders slightly parted by his fingers, he gazed down at the streets below, clearly **waiting** for something.*

[9/21/2024 10:57 PM] Narration
It is a miracle that Cole managed to elude CCR protocols, passing into Fairview without detection. If it was anyone else attempting what he did, they would've been iced. Fairview was known for its heavy surveillance and strict enforcement of the CCR's laws. The risk of being identified and apprehended was immense, with drones patrolling the skies and checkpoints at every major intersection. Cole knew that one wrong move could lead to his capture, and the consequences would be dire.

There was a blip coming from a computer behind him. The monitor was turned off to prevent any onlookers from noticing the apartment was inhabited at the time. Will he investigate his computer?


[9/21/2024 11:01 PM] Cole Mercer
*That's right, it was indeed a miracle. Cole knew he had bought himself some time, but __**not enough**__ to waste. The moment the computer blipped, he turned around and hurried over, ready to investigate. Time was ticking, and __**ticking fast.**__*


[9/21/2024 11:16 PM] Narration
Cole interacted with the computer. The monitor flickered to life. Motion, second floor hallway. He was resourceful and with the assistance of a commissioned netrunner, gained access to the building's live CCTV network. The CCR lawmen raided the apartment complex. Cole was correct to be on alert. They searched the building for the unit in question. The air was thick with tension as heavy boots echoed through the hallways beneath him. Faint but certainly there.

 The CCR officers moved methodically, room by room, their voices muted but firm as they communicated through their earpieces. Cole watched the feed closely, noting their positions. Dragging residences out of the rooms and forcing them down to the first floor. They are expecting any door to be a fatal one...

[9/21/2024 11:19 PM] Narration
Motion, adjacent building first floor. CCR Special Forces. The moment he was able to see the muzzle of the first operator, there was a flash from his muzzle and the image went still. They are killing the feeds...

[9/21/2024 11:23 PM] Cole Mercer
*Cole noted every detail he gathered from his computer and chuckled, __a faint smile__ forming on his lips. He had been waiting for them to show up. Noticing how the CCR attempted to kill the feeds, he got up from his chair and moved over to his locked trunk, which he pulled from underneath his bed.*

*As he looked at it, he spotted a small access code keypad on the front. He entered the code, and the moment he opened it, a single thought formed in his mind...*

:t_::o_::n_::j_::g_::h_::t_:    :j_::s_:    :g_::o_::j_::n_::g_:    :t_::o_:    :b_::e_:    :a_:    :m_::o_::n_::g_:    :n_::j_::g_::h_::t_:


[9/21/2024 11:34 PM] Narration
Movement sounds would become more pronounced. The sound of a door opening in a neighboring room could be heard. The confused voices of the residents and then silence followed by thumps. **They are finally here to play.**


[9/21/2024 11:39 PM] CCR Special Operator
**"Bandit Actual, Foxtrot 2 in position of target AFO."** The operative would state, hugging the exterior wall beside the doorframe. His partners lining up behind him and flipping towards the other side to stack up.

> "Bandit Actual copies, Foxtrot 2. continue with execution."
The voice within the operator's head would reply. The operator would turn his helment to the guys behind him and nodded. Then towards the others on the other side of the frame. They are all on the same page on what they should do next. After all, it was the target unit.


[9/21/2024 11:48 PM] Ghost
*He pulled a sleek black tactical suit from the trunk and quickly slipped it on, the material hugging his body snugly. Next, he grabbed a smooth, featureless white mask that concealed his face, leaving only dark eye slits for visibility.

He strapped on utility belts filled with gear, adjusting the pouches for easy access. Each item fell into place as he worked swiftly.

After donning his gear, he pulled out an automatic assault rifle—__the pulse variant__. It was a weapon rarely seen outside the hands of the CCR or certain organizations.

He shoved the trunk to the opposite side, positioning it to face the door, using it as cover to partially shield himself from the impending chaos.

He placed his rifle on the trunk, extending its bipod for stability. The rifle was capable of firing **60** rounds. He then awaited the right moment, his side pistols holstered at both hips.*

[9/21/2024 11:51 PM] CCR Special Operator
With a final nod to the operator on the side of the frame with the handle. The point man would reach for the door. His second man in would prep a flashbang. With that, the point man __touched__ the knob.


[9/21/2024 11:55 PM] Ghost
*The moment the point man touched the knob, all hell broke loose. Ghost began firing from his left side, unleashing **30** rounds into the wall and sweeping his shots across to the opposite side. By the time he finished, his first magazine was empty. He swiftly reloaded with his spare, preparing for the __next__ wave.*

[9/22/2024 12:14 AM] Narration
There was a scene of mayhem in the hallway. Several special forces operatives were immediately shot, tumbling, being thrown or being cut into pieces by the projectile's impact. When the flashbang-user dropped, his flashbang exploded in the hallway. In the hallway, the hallway lights were shot out and short-circuiting as sparks flew and richoeted throughout. The remaining operatives quickly adapted, using their night vision goggles to regain visibility in the darkened corridor. They moved into defensive positions, covering each other as they hunkered down for a fight. 

Some returned fire through the walls blindly. The deafening roar of automatic gunfire echoed through the confined space, mingling with the sharp pops of bullets ricocheting off walls and the harsh crackle of short-circuiting lights. Shouts and commands were barely audible over the cacophony, punctuated by the occasional explosion that shook the entire hallway. The constant clatter of spent shell casings hitting the floor added to the chaotic symphony of the battle.


[9/22/2024 12:20 AM] Ghost
*Ghost remained stationary, refusing to back down or flinch from the chaos he had just unleashed. Thanks to a swift reload, he continued to return fire, unleashing another **60** rounds through the walls to create as much damage and confusion as possible, all while keeping another plan in mind.*

*He knew that staying in the building any longer could seal his ticket to hell, so he had to act fast to wrap up this mess. He had only **two** impact grenades, **one** flashbang, and his trusty pistols with extended magazines.*

*Ghost had dealt with the CCR Special Forces like this before, but this time, __he was prepared.__*


[9/22/2024 12:35 AM] Narration
Smoke and debris filled the room and the hallway. Bringing visibility down to near zero for those who don't got the augmentations that allow for a clear sight picture. Bullets began punching into Ghost's room from different walls. They were flanking from neighboring rooms and firing at various angles. Holes opened up from his left and right.


[9/22/2024 12:57 AM] Ghost
*Things were becoming increasingly heated, and Ghost was more determined than ever to make it out of there. As bullets began to rip through from both sides, he dropped to the ground, crawling toward the door. He realized that his weapon had **overheated**, and he was **out of ammo** for his primary firearm.*

*It was time to push through. He immediately tossed his pulse rifle to the ground and unholstered both sidearms.*

*Activating his cybernetic ability, **Ghostwalk**, he momentarily vanished from sight. With the hallways nearly blacked out and the CCR units busy returning fire from neighboring rooms, he __assessed__ the situation. Was it clear or safe enough to move out using his ability and arsenal?*


[9/22/2024 1:14 AM] Narration
It was not __safe__. There were still surviving special forces in the hallway. It would be safe to say that they would have optics that would __allow__ them to pick up his signature.


[9/22/2024 1:20 AM] Ghost
*Before Ghost even considered opening the door, he took into account the possibility that they had accessed his profile prior to their arrival.*

-# *He thought to himself,* **“Not clear; they likely possess something to counter my cybernetic abilities.”** 

*Ultimately, he made a decision. He grabbed his flashbang, his finger poised to pull the pin the moment he opened the door, then quickly closed it again. He waited for the right signal.*


[9/22/2024 1:28 AM] CCR Special Operator
**"Grenade!"** One of the operatives yelled!


[9/22/2024 1:28 AM] Narration
**FLASH**, light flashed from underneath the doorway and the hundreds of holes that lined the walls. Audible groans could be heard.


[9/22/2024 1:38 AM] Ghost
*Seizing the opportunity, Ghost breached the door, using his feet to kick it down and completely sever it from the doorframe.*

*As the CCR units were momentarily stunned in the hallway, Ghost moved out, extending both arms to the side and firing his dual handguns simultaneously, aiming to take down all the units with clean shots. His pistols were equipped with double-stacked magazines, capable of holding **24** rounds each, for a total of **48**. He fired six shots in both directions.*


[9/23/2024 12:06 AM] Narration
The remaining special forces would crumple before ghost. Their screams echo throughout the hall. As he cleared the hall, a bright light shined through the blinds of his window behind him.

The deadening sound of an engine piercing through the chaotic dinging of spent shells and the crunching of boots.

That sound cannot be mistaken. It was a Gatling gun on a AV.


[9/23/2024 8:14 AM] Ghost
*The bright light was a clear signal for Ghost to move quickly. He **sprinted** down the hallway toward the stairwell, with no time to loot the bodies of the fallen CCR units or check their gear. He would have to make do with his sidearms and limited ammunition.*

*As he ran, he braced himself for the remaining CCR units on the floors below. It was getting tougher. He also knew he couldn’t just walk out the main entrance. But for this? He had a plan. Not one he was particularly **proud** of, but a plan nonetheless.*


[9/24/2024 8:35 PM] Narration
The AV began to tear the apartment down with the gatling guns. It began tearing chunks off the walls. Pieces of the ceiling came crumbling down around him. An electrical fire would begin in one room as the sparks from exposed wires ignited. In the midst of the chaos, the smoke detector would start screeching, its high-pitched alarm adding to the cacophony. https://tenor.com/view/gun-minigun-quad-minigun-quadruple-minigun-anih-gif-14691235838571669330

[9/24/2024 8:42 PM] Ghost
*On the surface, Ghost seemed composed, his face betraying no emotion. **But** beneath that calm exterior, frustration churned. He thought to himself,*

-# **“Fuck. Fuck. Fuck. I need to get to the bottom floor. Fast.”**

*He bolted down the hall, weaving between crumbling debris and dodging the relentless hail of bullets. He moved like a man with **no time** to lose. Spotting an elevator, he quickly dismissed the thought—he wasn’t reckless enough to gamble on that.*

*In this world, there were only two things he could rely on: his mind and his guts. And right now, __he needed both.__*

[9/24/2024 8:46 PM] Narration
Just before he could make it to the stairwell, the hallway above the frame of the door leading to the stairs collapsed. Blocking him from running down the stairs. His exit was blocked. That elevator perhaps is his best bet! There was a single CCR operative that emerged from one of the rooms on the opposite side of the long hallway, staggering about in disoriented confusion. He might be a problem. There was no time to waste, was the CCR operative a big enough threat where he'd need to dispatch of them quickly? Or was securing the elevator down a bigger priority?


[9/24/2024 8:46 PM] Narration
The AV continued to tear through the building relentlessly. His time was short!


[9/24/2024 8:57 PM] Ghost
*Ghost came to a sudden stop, his eyes narrowing beneath the mask as his grip tightened on the handguns. He **hated** the idea, but it turned out the elevator was his only option. He knew the AV had more than enough ammunition to seal his fate if he didn’t act fast.*

*His head snapped to the opposite side, where he **spotted** the disoriented CCR operative. He knew better than to let them slip away—__no obstacles__ could be allowed, especially if they had the potential to become a relentless threat.*

*Raising his right arm, he aimed the handgun directly at the operative’s head and fired **eight rounds**. Leaving ten remaining rounds in the magazine.*

[9/24/2024 9:03 PM] Narration
The operative was saved by the grace of what god remains on this forsaken dump of a world. The round deflected off of his helmet. The operative stumbled backwards, now aware of Ghost's immediate presence and raising his own gun and firing off a shot. Striking Ghost in the left arm, the round penetrated his clothing and a burning sensation could be felt. Nearly knocking the wind out of him. The operator fell back as AV continued to spray without discrimination.


[9/24/2024 9:10 PM] Ghost
*Ghost felt the searing pain in his left arm. **Another slip-up.** Damn it. He couldn't afford to waste any more time. This wasn't good. Not good at all. Getting injured so early was a bad start. His bloodlust had betrayed him, turning his need to tie up loose ends into a costly mistake.*

*He spun around and bolted for the elevator, stumbling as he slammed against the wall inside. Without hesitation, he jabbed the button to close the doors. __What were his options?__*

*Furious, he pounded his right fist against the wall. He was enraged. Beyond enraged.* **FUCK!**


[9/24/2024 9:14 PM] Narration
The elevator was inoperable due to the damage sustained by the building. However, Ghost's weight added to the elevator caused enough stress to the steel cables where it snapped. Sending the elevator falling. The doors swinging open and closed haphazardly as the cabin screeched and grinded against the elevator shaft. Sparks flying until the elevator crashed into the basement. The doors jammed closed. 

The sounds of the AV died down and now it was only the flickering light in the elevator emitting sound. He was alive.


[9/24/2024 9:31 PM] Ghost
*As the elevator crashed into the basement, the jarring impact rattled Ghost to his core, amplifying the pain in his injured arm and sending a fresh wave of pain through him.* 

-# **“Stick...to the fucking plan.”** *he thought bitterly, realising that this setback only deepened his predicament—now trapped underground, the silence that followed the chaos felt suffocating, and he knew he had to act quickly before the CCR units caught up to him.*

*Not to mention, he considered forcing the doors open, but with his injured left arm, he quickly dismissed the idea. His sidearms lay on the ground, so he picked them up, holstering one of them on his left side. Tightening his grip on the sidearm in his right hand, he scanned for any openings or opportunities that might allow him to escape the elevator.*


[9/24/2024 9:35 PM] Narration
There was panel that was partially bent that showed Ghost a fraction of the world outside the elevator. With enough force, he could potentially dislodge it.


[9/24/2024 9:36 PM] Narration
The CCR must think Ghost is a casualty after the AV gun strafe. This should buy him some time before they realize he is not among the dead.


[9/24/2024 9:38 PM] Ghost
*Ghost moved cautiously to the panel, wincing at the sharp pain in his injured arm but pushing through the discomfort. With a heave, he pulled back on the bent panel until it gave way!*


[9/24/2024 9:41 PM] Narration
The panel gave away with a loud snap. Reverberating throughout the basement. The power was long knocked out, giving away to a pitch black void, saved by the sparks flying from the elevator's electronics shorting out.


[9/24/2024 9:45 PM] Ghost
*Unlike his previous mask, this one unfortunately did not have the ability to see through the darkness. He had to utilize the flashlight in his pouch, using his left arm to illuminate the surroundings just to get an idea of the layout. Although using his left arm for limited purposes was still effective, he would have to use it sparingly.*

*It was a tough situation, but he fully intended to make it out alive nonetheless.*


[9/24/2024 10:05 PM] Narration
There was a tremor from the apartment building above. Bringing down small chunks of concrete onto him and the surroundings. A single strafe from the AV really did a number to the integrity of the building. As Ghost navigated his way through the basement. A loud crash could be heard further in the basement. Three flashlights flooded into the basement. They were searching for him.

There were pillars supporting the weight of the apartment. Quick get behind something!

[9/24/2024 10:15 PM] Ghost
*Ghost quickly darted behind a nearby pillar, using it for cover as he prepared for the impending confrontation. He turned off his flashlight before doing so and returned it to his pouch. Reaching for his **boot knife,** he waited for the right moment to strike. However, not wanting to take any chances, he decided to activate his **cybernetic ability.***

*It was evident to him that whoever relied on flashlights was not part of the CCR Special Operatives; otherwise, they would have used their night vision goggles.*

[9/24/2024 10:34 PM] Narration
The crunching of concrete pieces underneath boots inched into the room slowly. Their sounds getting more crisp with each step... It was so quiet that Ghost could hear them steading their breaths, getting ready to squeeze the trigger at a moment's notice.


[9/24/2024 10:39 PM] Ghost
*He steadied his knife, raising it to neck level as he awaited the approach of one of them, inching closer to the pillar where he was concealed. His breath remained silent, and his presence was invisible to the naked eye. Little did they know, they were trapped in a cage—an environment where Ghost thrived.* 

*Darkness? **Check.** Knife? **Check.** Invisibility? **Check.** All that remained was to seize the precise moment...*


[9/24/2024 10:50 PM] Narration
*Crunch* The first lawman was within striking distance!

*Ghost sprang into action, delivering a clean, horizontal slice across the lawman's throat. Using the darkness to his advantage and leveraging his invisibility, he shoved the lawman toward the third operator to distract him. Then, he __lunged__ at the second lawman, knocking him to the ground and attempting to stab him repeatedly in the chest before ultimately aiming for his throat.*

[9/24/2024 11:00 PM] Narration
**"AHH!GHA! HE- HEL-GUGHR!"** The second officer managed to squeak out. The third officer was shoved by the first lawman's body. Preventing him from firing his weapon immediately.


[9/24/2024 11:05 PM] Ghost
*Seizing the opportunity, Ghost drew his arm back and, with a swift motion, drove the knife deep into the third lawman's right eye, the blade penetrating with brutal precision.*


[9/24/2024 11:06 PM] Narration
The lawman managed to get off two shots which went wide before crumpling before Ghost.

[9/24/2024 11:10 PM] Ghost
*Ghost stepped back, wishing they hadn’t fired at all, as it would have kept his presence hidden. But he knew it was only a matter of time before others found out about the commotion. Pressing forward, he realized he had no time to waste; he needed to escape the building and tend to his injuries. The thought crossed his mind... could he reach out to Paige or anyone else for help?*


[9/26/2024 3:15 PM] Ghost
*Before doing anything else, Ghost moved forward. He wasn’t the type to make that kind of call, especially in a situation like this. No matter how detached it seemed, to Ghost, it was just a job—**__a means of survival.__***

*If he were to make a call, it would be strictly business; otherwise,*
# *you’d never hear from him.*
*As he pressed on, he came to a stop, leaning against the wall and scanning left and right to make sure it was safe. **He was going to do it.** He wasn't sure if they were using jammers to block communications, but there was __only one way__ to find out...*

# *He scrolled through his contacts and made the call to __Paige Underwood.__*


[9/27/2024 9:29 PM] Narration
The call would ring for nearly 10 seconds before it was accepted.


[9/27/2024 9:29 PM] Paige
> **"Awfully late to be calling me, choom. Somebody dyin'?"**


[9/27/2024 9:57 PM] Ghost
*Ghost wasted no time and got straight to the point, his voice cold and focused. He stayed on the move as he spoke, grateful to have made contact.*

> **"Cyllus Apartments, Fairview. CCR raid in progress. I'm injured, low on ammo, and need extraction. How soon can you get here?"**


[9/28/2024 6:42 PM] Narration
There was a pause.


[9/28/2024 6:42 PM] Paige
> **"Got a few hiccups with that. Fairview’s a no-go, too hot for me right now now. Also, I’ll need to score some wheels, and that’s gonna take a bit. If you can delta outta Fairview and jack back into Haven Heights, I’ll link up with you somewhere and patch things from there."**


[9/28/2024 6:43 PM] Paige
> **How the hell did you breach Fairview, anyway? They locked that border down tight."**


[9/28/2024 7:11 PM] Ghost
*Ghost pressed his back against the wall, eyes scanning the path ahead. He took a brief moment to assess the situation. Paige wasn’t going to be an option, and he knew it was down to him—**just like always.***

> **"Don’t have time for questions. I'm moving. Still in the fight,"** *he responded, his tone sharp and focused.*


[9/28/2024 7:13 PM] Paige
> **"Just get into Haven Heights and keep me updated with your geo local."**


[9/28/2024 7:14 PM] Paige
> **"I'll find something."**


[9/28/2024 7:17 PM] Ghost
> *He nodded, though Paige wouldn’t be able to see it. He responded curtly,* **"Understood. I'll be in touch."** *With that, he ended the call. Now, what lay ahead of him?*


[9/28/2024 7:24 PM] Narration
Head was the open doors those lawmen taken to get down there in the first place. With the elevator now permanently on the basement level, his only option was to traverse up the stairs. The most recent rounds fired by that lawmen caused a spraying leak to occur from a pipe. Water poured out on to the concrete flooring, mixing with the officers' blood.


[9/28/2024 7:30 PM] Ghost
*Ghost pressed on, drawing his right sidearm. A quick check of the magazine revealed only **10 rounds** left. He had a spare mag in one of his pouches, but it wouldn't be enough to fend off another wave if it came. His other sidearm was still available, but with his left arm injured, it wouldn't be wise to push it. He glanced back at the lawmen he had taken down, then refocused on the path ahead. He knew things were only just beginning.*


[9/28/2024 7:33 PM] Narration
Ghostgaze went up the stairs upon the open hatch that spilled into the backalley. He wasn't immediately at the hatch yet and there was no telling who or what was on the left or right.


[9/28/2024 7:40 PM] Ghost
*He was just a hand away from opening the hatch but **hesitated**. What was stopping them from setting up an ambush in the alley? Ghostgaze tightened his grip on his sidearm, raising it to eye level. The moment that hatch opened, he was ready to engage, prepared to clear the alley in an instant.*


[9/28/2024 7:42 PM] Narration
The hatch opened up and the sounds of siren's and the rain assaulted his senses. The AV flew over the alley, its spotlight missing the basement hatch and ultimately Ghost. The low droning of its engines was deafening before it moved into its circling pattern. 

The Backalley was clear..?


[9/28/2024 7:49 PM] Ghost
*Ghost quickly scanned left and right, noting the AV's missed target. He understood that this oversight wouldn't last long; the AV would likely return soon. He had to ensure the path ahead was **secure** before making his next move.*


[9/28/2024 7:59 PM] Narration
On the left, the alley appeared to be clear... The blaring siren of a Seraph Knight flying down the road. Most certainly reinforcing the depleted CCR forces. Tick tock.... On the right, there were two Ion Enforcer II blocking the alley with no officers in sight. Ghost could go left and find some way to the walls.

Or... He could attempt to hijack one of those Ion Enforcers.


[9/28/2024 8:06 PM] Ghost
*He understood the stakes. After considering his options, he realized that going left could lead to __unexpected obstacles__ later on; reinforcements could be dispatched, leaving him exposed in the open. On the other hand, hijacking one of the vehicles could get him to Haven Heights quickly and allow him to rendezvous with Paige sooner. He **suspected** the vehicles might be equipped with trackers, but he dismissed the thought. There was no time to waste. Without wasting another moment, he rushed toward the Ion Enforcer.*

[9/28/2024 8:34 PM] Narration
Ghostgaze made his way towards the armored vehicle. As he neared them, the field of view of the street widen. Painting a more severe picture. The CCR had the roads blocked off and their peremeters were **LOCKED DOWN**. Had he went the other way without a vehicle, there was no way he was going to get through wall of CCR units holding the block hostage. The vehicle was now within arm's length and its large stature allowed him to be unseen as long as he stayed on the alley's side of the vehicle...


[9/28/2024 8:38 PM] Ghost
*He ensured he remained out of sight as he reached for the vehicle's door, expecting it to be locked. Constantly glancing back and forth, he checked to ensure the alley remained clear. Scanning the streets, he concluded they wouldn’t allow him to escape easily, which was only logical given the situation.*


[9/28/2024 8:40 PM] Narration
Locked, it appeared to be a biometric lock. He'd need some CCR equipment to gain access to the vehicle. He could go back to those downed officers. Or, he could try to lure one to the vehicle.


[9/28/2024 8:44 PM] Ghost
***Damn it!** Ghost anticipated as much. He realized he had no choice but to return to the **downed officers**; it was either that or risk compromising his position by attempting to lure someone. Opting for caution, he quickly made his way back to the basement.*

*As he neared the hatch, he jumped down, skipping the stairs to minimize noise.*


[9/28/2024 9:05 PM] Narration
Ghost would return to the basement where the officers would lay where he left him.


[9/28/2024 9:09 PM] Ghost
*He hurried over to one of the officers, not pausing to consider his next action. With swift efficiency, he holstered his sidearm and unsheathed his boot knife. Dropping to one knee, he seized the officer's right hand and aimed to **sever it**, ensuring that the fingers didn’t become entangled in the blood.*


[9/28/2024 9:12 PM] Narration
Blood down poured from the severed hand and the arm, providing a wet slopping sound as the arm plopped back onto the wet concrete. Now all that was left was to get back to those vehicles.


[9/28/2024 9:19 PM] Ghost
*Most people would feel nauseous at the sight of such brutality, and it certainly wasn’t normal; no sane individual would even consider such an act. __Yet Ghost was far from sane.__ His upbringing and the harsh realities of his work had desensitized him to violence.*

*If anyone witnessed his actions, their reaction would be entirely understandable. Shaking off the weight of that thought, he sprinted back to the hatch, the severed hand in his possession. With his knife holstered and sidearm re-equipped, he paused at the hatch, checking **left** and **right** once more to ensure the area was clear before making his move.*


[9/28/2024 9:20 PM] Narration
It was all clear, for now. The AV was making another pass shortly however...


[9/28/2024 9:26 PM] Ghost
*It had been __**quite some time**__ since the AV had passed. With the block under severe lockdown, it wouldn’t be unreasonable to assume the AV would check the alley again. __After all, he still hadn’t been caught.__ Knowing how cautious and relentless the CCR were, he could be compromised the moment he stepped out; not even his cybernetics would help in this situation. **However,** waiting it out could spell even more trouble. How long had it been since the officers were taken out? Surely, they would be contacted to report their status...*

# *With all that in mind, he bolted out and made his way to the vehicle!*


[9/28/2024 9:31 PM] Narration
Ghost made it back to the Enforcers in time. The AV was now going overhead, but it was on such an angle that the spotlight was not in the path of him hugging the vehicle.


[9/28/2024 9:34 PM] Ghost
*It was proceeding smoothly. Now, he just needed to get some fingerprints on the biometric lock. With a quick glance at the severed hand, he positioned it against the scanner, hoping it would grant him access to the vehicle.*


[9/28/2024 9:40 PM] Narration
The holographic lock switched green and the locks audibly dis-engaged.


[9/28/2024 9:44 PM] Ghost
*He slid into the driver’s seat and fastened his seatbelt, despite holding a severed hand. Hastily, he placed the hand on the passenger seat and holstered his sidearm. As he scanned the vehicle's interior, he assessed his surroundings for any useful equipment or controls that could aid in his escape.*


[9/28/2024 9:54 PM] Narration
There was a kinetic shotgun in a rack just behind the center console. On the dash, was a 20 inch flatscreen with information on the current mission. Their dispatch system, call logs, their units on the ground and around Fairview. A treasure trove of information. If only he had Paige's hacker friend, they could pull __ALL__ the data and make use of it somehow.

The dispatcher's name, the officer names, patrol vehicles, enroute vehicles and the AV's patrol pattern were all shown. Interesting... The vehicle was still on and running. With the severed hand in tow, the system shouldn't lock down any time soon.


[9/28/2024 10:02 PM] Ghost
*Ghost absorbed all the information the vehicle contained. He realized this ride could hold valuable intel, possibly revealing who initiated the raid and identifying the key players behind the scenes. Unfortunately, he __lacked__ the expertise to extract that data effectively. For now, with the engine running, he had a chance to escape. He gently pressed the accelerator, __reversing__ out of the alleyway. The tinted windows would make it difficult for anyone to identify who was operating the vehicle.*

*Getting on the road was just the first step, but what lay ahead besides the wall?*


[9/28/2024 10:16 PM] Narration
As soon as Ghost got onto the road, he could see that another team of CCR Lawmen were crossing the street with rifles. Coordinating their approach to the apartment complex that was now ablaze. The AV's spotlight locked on Ghost's vehicle for a few moments before peeling away. 

Up ahead was a roadblock managed by more lawmen. He could approach the roadblock and hope they'll let him through so he could go to the Fairview checkpoint. Or, he could barrel his way through.


[9/28/2024 10:26 PM] Ghost
*Ghost surveyed the path ahead, taking in his surroundings as he drove closer to the checkpoint at an optimal speed. As he maneuvered, he reached for the kinetic shotgun, placing it securely between the passenger seat and the glove compartment.*

*He turned on the radio, and* **'Here's to You'** began to play—hardly his usual choice of music, but it was on nonetheless. He reached for __a device__ in one of his pouches, ready to use it when absolutely necessary.*

-# *It was all or nothing. The device was a detonator. You can guess where this is heading, right?*

[9/28/2024 10:40 PM] Ghost
*He approached the roadblock in the car, keeping the windows firmly shut. There would be no rolling them down under any circumstances; he needed to create as much distance as possible from the burning building.*

*As he drove farther, his gaze remained fixed on the detonator, hoping that the lawmen would disperse like flies drawn to a carcass. He waited… waited… and waited… until—*

This sudden explosion prompted mixed responses from the CCR. Many took cover, others ran into defensive positions from the now raining debris. Those at the checkpoint would flinch, also taking cover from the now lethal building material projectiles. He could blow right through it, but that might prompt them to become suspicious.


[9/28/2024 10:45 PM] Ghost
*Ghost seized the distraction to accelerate through the checkpoint at __optimal speed__. If he rushed through too quickly, they would likely pursue him.* 

*However, he played it safe __until__ it was no longer feasible. He could blow right through whenever necessary. His right hand hovered near the shotgun, while his injured left arm remained on the steering wheel.*


[9/28/2024 10:48 PM] Narration
The vehicle Ghostgaze was commandeering went through the checkpoint without drawing much suspicion. It was a 3 minute drive to the border checkpoint which was the hardest part. He could ditch the Enforcer somewhere and get through the border how he had before. Or he could attempt to continue fourth with the vehicle...


[9/28/2024 10:54 PM] Ghost
*He pondered deeply, weighing his options as he had the time and distance to consider his next moves. Continuing to drive this car wasn’t a wise choice, especially given the high possibility of it being tracked.*

*As he drove, he searched for an alleyway and eventually found one where he decided to ditch the vehicle. After parking, he ensured he took the kinetic shotgun with him. He wondered if there was anything else he should grab before heading out. Was there anything important he might need?*


[9/28/2024 11:11 PM] Narration
Nothing of immediate usefulness could be found in the Enforcer. All that was valuable was built into the vehicle.


[9/28/2024 11:13 PM] Ghost
*Unfortunately, he had to ditch the vehicle. The shotgun was only a temporary asset; he would carry it with him until he made it to the other side. He left the severed hand in the vehicle and exited, glancing left and right to ensure the alley was clear. Once confirmed, he made his way back to where he had snuck in originally.*


[9/28/2024 11:48 PM] Ghost
*He made his way to a specific dumpster, and beside it was a **manhole**—just large enough for him to squeeze through, though someone like Gavyn would struggle. Placing the shotgun on the ground, he tried lifting the lid, but his injured left arm nearly gave out. His energy was running low; his body was close to its limit.*

*He needed to link up with Paige before it was too late. It was still too early to celebrate. Ghost carefully moved the lid aside and slowly descended, grabbing the shotgun and tossing it down ahead of him. Once inside, he replaced the lid, sealing it back in place. If the shotgun got damaged from the fall—so be it.*
