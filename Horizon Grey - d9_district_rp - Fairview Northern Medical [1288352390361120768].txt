[9/25/2024 12:27 AM] Narration
Danny and Kaedues made their way through the hallways of the hospital in silence for the majority of the traversal. Danny was the first to speak up, perhaps in a bid to simmer his own nerves.


[9/25/2024 12:27 AM] Danny Donovan
**"I haven't seen Fred in a long time. Have I told you he taught me what I know?"** He'd ask.


[9/25/2024 12:35 AM] Kaedues Staub
**`"Today was the day I learned his name. Don't think I've heard you talk about him either."`**

*`Kaedues grimaces.`* **`"...."`**
*`He takes some time to fish something out of his back pocket. A pair of mangled glasses, with the frames missing.`*

**`"Dan.. tell me that she's going to be okay."`** *`Kaedues looks up at Danny as he walks through the hospital hallways with him.`*


[9/25/2024 12:38 AM] Danny Donovan
His lips pressed into a thin line, he didn't know the state in which Grace was currently in either. Before he could even make a choice to either honor the request or go against it, they arrived at the room. The door was closed. **"...Let's hope so."** He said. He stepped up and knocked on the door. His head lowered slightly.


[9/25/2024 12:41 AM] Kaedues Staub
*`Kaedues breathes in deep and holds his breath. He almost can't take the suspense behind the door.`*


[9/25/2024 7:57 PM] Narration
There was a shuffling sound coming from the side of the doors opposite theirs, drowning out the ambient noises from the hospital. The sound was unsettling, adding tension to the already sterile and cold environment. It made the quiet hallways seem even more foreboding. The hospital's usual calm was disrupted, leaving an air of unease hanging thickly in the air.


[9/25/2024 8:01 PM] Narration
Suddenly, the LED device on the recessed doorframe switched from red to green. The door was unlocked. The intricate door components shifted and gave way. Bringing into view an older man with long hair that has more grey than black. Behind those data driven glasses, his light brown eyes regarded the two men. He swallowed, raising his chin slightly as he settled his focus on Danny.


[9/25/2024 8:01 PM] Fred Dawson
**"Well, it's taken you long enough. Whatever you were griping about was of 'high significance'. You told me 20 and it has been 30 minutes. Some things just don't change with you."**


[9/25/2024 8:01 PM] Narration
There's no doubt this is Freddie Dawson. As soon as he opened his mouth, he was condescending. He was clearly infuriated, his voice filled with enmity.


[9/25/2024 8:01 PM] Fred Dawson
He narrowed his eyes to the two men. **"What is so imperative that you had to waste what time I have with my daughter?"**


[9/25/2024 8:05 PM] Danny Donovan
Despite the jabs he was enduring, Danny did not seem to give a damn. **"Let us inside, please. I don't want to talk in a doorway. Aside from that, I take it Grace is... recuperating?"** He asked.


[9/25/2024 8:08 PM] Fred Dawson
Freddie sighed and stepped back to let them pass. He shut the door behind them and sealed it. He looked at Danny with a knowing gaze and said, **"I don't see why you care so much about Grace. You never seemed to care about much else."**


[9/25/2024 8:08 PM] Narration
This prompted Danny to stop in his tracks and engage with Fred. If Kaedues was to continue in the room he could. She was just around the short corridor and to the right...


[9/25/2024 8:33 PM] Kaedues Staub
*`Kaedues steps into the room. The ominous, drowning feeling surrounds his head. Just to know that She is in the room is enough to swell some foreign, grotesque feeling in his stomach. It feels like a pit is forming, like hunger but colder, sharper.`*

*`He looks at Fred. He can't bring himself to make direct eye contact with him. Kaedues feels somewhat transfixed on the notion that this is her father. It makes the pit in his stomach feel larger.`*

*`The shop gopher searches carefully. He soon turns down the short corridor and moves forward. Every step he takes seems to line up with the drums he is hearing in the air, causing the auditory apparition to feel more connected to his reality. It feels like fuses are bursting in Kaedues' head.`*


[9/25/2024 9:57 PM] Narration
As Kaedues rounded the corner, he saw Grace for the first time since the accident had happened. Grace was lying on the bed, her neck immobilized by a rigid cervical collar that kept her head perfectly aligned. A thin, clear nasogastric tube snaked from her nostrils, winding down to a small, portable feeding pump at her bedside. IVs found their way under the blanket she was buried under. Her hair was tied back and a bandage wrapped around her forehead. The sight of these medical devices underscored her severity. 

She was asleep, deeply sedated and no stimulus could wake her. In the aftermath of the accident, she suffered many injuries. But she was **__ALIVE__**


[9/25/2024 10:15 PM] Danny Donovan
**"You know what Fred?"** Danny said, burning holes in Fred. His attention was drawn to more pressing matters than entering the ring with Fred. With a deep sigh, Danny continued. **"The CCR is on the case for me. If they are looking for me, they are looking for you since I've been nothing but an 'upstanding' citizen."**


[9/25/2024 10:23 PM] Kaedues Staub
*`Kaedues walks over towards Grace's bed. He reaches out with both arms, grabbing the shallow rails on one side of the bed frame. The pit in his stomach feels bigger, hungrier. He feels an instinctive desire to pull his eyes away, something that feels particularly disgusting urges him. It urges him to behold the emptiness, to understand it.`*

*`His face softens. There is an uncomfortable moisture in his mouth and throat that he swallows away. His fingers tighten, and then loosen around the frame.`*

*`...He opens his mouth, intending to speak. His lips part, his tongue dances a pattern within his mouth but no sound comes out.`*


[9/25/2024 10:26 PM] Fred Dawson
Fred just looked at him blankly for a moment's time before his eyes relinquished their lock on Danny. Looking off to the side and placing his hands on his hips as he contemplated Danny's warning. **"...Hmph. Makes no sense for them to come looking for us."** He concluded outloud.


[9/25/2024 10:33 PM] Danny Donovan
**"I did not come all the way here for you just to shrug this off! The lawmen are asking about me, harassing people that know me."** Danny pleaded.


[9/25/2024 10:36 PM] Narration
Beep... The door unlocked, which prompted both Danny and Fred to look towards the door.


[9/25/2024 10:39 PM] Kaedues Staub
*`Hearing the odd sound, Kaedues turns to look too.`*


[9/25/2024 10:55 PM] Narration
The door opened and without missing a beat a heavily geared man entered with two heavily armed lawmen at his flank. His half-lidded gaze was leveled with the two, his lips slightly parted as he expressionlessly walked to them. Then, betraying that void expression, his eyes lit up and a smile cracked.


[9/25/2024 10:55 PM] Rhett D'arch
**"Fred! Dan! Hey buds! Geez, I came here thinking I would have a chat with Freddie over here, then see you, but I got both of you in one room! I guess I'm the luckiest guy in the world! Fred, how have you been? Dan, how's the family?"** He said, with non-threatening body langauge.


[9/25/2024 11:01 PM] Narration
Both Danny and Fred froze immediately. Fred and Dan exchanged glances. Fred was the first to speak, his voice trembling slightly.


[9/25/2024 11:01 PM] Fred Dawson
**"I'm sorry,"** he said, **"You caught me off guard."**


[9/25/2024 11:01 PM] Rhett D'arch
**"Haha, I bet I did."** His smile faltered for a moment. **"Hand me it.."** He commanded, all that remained was a half-smile. His hand raised as if he was expecting a gift.


[9/25/2024 11:04 PM] Kaedues Staub
*`Kaedues releases his grip from the bed frame. His face turns to look at Fred and Danny. His eyes flick back and forth from them to the newcomer, especially given that such person is armed.`*


[9/25/2024 11:04 PM] Fred Dawson
His eyes darted down to Rhett's feet then back up to his eyes. Slowly reaching into his waist-band and pulling out his handgun. Handing it to Rhett.


[9/25/2024 11:04 PM] Rhett D'arch
He took the hand-gun and looked down at it with only his eyes. Tilting his wrist to expect the gun. **"Nice iron, I should get me one of these. Designed by the man himself."**


[9/25/2024 11:06 PM] Rhett D'arch
**"How's Sophie, Danny? Last I've seen her, she was just a lil one."**


[9/25/2024 11:06 PM] Danny Donovan
**"...She's...Good. She graduates next year.."**


[9/25/2024 11:06 PM] Rhett D'arch
**"DAMN, they grow up so fast!"** He'd exclaim, handing the gun to the guard on his right flank.


[9/25/2024 11:19 PM] Rhett D'arch
**"Unfortunately for you two, we got a issue."** Rhett would gesture for the two men to have a fucking seat. In which they complied. Once Rhett was fully in the room, he took a long look at Kaedues. **"Had no idea you had others with you. Who's this?"** He'd ask without letting Kaedues out of sight.


[9/25/2024 11:20 PM] Danny Donovan
**"That's Kaedues... He- he's cool."** He'd speak quickly.


[9/25/2024 11:28 PM] Kaedues Staub
*`Kaedues looks Rhett in the face. He looks soft, vulnerable. Alarms that Kaedues didn't know were put in place are screaming at him about this person, just going off of his sense alone. Hearing Danny stutter only invites a new feeling, infinitely more hopeless.`*

*`Kaedues' expression begins to slowly harden. Before he can properly comprehend`*  *the chaotic stimulus he is experiencing, a cold wave of calm washes over him. The situation at hand almost seems to summon this feeling-- it comes from outside like a jacket.*

*Kaedues' eyes appear to lose focus, from Rhett's perspective.*


[9/25/2024 11:31 PM] Rhett D'arch
**"Uhuh..."** Rhett will spare him for now. Shifting his focus on the other two. **"I don't come around unless we got a problem. Right? You see Rhett, you're in shit. Deep shit."**


[9/25/2024 11:37 PM] Rhett D'arch
**"I don't like making executive decisions. If I can just say in my cozy estate in Silicon Terrace, then all is well. But that isn't the case right now is it?"** He paced around the room. **"An incident occurred in Haven Heights recently which __someone__ really stirred the oil barrel. I'm fairly certain you both are aware of the lock down."**


[9/25/2024 11:37 PM] Narration
Fred and Danny both nodded.


[9/25/2024 11:37 PM] Rhett D'arch
**"Normally, I don't give a flying fuck who happens to cause a Haven Heights lockdown. But, a particular person decided to come back from the __fucking dead.__"**


[9/25/2024 11:38 PM] Danny Donovan
**"..You don't mean..."**


[9/25/2024 11:38 PM] Rhett D'arch
**"Paige, fucking, Underwood."**


[9/25/2024 11:39 PM] Danny Donovan
His eyes went wide, and he put his head into his hands. Running his fingers through his hair. He was beyond nervous.


[9/25/2024 11:39 PM] Fred Dawson
Fred had his eyes closed, shaking his head slowly.


[9/25/2024 11:42 PM] Kaedues Staub
*Furrowing his brow now. This is really confusing.*
*Kaedues just has to sit back and listen. He looks over at Grace for a second before turning back to Rhett.*

*Paige.. who? The name gives Kaedues a dark-flavored deja vu.*
*(Is this a part of what Danny came here for? Why am I accepted as a bystander to it?)*


[9/25/2024 11:46 PM] Rhett D'arch
**"Now, correct me if I am wrong. We had a fucking deal; Get rid with Mathias and Paige and I would provide you witness protection. I gave you lives, allowed you to have families and keep the CCR from eradicating your pathetic existences. This is how you two repay me? My colleagues already got your boy, Kode."**


[9/25/2024 11:47 PM] Rhett D'arch
**"With Paige still breathing, I am STARING DOWN THE FUCKING BARREL OF MY SUPERIORS!"**


[9/25/2024 11:49 PM] Rhett D'arch
**"There is __NOTHING__ that pisses me off more than being at 'fault'. Because, let's be real. I'm __NEVER__ at fault."**


[9/25/2024 11:49 PM] Rhett D'arch
**"Someone has to take the fault, right?"** He'd spread his arms out to his sides.


[9/25/2024 11:50 PM] Rhett D'arch
**"Yeahh......."**


[9/25/2024 11:50 PM] Rhett D'arch
**"You shits are at fault."**


[9/25/2024 11:51 PM] Rhett D'arch
**"So, I think a lesson is in order."** He'd extend his arm out to his guard who handed Fred's gun back to him.


[9/25/2024 11:53 PM] Rhett D'arch
With the gun now in his possession, he'd aim it at Grace.


[9/25/2024 11:53 PM] Fred Dawson
**"Rhett! Pl-please! There must be a mistake! I-I was certain that they were killed! There is no conceivable way! PLEASE! I'll do anything!"** He slid off the chair and went down to his knees, pleading with Rhett feverously.


[9/25/2024 11:56 PM] Danny Donovan
He couldn't look up. All that was going through his mind was the safety of his family. He would kill Grace without a thought. Then, come after his wife. Then torment his children in front of him... Rhett was that kind of man.


[9/25/2024 11:58 PM] Rhett D'arch
**"Now, how are you going to fix this? Fred? You're a fucking old circuit. You going to find Paige and kill her yourself?"**


[9/25/2024 11:58 PM] Fred Dawson
**"I-I'll Danny!"** He'd quickly turn his head towards Danny. **"Danny, will help me! He doesn't have a choice! Right, Danny?"** He inserted Danny into this out of desperation.


[9/26/2024 12:03 AM] Danny Donovan
**"..."** Danny.exe has shutdown entirely. He just couldn't speak up.


[9/26/2024 12:03 AM] Rhett D'arch
**"Is that so?"** He'd look towards Danny who has not said anything this entire time. **"You have three weeks to find and kill the bitch. Bring me her head and I'll spare your families but, kill you both. If you fuck this up, I'll kill your families and make sure you both live long lives with their deaths on your bloody conscious."**


[9/26/2024 12:04 AM] Rhett D'arch
He'd toss Fred's gun at Fred. It struck him in the chest and clattered against the ground.


[9/26/2024 12:05 AM] Rhett D'arch
**"Good day, gentlemen. I got a snitch to silence."**


[9/26/2024 12:14 AM] Narration
And with that, Rhett left the room. Leaving the occupants be.


[9/26/2024 12:17 AM] Kaedues Staub
*Kaedues clutches his hand slowly. He can't move either. There is something lingering in him that prevents him from speaking up, from acting. The way Rhett talks is intense and commanding.*

*He talked about killing Danny. That's another CCR agent. His experience tells him that he really would have killed Grace. He probably will see to killing Danny.*

*He mentioned killing their families if they fail. Kaedues feels a diverging course of action unfolding. Either Danny comes out of it alive.. or Grace does. That..*

*Kaedues turns to Danny. Without thinking too much about it, he shoots Danny a question.*
**"I'm caught in the cross-fire, right?"**


[9/28/2024 6:56 PM] Danny Donovan
Danny did not immediately respond, focusing on regaining some wit about himself. The weight of the entire district was on his shoulders it felt like. All he could think of was the faces of his daughters just before he left the condo. How was he going to tell his wife? It was an near impossible situation for him to face.

With a shaking exasperation, Danny shook his head slowly as Kaedues's question returned to the forefront of his mind. **"No.."** He managed as he place his hands on his knees, raising from the chair. **"No, you're not... You've done nothing wrong."** Turning his attention to Fred who was working on getting up to his feet himself. **"...I...We'll talk later. I got some things I need to take care of."**


[9/28/2024 6:56 PM] Fred Dawson
Fred returned Danny's gaze, nodding wordlessly to Danny's statement. **"I'll be in touch."**


[9/28/2024 6:56 PM] Danny Donovan
**"Come on Kaedues, let's get going."**


[9/28/2024 8:14 PM] Kaedues Staub
*Kaedues looks down at the floor for a second. His eyes dart between his right hand, and where his left hand was before.*

*His head shakes left and right. He looks up at Danny.*
**"Yeah,"** *he says quickly. The word spilled out of his mouth before he even thought it to exist.*

*If Danny is leaving the room, Kaedues will follow.*


[9/28/2024 8:27 PM] Narration
Danny and Kaedues walked back to his car in silence which was in a parking garage. As they neared the vehicle. An armored car came pulling up to them. The window slowly rolling down to reveal Rhett.


[9/28/2024 8:27 PM] Rhett D'arch
**"One last thing, Dan."**


[9/28/2024 8:30 PM] Rhett D'arch
**"You'll need this."** His eye illuminated. Transferring something to Danny. **"Consider it a parting gift."**


[9/28/2024 8:30 PM] Danny Donovan
Danny just looked at him, his eye also flickering data. **"..."**


[9/28/2024 8:30 PM] Narration
The window to the vehicle rolled up and it peeled away. Accelerating down the ramp of the parking garage.


[9/28/2024 8:33 PM] Kaedues Staub
*Kaedues watches as the vehicle drives away from himself and Danny. He feels something itchy, but not in a way he can scratch*

*He looks over to Danny for a moment in silence before walking towards the passenger seat door of Danny's car.*


[9/28/2024 8:39 PM] Danny Donovan
Danny turned to his vehicle and unlocked it for the both of them. The doors swung open and the large man would sink into the driver seat.


[9/28/2024 8:45 PM] Kaedues Staub
*Kaedues visibly hesitates to enter Danny's car now. After a pause, he falls onto the thick cushions of Danny's passenger seat.*

*The door is closed slowly, making a -thunk- that floods the silent airspace of the car. Kaedues purses his lips together and fastens his seatbelt without looking at it.*


[9/28/2024 9:05 PM] dysplexus
:sideeye:


[9/28/2024 9:08 PM] Danny Donovan
Started the car and made for the road. This time, he turned on the radio. There was no way in hell he was going to drive for 30 minutes in complete silence. He needed his music to escape the reality, even if it was just for half an hour.


[9/28/2024 9:10 PM] Kaedues Staub
*This time, Kaedues speaks up very quickly.*
**"Who are you?"** *he asks plainly, turning his head to look at Danny. Though Danny's eyes have to stay gleud to the road, there is just enough of Kaedues' face in his peripheral to see that he is looking directly at him.*


[9/28/2024 9:11 PM] Kaedues Staub

[9/28/2024 9:16 PM] Danny Donovan
He said flatly, **"I'm a dead man."**


[9/28/2024 9:21 PM] Kaedues Staub
*Kaedues turns his head off to one side and breathes in sharp. He closes his eyes and breathes out.*
**"I gathered that. That person was really clear about what he wants to do and what he would do. That's not--"** *Kaedues' tone becomes aggressive, and he hesitates. He stops himself.* **"--what I was asking you."**

*He turns back towards Danny again.* **"Who __are__ you?"**


[9/28/2024 9:29 PM] Danny Donovan
**"I'm a fucking terrorist, ok!?"** It would be the first time he had ever shouted. A bright red flush covered his face, and his voice cracked as a result of the volume. It was the wind whirling of emotion that expelled itself all at once. 
The music in the vehicle stopped. The onboard AI thought he was trying to speak to it so it prompted. **"I didn't quit—"** He'd jam his finger towards the floating interface on the center console to shut it off. Frustrated that everything was turning out wrong. The vehicle went silent.

Then, they came to a red light which prompted Danny to come to a stop. **"..."**


[9/28/2024 9:35 PM] Kaedues Staub
**"What?"** *There is a dark tinge to Kaedues' response, but it is mostly confusion. Something wells in Kaedues' chest hearing it, and his first instinct is to dismiss the idea. It has to be a cover-up. He has never heard something so asinine.*

*But..*

*Everything that just happened... the police looking, the distress he showed in the house that he covered up so quickly, the drive there-- Kaedues had not thought of it, but it seems very out of character for Danny to have taken his eyes off the road.*

*There was some mention of ratting out back there.. and..*

**"..You were given witness protection."**
*He heard that.* **"....I told you about the police.."** *He is audibly processing the course of events.* **"You took me with you in case they showed up."**


[9/28/2024 9:39 PM] Danny Donovan
Coming down from the apex of his emotions, he had to be square with Kaedues. **"...I __was__... what the CCR would classify as a terrorist. Not anymore, not for a long time at least..."**


[9/28/2024 9:41 PM] Kaedues Staub
**"Who is Paige Underwood?"** *He asks immediately, not even giving his response enough time to simmer in his mind.*


[9/28/2024 9:45 PM] Danny Donovan
**"She is... was the adopted daughter of the organization's leader. She caused the CCR a lot of problems."**


[9/28/2024 9:53 PM] Kaedues Staub
**"..And he wants you and your company to find her.."** *Kaedues pieces it together again. Someone is going to die. It doesn't matter what he does.*

*For a moment.. he is relieved by the idea. People he is accustomed to seeing will die, and more. If he had not joined them, the situation would likely have played out the same. So.. it doesn't matter.*

*The thought conjures a swirling pit inside his stomach not dissimilar from how he felt earlier.*

**"You already decided what you're gonna do."** *His eyes tense a little.* **"You're a parent."**
**"...You ratted this person out?"**


[9/28/2024 9:57 PM] Danny Donovan
**"I had to, Paige was too dangerous. When Rhett approached me, he approached me, Fred, and another choom named Kode. If we stayed, we would've been hacked alive and burned three times over for what she did to those people..."**


[9/28/2024 10:00 PM] Danny Donovan
**"We told him where they could find the organization's headquarters... In exchange, our records were wiped clean and we were vouched for in good standing companies to just blend in... Rhett at the time was more compassionate, more reasonable. Above all, he was honorable... Still is, just in a sick and twisted way."**


[9/28/2024 10:07 PM] Kaedues Staub
**"..You said I wasn't caught in it."** *Kaedues thinks to himself.* *He tightens his balled fist. His nails dig into his skin, but it isn't as uncomfortable as what he is thinking right now.*

**"I heard everything he said. I could shout it in the streets if I wanted to."** *Kaedues thinks to himself.* **"To make you do what he wants, he is threatening the people you have a blood relation with."**

*Kaedues takes a breath in and out.* **"Even though you were given a choice, there really is not one to make. Fred is going to choose the same thing as you are, isn't he?"**


[9/28/2024 10:11 PM] Danny Donovan
Danny simply nodded, going through the now green light.


[9/28/2024 10:14 PM] Kaedues Staub
**"He would have shot her."** *Kaedues says shortly. His tone is a mix of many things.* **"I felt it."**

*Saying it out loud feels.. how does it feel?*

**"He would have shot you."**


[9/28/2024 10:18 PM] Danny Donovan
**"Yeah... He also knows me and Fred are his best bet of getting close to her without any interference. I don't think she even knows we were behind the destruction of Horizon Grey..."**


[9/28/2024 10:21 PM] Kaedues Staub
**"And you don't think I am next? After your three weeks are up, you don't think he will come after me?"** *Kaedues now sounds accusatory, not aggressively so but definitely to an extent that Danny has not heard much of before.*


[9/28/2024 10:25 PM] Danny Donovan
**"No, I know he won't come after you. He gains nothing from killing you. Even if you were to go out and preach what you've heard, the CCR lackys will be the ones to clean up. You mean nothing to him."**

*...There is an ease to Kaedues' mind when he hears Danny say that.*

**"...I hope you're right."** *Kaedues replies. He finally looks at the road in front of them. The tenseness he feels in his body does not leave.*

*Suddenly, he feels chained again. He can move his body, but it feels like there's something out of place. Like he is confined to a room in his head. He can only say so much.*

**"It would be unfair for me to keep you tangled in all of this."** He finally said, his condo coming into view. It was only a matter of a few minutes before they arrived. **"Rhett gave me credentials to get through the lockdown. I'll take you home tomorrow."**

*Good. With what Danny just said, it looks like Kaedues will be able to return to his home and his work as soon as possible. Situations like this usually feel much different though. Usually, the promise of returning to work after mandatory leave or a gap in employment is therapeutic to Kaedues.*

*Right now, the thought of returning home is stirring up the chained feeling, like he is really unable to move or think. It's the same way he felt in the car ride here. It's the same way he felt before the crash.*

*It is missing the simplicity. Kaedues has never been presented with a situation like this. He is not unfamiliar with gross violence and murder, but never like this. Never in a way that makes him feel so.. so what?*

**"..No..."** *He mutters to himself, bringing his hand and wrist together-- wrapping his fingers around the stump.* **"..hold on.."**

*He imagines returning to routine.*

*He places himself mentally in the position of work. He would return to gopher jobs, and someone would likely replace Grace's position, fill the seat she usually sits in. Another senior tech would likely show up to replace Danny's position.*

**"..that's--"** *He closes his eyes and furrows his brow, appearing to be frustrated. Whatever new intern or tech shows up will be taking the position of someone else. It itches the back of Kaedues' brain. He scratches the back of his head.* **"...Fuck."** *Kaedues shakes his head.* **"Fuck! `Fuck!` I can't--"**

*Kaedues breathes in deep.* **"You make it so fucking-- difficult.."** *He says, his voice strained.* **"And you did not do.. anything. Neither did she."** *His knee bounces against his elbow with enough force to gently rock the interior of Danny's car.* **"What you just said sounds like shooting myself in the foot."** *Kaedues describes through a strain in his voice. His voice is sort of raspy, and he occasionally pauses between words before continuing on.*

**"What?"** Danny was perplexed to say the least. **"Kaedues, the more you stick around me, the more involved you'll be in this.. Fucking shit. I want to avoid dragging you any further into this than I already have. I have enough people to worry about man... There is no way I am going to simply drag you around my mess."**


[9/28/2024 11:24 PM] Kaedues Staub
**"Going home. You say it like it's simple. It is."** *He shakes his head.* **"It.. itches me. I have to show up to work tomorrow, but if I do, I get the feeling that I am going to lose my fucking mind."** *Kaedues makes a chopping, vigorous hand gesture.* **"There's no reason. It's just like what happened before I crashed the van."** *Kaedues diverts his eyes from Danny and sneers.* **"Every time I try to describe it. Or invision it. Or even just think about it.. there isn't anything."**

**"And it's so-- so.. __infuriating__, because I fucking __had it__. I know I did. Whatever she asked me, I.."** *He grimaces. His face contorts for a moment and then relaxes-- like he can't spare to think about it.* **"Every time.."**


[9/28/2024 11:38 PM] Danny Donovan
**"Damn it, Kaedues.."** He'd mutter. **"We'll talk about this tomorrow."**


[9/28/2024 11:40 PM] Kaedues Staub
**"Right,"** *He says in agreement. His tone is still all over the place.*
*Kaedues acts on his own and turns the radio back on.*
