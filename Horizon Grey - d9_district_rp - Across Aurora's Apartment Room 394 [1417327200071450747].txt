Across Aurora's Apartment in District 9, on the 3rd floor...


[9/15/2025 10:01 PM] Narration
Cole and Cat made it to their objective location. The apartment building which they decided to conduct surveillance at was fairly large. Able to house more than 500 separate single family households. Room 394, a room condemned due to a crime that had taken place a week ago and the property management haven't bothered to renovate and place the apartment room back on sell. The pair entered from the fire-escape on the back-end of the building considering going through the front would raise concerns with the faculty. Upon entering the room, the air itself seemed to resist them. It was a thick, stagnant presence, a stale cocktail of industrial cleaner and something acridly sweet that clung to the back of the throat. 

Room 394 was not empty; it was violently hollowed. The furniture was a picture of chaos frozen in time. An armchair lay on its side, its solid grey color interrupted by a dark, sprawling stain that had seeped deep into the fibers. Nearby, a floor lamp was bent at an impossible angle, its shade crushed like a paper cup. The ghost of a struggle was etched into the scuff marks on the hardwood floor and a spiderweb of cracks in the plaster of the far wall. Though the body was long gone, the evidence of its final moments remained. A faint, chalky outline, almost invisible on the pale rug, delineated a human form in a posture of final repose. The CCR had been thorough, but they couldn't scrub the violation from the air or erase the dark splatter pattern that marred the walls. This crime would have had happened within the last two weeks.

**"Blegh..."** *Well, this sight was pretty fuckin' depressing, and bad smelling to boot. She had to plug her nose to keep the acrid scent of chemicals from burning her nostrils, which didn't help with the sickly sweet taste in the air. Almost made her wanna barf.*

*Still, it'll do for their recon mission - not like anyone who valued their sense of smell or their lunch would come in here anyways. The chaotic state of the place felt fitting for District 9.*


[9/15/2025 10:11 PM] Cole Mercer
*He moved through the ruined room with care, fingers tight around the duffle bag’s strap as if it were the only thing anchoring him to some kind of purpose. He inspected the upturned furniture, the chalky outline on the rug, the splatter pattern on the wall and the hairline cracks in the plaster for anything the CCR might have missed. For him, every surface was treated like evidence, as he checked under the armchair.*


[9/15/2025 10:12 PM] Narration
*What greeted Cole from underneath the armchair was a cluster of roaches that quickly scattered in all directions.*


[9/15/2025 10:13 PM] Cat Bayes
*For Cat's part, she began scanning the walls, floor and ceiling for any signals that shouldn't be there. The CCR were pretty anal when it came to their surveillance after all, and while it wasn't likely, she'd rather not discover later that the room was bugged.*


[9/15/2025 10:17 PM] Narration
*Despite being thorough, nothing would turn up as the room was being observed and monitored by the CCR. Most of the expensive furniture and electronics have been removed from the place. Most likely, scavengers have come through during lulls in the CCR patrols and picked the place clean. If the room were bugged, the scavs would have taken those too, judging the state of the place.*


[9/15/2025 10:18 PM] Cole Mercer
*He set the duffle down on the windowsill, keeping it within reach. He then nodded toward the ruined interior and said,* **“This room will do.”**


[9/15/2025 10:18 PM] Cat Bayes
*Welp, good enough for her.*

*She turned to Cole, nodding.* **"Room's clean, literally."**


[9/15/2025 10:36 PM] Cole Mercer
*Cole leaned against the wall, crossing his arms as his gaze dropped to the floor. After a long pause, he started, voice calm but direct.* **“How much do we know about the target? Her routines, her lifestyle? Who does she associate with? Any known habits, vulnerabilities, or blind spots? I need a full picture before we make a move. That way we cross out some of the work.”**


[9/15/2025 10:50 PM] Cat Bayes
**"Er..."**

[9/15/2025 11:12 PM] Cat Bayes
*She scratched her head, trying to keep up with the multitude of questions he was bombarding her with. Eventually, she just had to put her hands up.* **"Woah, woah, slow your roll down there, G.I. Joe."** *She scoffed, chuckling in amusement.,*

**"Right, so...Aurora King; also known as QueenlyKing on the net. As you probably already know, she's a widely popular streamer who makes a living playing video games - and also being a mole for that Quincy fuck, apparently."** *She explained, folding her arms as she leaned on the wall adjacent from Cole.* **"Honestly, not surprising considering she's hired me before. Had me gather some data on some pharmaceutical company, though I never got to see the data myself."**

*She paused, racking her brain for more information.* **"Let's see, let's see...uhh... Oh, she's collaborated with some other streamers too. Cipher, GliVortex, ByteRiot, Shadow.eX3, and SeraphChrome are some of the bigger names that come to mind."** *She clicked her tongue, remembering something.* **"Ah yeah, she's got an output too. Gonk by the name of Mason Reed. Not much on him, other than the fact that he's a goody-two shoes CCR officer and wants to save the planet...or some shit like that."**

**"Makes sense though, her dad's a high ranking official in the CCR, if the name of one Commander Jin King rings any bells to ya."** *She brought up rather casually, as if she's heard this info hundreds of times before.* **"Other than that, uh...she usually catches a hike when she wants to take a break from gaming. Goes on walks to get the blood pumping, or so she's told me."**

*He absorbed the information silently, letting each name and detail sink in. He ran a mental tally of the risks…*

> `“It’s going to take a while before we figure out her room number. Just walking down the hall already draws enough attention to warrant caution.”`

*He shifted his weight,* **“Ties to a CCR officer, or just having a father in a high-profile position, means there’s likely eyes on her. Surveillance, friends, maybe even contractors. We can’t assume she’s unguarded.”**

*He exhaled slowly, voice measured.* **“I could leave the building, keep an eye out for an Aurora King exiting the premises, and tail her from a distance. I move quietly, record patterns, rack up intel.”**


[9/15/2025 11:28 PM] Cat Bayes
*Cat nodded, listening to his reasoning with focused intent on the mission.* **"If you can get close enough to her, and keep line of sight without attracting too much attention, I could sneak a bug into her soft. Should allow us to detect any monitoring devices or listen in on nearby CCR comms. Would help to keep us off the radar, too."**


[9/15/2025 11:36 PM] Cole Mercer
*Cole’s eyes narrowed slightly, evaluating the plan before nodding once.* **“If things get dicey in here, grab my submachine gun.”** *He pointed at his duffle bag.* **”You’re going to need more than a revolver to hold your ground against Legionnaires. I’ll keep you updated every step of the way.”** *He paused, voice low,* **”If this run doesn’t prove fruitful, we pull back, __reassess__, and try again. And if the results mirror the first, we adapt.”**


[9/15/2025 11:40 PM] Cat Bayes
*Cat shifted her gaze towards the duffle bag in question, hand lingering over the shape of her revolver outlining her pocket. Matthias had taught her the basics of using an automatic weapon like that - which she actually preferred over the automatic rifle, easier to handle the recoil, but still...just having it there as an option reminded her how __real__ the situation was.*

*Taking a deep breath, she narrowed her eyes on Cole and nodded.* **"Copy that. I'll do some digging on the net and see if I can't locate her apartment."**


[9/15/2025 11:51 PM] Cole Mercer
*Cole gave a quick nod, keeping his expression calm.*

*Without a word, he moved to the window, swinging it open with one hand. In one fluid motion, he vaulted onto the ledge and began his descent.*

*Hands gripping the edges of walls and pipes, he navigated the drop, landing on the pavement below. He paused for a moment to scan the surroundings, ensuring he was clear, before disappearing down the alley like someone who’d done this before.*

 *Cat watched as the certified badass began his descent down the window, like a vigilante from a comic book. Leaning out the open window, she waited until the man was out of sight before closing it once more, and getting to work herself.*

*She moved to the center of the room and sat, crossing her legs like a meditative stance. The first step was to connect herself to the net, and from there she could get to work.*

*Closing her eyes, she activated her Cyberdeck...*

 *The street beyond should have been breathing. Even at this hour, this sector thrummed with the restless energy of the city: the glide of vehicles, the chatter of pedestrians walking under the occasional holographic advertisement, the low thrum of life. Today, a void plagues what seemed to be the entire district.*

*Unlike the alleyways found in Haven Heights and the edges of Jansville, these alleyways were maintained. There weren't any gutterpunks, no juicers waiting for their next stim hit or victim to come sprawling out from the streets that ran perpendicular. It was just him and the alleyway.*

 *As the physical world of Room 394 dissolved, it was replaced by a familiar, exhilarating vertigo. The sensation was not one of sight, but of pure being—a plunge into an ocean of cool, silent data. For a heart-stopping second, there was nothing. Then, light bloomed behind her eyelids.*

*The "ground" beneath her was a placid, obsidian mirror reflecting a starfield of raw data points. Around her grew crystalline shards that chimed softly when she shifted in place. Each node was a custom-built program or a shortcut to a favored system; Player one, ready.*

*Before her, the digital landscape of the immediate area materialized, ready for interaction. From her perspective, she was having an out-of-body experience, seeing the immediate area from a bird's-eye view.*

*__The Apartment Building (The Monolith):__ Directly ahead, the building they occupied was represented as a massive, brutalist tower of black glass. Lines of angry red code crawled over its surface—the building's security protocols, the ICE. Within its dark walls, she could sense hundreds of flickering lights, the personal networks of the residents. Room 394 was a dead spot, a patch of absolute black on the monolith's third floor.*

*__The Data Streams (The River):__ Flowing around the base of the monolith was a shimmering river of public data. These were the unsecured comms, the public transit information, the ambient chatter of the block. She could dip her fingers in and feel the pulse of the neighborhood, sifting through the noise for anything helpful if she so chose.*


[9/16/2025 9:07 PM] Narration
*__The Security Constructs (The Hounds):__ Patrolling the perimeter of the monolith were two sharp-edged constructs of white light. They moved in rigid, predictable patterns, sniffing for unauthorized access. They were simple, automated guard dogs, but they would scream an alarm to the system admin if they detected her.*

*__The Target (The Beacon):__ Across the digital chasm, representing the street below, was the other high-rise. It was a fortress of a different kind, shimmering with the golden light of expensive, corporate-grade security. And deep within that fortress, on a high floor, was a single, protected node that pulsed with a soft, silver luminescence. Aurora.*

*Cole scanned the street, then moved to find a suitable spot to watch the building entrance without being seen. It was a matter of waiting and not getting caught, patience folded into every breath. The atmosphere felt stranger, thinner than the alleys he knew, almost clinical compared with the grime and noise he favoured.*

 *Mercer crossed the threshold and made it into an alleyway. However, details were lurking within the alleyway itself. Set flush into the mortar of the polished finished brick of the opposing building are a series of lenses, three cameras to be exact. They don't have the tell-tale red light of active recording. Instead, they are passive, wide-angle receptors, like feeding a constant stream to a central security hub. The neighborhood is under constant surveillance.*

*To Cole's immediate right, a sleek, stainless-steel panel is set into the wall of the other building. A faint blue light glowed around the seam. Periodically, with a soft hiss of pneumatics. Thick, insulated cables and pipes run the length of both buildings, not a chaotic tangle, but in a ruthlessly organized bundle held by clamps. They hummed with latent power, their surfaces appearing to be cool to the touch.*

*Next, on the building to the left, the ghost of an old, wrought-iron fire escape remains. The structure itself was removed long ago, but the bolt-holes in the brick are still there, like patterned scars. It's a memory of a less-controlled time, a potential hand-hold or foot-hold for anyone desperate enough, but utterly exposed.*
