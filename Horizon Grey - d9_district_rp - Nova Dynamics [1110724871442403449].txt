[5/23/2023 8:34 PM] Narration
Ghostgaze has traveled to Fairview to find Kode. The trip would have taken him a few hours. But even then, it was late so he saved the actual visitation day for the next. With a new day approaching, Ghostgaze left the motel he stayed in and headed to Nova Dynamics. A whole city block was dedicated to the corpo's functions and business operations. Target? The largest building in the area. With renewed vigor, Ghostgaze approached the building, ready to face whatever lay ahead.

He was now approaching the large set of glass doors out front. Suits walking in and out at a steady pace and the very frequent Nomad drone or CCR lawmen patrolling the streets. CCR presence was high.


[5/23/2023 8:39 PM] Ghostgaze
*Ghost stood before the imposing entrance of the Nova Dynamics building, a bastion of corporate power in the heart of Fairview. The sight of suits bustling in and out, accompanied by the constant vigilance of Nomad drones and CCR lawmen, only heightened the tension in the air. He knew he had to proceed with caution.*

*Taking a deep breath, Ghost __adjusted__ his mask, ensuring it was securely in place. His eyes scanned the surroundings, mapping out the best possible approach. He observed the patterns of the CCR patrols, Ghost was well-aware that any misstep could trigger an alarm or draw unwanted attention.*

*With a determined stride, Ghost crossed the threshold of the glass doors, seamlessly blending into the flow of people entering and exiting the building. His sharp senses were on high alert, __ready to react__ to any unforeseen circumstances.*

*As he made his way deeper into the Nova Dynamics building, Ghostgaze couldn't help but feel the weight of the task at hand. This was no ordinary mission. The fate of Kode, as well as the information he held, rested on his shoulders. Ghostgaze steeled his resolve, pushing forward with unwavering determination.*


[5/23/2023 8:41 PM] Narration
Ghost entered the lobby. His target had to be somewhere beyond the lobby. Though there was a security checkpoint ahead with several heavily armed men stationed. Looks like he will have to go through...Or risk trying to evade the protocols.


[5/23/2023 8:48 PM] Ghostgaze
*Ghostgaze carefully assessed the security checkpoint ahead, where a group of heavily armed guards stood watch. While his __instincts__ urged him to find an alternative route and bypass the protocols, he knew that taking such risks could jeopardize his mission. In a scenario like this, blending in and following the normal procedure seemed like the wiser choice.*

*With a calculated stride, Ghostgaze approached the security checkpoint, his demeanour calm and composed.*


[5/23/2023 8:53 PM] Narration
The guards would let the lady in front of him go through. Their eyes locking onto him. Shifting their weapons a bit as his appearance came off as...unusual.


[5/23/2023 8:57 PM] Ghostgaze
*Ghostgaze maintained his composure, even as the guards' attention shifted to him and their gaze intensified. He understood that his appearance, marked by his distinctive mask and overall demeanor, might raise suspicions. However, he had anticipated such reactions and was prepared to handle them with a __calm__ and __cooperative approach.__*

*__Without displaying any signs of resistance or defiance,__ Ghostgaze met the guards' scrutiny with a steady gaze. He made sure to keep his body language __neutral__ and __non-threatening,__ fully aware that any sudden movements or aggressive behaviour could escalate the situation unnecessarily.*

*As the guards adjusted their weapons, Ghostgaze remained still, showing no signs of __agitation__ or __alarm.__ He understood that they were simply adhering to their training and maintaining vigilance in their duty to ensure the security of the building.*


[5/23/2023 9:05 PM] Narration
**"Business?"** One guard would ask.


[5/23/2023 9:08 PM] Ghostgaze
*Ghostgaze maintained his stoic expression as one of the guards inquired about the nature of his visit. Without revealing too much information, he simply responded with a single word,* **"Visiting."**

*His intention was to keep his purpose vague and avoid providing unnecessary details that might arouse suspicion. __By giving a concise response,__ Ghostgaze aimed to maintain a sense of professionalism and keep the interaction as brief as possible.*

*He maintained eye contact with the guard, conveying a sense of confidence and sincerity in his answer. While he understood that additional questions might follow, Ghostgaze was prepared to provide further information __if required,__ while still being cautious not to divulge more than necessary.*


[5/23/2023 9:10 PM] Narration
**"Who? You think we are just going to let you in? Got an appointment with someone? If so, what's their ID and the visitation ID? Weapons? You should know the drill."** The guard wasn't that welcoming, then again...


[5/23/2023 9:15 PM] Ghostgaze
*Ghostgaze maintained his composure in the face of the guard's stern response. Understanding the security protocols, he responded with the name of the person he was visiting, which in this case was __Kode.__*

**"I'm here to see Kode,"** *Ghostgaze stated firmly, his voice carrying an air of calmness. However, when it came to the visitation ID, he admitted,* **"I don't have their visitation ID."**

*Recognizing the importance of complying with security measures, Ghostgaze __cooperated fully__ regarding his weapons. He calmly unholstered his __handgun__ and carefully placed it on the designated tray, followed by his __knife.__ With his hand extended, he offered the items for inspection and confiscation by the guards.*

*By demonstrating his willingness to adhere to the established procedures, Ghostgaze aimed to alleviate any concerns or suspicions the guards might have had. He understood the necessity of such precautions in a high-security environment and was prepared to follow them diligently to __proceed__ with his visit.*


[5/23/2023 9:17 PM] Narration
One of the guards would push forwards, frisking Ghostgaze for any more contraband. The scanner flying over head and scanning him through and through. The second guard would walk beyond the checkpoint on the other side, on the phone with someone.


[5/23/2023 9:23 PM] Narration
The scan passed him and the second guard would eye the first on. **"Kode is letting him through. Must have been a mixup with reservation team."**
Huh... Kode allowed Ghostgaze in?


[5/23/2023 9:23 PM] Narration
With that, the two guards would __fuck off__. Allowing Ghostgaze to proceed.
**"Wing F, Floor 30, Room 10."** The guard would instruct Ghost.


[5/23/2023 9:27 PM] Ghostgaze
*Ghost couldn't help but find it __peculiar__ that Kode had granted him access without any prior knowledge or acquaintance. It was __unusual__ for someone like Kode, who operated within the confines of Nova Dynamics, to allow a stranger to enter their domain so easily. This unexpected gesture __raised questions__ in Ghostgaze's mind, adding an air of mystery to his encounter with Kode.*

*However, he remained focused on his mission and the task at hand. He knew that dwelling on the peculiarities wouldn't serve his purpose. With caution and curiosity, he __proceeded__ to Wing F, pondering the reasons behind Kode's decision while staying prepared for any surprises that awaited him on the thirtieth floor.*


[5/23/2023 9:30 PM] Narration
Ghost approached the room. Upon approaching the room, the door would automatically open for him. Neat!


[5/23/2023 9:31 PM] Ghostgaze
*As Ghostgaze cautiously stepped into the room, his senses heightened and his fists clenched, ready for potential threats.*


[5/23/2023 9:36 PM] Narration
The room was large, a research lab with a full glass wall on one side. Beyond the wall was dozens of robotic arms in a sterile environment with all sorts of instruments attached to them. Looks like some kind of assembly. Sitting in a chair, looking towards the door was Kode.


[5/23/2023 9:36 PM] Kode
**"Interesting choice in attire."** He remarked.

[5/23/2023 9:36 PM] Kode
**"Can't remember the last time I had a __visitor.__"**


[5/23/2023 9:40 PM] Ghostgaze
*Ghostgaze met Kode's remark with a __subtle__ nod, his expression stoic behind his mask. He walked further into the room, the click of his boots on the pristine floor echoing in the space. Without a word, he took a seat __opposite__ Kode, his posture composed and his focus unwavering.*

*The room's atmosphere was charged with intrigue and anticipation. Ghostgaze's eyes briefly scanned the robotic arms beyond the glass wall, recognizing the intricate assembly process taking place.*

*Ghostgaze nodded in acknowledgment of Kode's remark, his eyes still fixed on the man before him.* **__"I can imagine."__**


[5/23/2023 9:42 PM] Kode
**"What brings you here? You certainly look like a unique individual with a unique topic to part with."**


[5/23/2023 9:45 PM] Ghostgaze
*Ghostgaze maintained his focused gaze on Kode, his posture still conveying a sense of readiness and caution. He didn't waste any time with unnecessary pleasantries or beating around the bush.* **"I'm here for information,"** *he replied, his voice steady and unwavering.* **"Specifically, I need to know more about Paige Underwood and her activities. The Horizon Grey faction has caught my attention, and I aim to understand their motivations and objectives."**

*Ghostgaze's words were concise and to the point, reflecting his __no-nonsense approach__ to the conversation. He awaited Kode's response, his demeanor conveying the seriousness of his mission. The room remained quiet, with only the hum of machinery in the background, as the two individuals locked eyes in this crucial exchange.*


[5/23/2023 9:55 PM] Kode
He'd chuckle. **"You're a funny guy."** He would turn in his chair slightly before pressing a button on the console of the terminal nearby.


[5/23/2023 9:55 PM] Narration
The door would close.


[5/23/2023 9:56 PM] Kode
**"Let me guess... You're another one of those Huscles that is looking to cash out on the __bounty__?"**


[5/23/2023 9:58 PM] Ghostgaze
*Ghostgaze's expression remained unchanged as Kode made his guesses. He leaned back slightly in his chair, his posture __relaxed__ yet ready to react at a moment's notice.* **"Money is the last thing that interests me in this case,"** *Ghostgaze replied, his voice steady and unwavering.* **"Paige Underwood is a target of interest for reasons __beyond__ the bounty. I seek information, not just a monetary reward. What can you tell me about her?** *His focus was solely on gaining knowledge and understanding, not on any potential financial gain.*


[5/23/2023 10:03 PM] Kode
**"Well, when you put it like that. Any man would be curious to know what you mean. Working with the CCR is an honor, but I am not quite sure I know anything about this Paige Underwood."**


[5/23/2023 10:10 PM] Ghostgaze
*Ghostgaze's gaze remained fixed on Kode, assessing his response. He understood the need for caution and the hesitance to reveal sensitive information.* **"I can assure you that my interest in Paige Underwood goes __beyond__ my affiliation with the CCR,"** *Ghostgaze explained calmly.* **"If I were truly working for them, they would have approached you long before I did. My sources have indicated a __connection__ between you and Paige, which is why I sought you out. I believe you possess valuable information that could shed light on her. Please, consider the significance of our meeting and the potential impact it may have."**


[5/23/2023 10:18 PM] Kode
**"So tell me, why are you so interested in Paige? She done something special for you? Or is it the fact she was apart of a large movement that you don't comprehend?"**


[5/23/2023 10:24 PM] Ghostgaze
*Ghostgaze maintained his composed demeanour, __neither__ confirming nor denying any personal interest or connection to Paige Underwood or her cause.* **"My reasons for seeking information on Paige Underwood are my own. I approach my work with neutrality, focusing on gathering facts and fulfilling my assigned tasks. Whether she is part of a large movement or not, my purpose is to __understand the situation__ at hand and make informed decisions based on the information I uncover. The bounty on her head is merely a starter for me to pursue this particular assignment. My true aim is to gather relevant details and assess the situation __objectively.__"**


[5/23/2023 10:28 PM] Kode
Unsatisfied with the answer he would shift his head to the other side.**"Those of you who are fervent about firearms tend to fall into two distinct categories. You're either exceptionally vocal and overbearing, or you obsessively veil your identity and intentions, which honestly, is quite tedious."**


[5/23/2023 10:29 PM] Kode
**"I also have my own reasons to not tell you a damn thing. Now you either start entertaining me or you can get out of my lab and follow your meaningless leads. Want my information, you'll play by my rules. Simple as that. Don't be so cryptic now as I am a reasonable man."**


[5/23/2023 10:35 PM] Ghostgaze
*Ghostgaze maintained his composed demeanor, acknowledging Kode's words with a nod.* **"I understand your concerns and desire for caution, Kode. However, it is important to note that my interest in Paige Underwood goes beyond the bounty. While someone else may come after her eventually, my presence here signifies a willingness to explore different perspectives and uncover the truth."**

*He leaned back in his chair, his voice carrying a hint of __sincerity.__* **"I have no personal stake in the money offered for her capture. What I seek is a deeper understanding of the situation and the possibility of finding __common ground.__ If it turns out that Paige and her faction are not as misguided as some claim, I may be __willing__ to extend my hand in offering protection or support, provided it aligns with my own __values__ and __objectives.__"**

*Ghostgaze's words revealed a willingness to compromise his position and consider alternative paths. His neutral expression behind the mask concealed any underlying emotions, leaving the decision in Kode's hands.*


[5/23/2023 10:36 PM] Kode
**"See, that wasn't so hard now was it?"**


[5/23/2023 10:37 PM] Kode
He would deactivate the camera system to the room. 
**"Just so that we don't end up dead by tomorrow morning."**


[5/23/2023 10:37 PM] Ghostgaze
*Ghostgaze maintained his blank expression, offering no visible response to Kode's remark. His face behind the mask remained unreadable, revealing nothing of his thoughts or emotions. He had mastered the art of concealing his reactions, a skill honed through years of navigating treacherous situations.*

[5/23/2023 11:13 PM] Kode
**"Let's stop using her full name for this one. It feels wrong. She wasn't just another person. She was family and still is to me."** He sighs, swinging the chair back and forth slowly. **"Paige joined Horizon as a child. Before that, her father was a um... gambling addict and her mother ran off with some other junkie if I remember correctly. Dad flatlined or something like that."**

His head rested on his hand. **"One of our boys found her stealing food so they knew she either came from a troubled home or didn't have one. Brought her in and she slowly became one of us. Troublemaker at first. I can't tell you how many times she blew something up. Mathias, the leader of Horizon wasn't having it. Straightened her out by giving her real work. Showing her what it meant to be a grey; being held accountable. As time passed, she found her calling working on the group vehicles. As if it were her child, she loved it so much. Every night the greys were out on biz, she always looked to make each AV more survivable, more durable. This is so that her family comes home each time."**

He would take a sip of his water. 
**"Anyway, Paige is harmless unless you fuck her over to reveal the truth. She's too caring to belong in Vespera, but cross her and you'll discover that the sweetest of things can become sour. Despite knowing sometimes you need to get your hands dirty and fuck over someone else to achieve your goals."**

**"Moving on, Horizon Grey was founded by Mathias Wildbourne as a medium to undo Vespera injustices. Give people who did not have a sense of hope a reason to live. Spread truth and wisdom. When the organization grew, so did the questions, the problems. How come people do not know the history of our own world? Why is the year 2262 and we only know approximately 200 years of Vespera? Does it matter? The CCR was not willing to side idly by as a 'terrorist' organization and undo their systematic and carefully orchestrated web of lies."**


[5/23/2023 11:13 PM] Kode
**"Yet, here we are. Living in a utopia...But is this really a utopia? Are you happy? Overjoyed to wake up every day and have some corpo fuck wipe his ass with your hair? Horzion Grey is a group of truth seekers aiming to achieve freedom on all fronts."**


[5/23/2023 11:15 PM] Kode
**"Does that sate your curiosity?"**


[5/24/2023 4:24 PM] Ghostgaze
*Ghostgaze's expression remained stoic as he absorbed Kode's detailed account of Paige's background and the mission of Horizon Grey. While Kode seemed to place great value on sharing this information, Ghostgaze was __not swayed__ by sentimental attachments or ideological causes. His focus remained fixed on the task at hand: __locating Paige.__*

*As Kode finished speaking, Ghostgaze's eyes met his with an unwavering gaze. He didn't offer any words of gratitude or acknowledgment for the shared backstory. Instead, he honed in on the practical aspect, __cutting to the chase.__*

**"Where can I find Paige now?"** *Ghostgaze's voice was __devoid__ of emotion, cold and clinical. He was driven by his own goals, and any personal connection or empathy seemed nonexistent. He understood that the information Kode provided was a means to an end, __a piece of the puzzle__ that would bring him closer to his objective.*

*It didn’t __seem__ that Ghostgaze was invested in the emotional narrative Kode had just shared. Ghostgaze's demeanor reflected a detached observer, someone who saw the world through a lens of __practicality and efficiency.__*

*One would wonder about Ghostgaze's true intentions. What drove him? Was he capable of deception to achieve his goals? Kode had shared valuable information, trusting that Ghostgaze would respect the significance of the cause. But the depths of Ghostgaze's __true motivations__ remained shrouded in mystery, and one couldn't help but question the true extent of his honesty.*


[5/25/2023 5:30 PM] Kode
He'd smirk, **"Would you like to know."** It was not much of a question. **"Happy hunting, kid."**


[5/25/2023 5:42 PM] Ghostgaze
*Ghost maintained his composure, his neutral expression hidden behind the mask as Kode's response resonated in the room. The smirk on Kode's face hinted at a deeper understanding, __as if he knew more than he let on.__ Ghostgaze's silence spoke volumes, a testament to his professional demeanour and his ability to withhold any visible reaction.*

*Without uttering a word, Ghostgaze turned his attention towards the closed door, __waiting patiently__ for Kode to open it once again. His posture remained alert, ready to continue his pursuit. The room felt heavy with unspoken tension, as if a game of secrets was being played out between them.*


[5/25/2023 6:13 PM] Kode
He was taking another drink from his cup. Watching Ghostgaze standing at the door. Gulp...gulp....gulp...gulp...**"Ah.. Oh right."** Finally, he would open the door for the bounty hunter.


[5/25/2023 6:47 PM] Ghostgaze
*Ghostgaze stepped out of the room, his gaze fixed on the door as Kode finally opened it. He __paused__ for a moment, his head tilting slightly to the right, as if __contemplating__ something. In a deep, steady voice, he posed a question to Kode, his tone carrying a weight of purpose.*

**"Any last words for Paige if I do happen to meet her?"**

*The question hung in the air, laden with anticipation. Ghostgaze's inquiry hinted at the possibility of a __confrontation,__ a meeting that could have __far-reaching consequences.__ His voice remained unyielding, revealing __nothing__ of his own intentions or emotions. He sought to extract any final messages or sentiments that Kode might want to convey to Paige, perhaps as a warning of the danger that lay ahead.*


[5/25/2023 6:48 PM] Kode
**"That she owes me 20 Micros."** Setting his cup down.


[5/25/2023 7:09 PM] Ghostgaze
*Ghostgaze's stoic expression remained unchanged as Kode's response reached his ears. The remark about Paige owing him 20 Micros elicited no visible reaction from the bounty hunter. He simply turned away, his gaze shifting towards the exit of the room.*

*As he retraced his steps through the corridors of Nova Dynamics, Ghostgaze's mind whirled with thoughts and considerations. The mention of the __video shop__ that Squeeps had informed him of lingered in his thoughts, a potential lead to further unravel the enigma surrounding Paige. With each step, he calculated his next move, weighing the risks and possibilities that lay ahead.*
