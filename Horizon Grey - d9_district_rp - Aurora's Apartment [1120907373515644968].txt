[6/20/2023 10:57 PM] Narration
Aurora guided her __employee__ to the entrance of her apartment, gesturing for him to step inside first. The moment the door swung open, a warm and inviting aura enveloped them both. The space exuded a comforting and familiar atmosphere, radiating a sense of being truly inhabited.


[6/20/2023 10:57 PM] Aurora King
Aurora slipped into the apartment behind him, her gaze lingering on him warily as she leisurely shut the door. **"The kitchen is to your right. Leak is coming from somewhere underneath the sink."**


[6/20/2023 11:06 PM] Kaedues Staub
**"Alright."** *Kaedues takes a brief look around the place but nothing crazy. He looks back at the door and its handle before moving towards the kitchen. He fiddles with his tool belt while he approaches.*

*The decor in this house is... well, it's lost on Kaedues. There's too much industrial work going onto each and every thing inside this home. What are the couches made of? Is the rug authentic or printed? These kinds of things don't stand out to Kaedues. What does stand out to him is Aurora's sink. He takes a look at it... testing water, looking at the pipes beneath the sink.... Anything obvious?*


[6/20/2023 11:12 PM] Narration
As he twisted the faucet handle, the water sputtered weakly, a noticeable loss in pressure. The sound of trickling water echoed from below, beckoning his investigation. Peering beneath the sink, he discovered the source of the issue—a T-joint connection. The bottom part of the T connector, where it should tightly screw into the main pipe descending into the floor, seemed to have water flowing almost unhindered along its length. Could it be... loose?


[6/20/2023 11:16 PM] Aurora King
Aurora chimed in, **"I gave it a shot, you know, trying to tweak it myself, but it only freaked out even more. My output is stuck grindin' at work, so the next logical move was to hunt down someone who's got the know-how."** Keeping her distance, Aurora positioned herself on the far side of the kitchen, a subtle acknowledgment that she was wary of having an unfamiliar person in her domain.


[6/20/2023 11:18 PM] Kaedues Staub
*Kaedues tries the simple approach and tightens the T-joint connection.* **"You hunted me down? Is that right?"** *he retorts casually; Kaedues' attempt at a joke.*


[6/20/2023 11:29 PM] Aurora King
**"Well, more like someone decided to poke his nose into my conversation. Guess that saved me the trouble of finding someone who won't be drooling all over me. But now I've got the pleasure of inviting you into my apartment, tarnishing my rep for the month, and watching over you because you are some serious hot water."** She cracked a sly smile, indicating she was partially jesting, though her tone retained a serious undertone. 

**"It's different in Haven Heights I bet. No need to worry about the words you say, the optics you sport, or the connections you keep. But in Fairview, it's constant watch, constant scrutiny. If you don't fit the mold, they'll single you out and scorch you like a bunch of pyromaniacs."**


[6/20/2023 11:32 PM] Aurora King
**"That loitering charge they had lined up for you? You were lookin' at a bare minimum of five drekkin' months, no chance of walkin' away from it."**


[6/20/2023 11:41 PM] Narration
The T-connection was simply in need of a tightening. All it required was a simple adjustment, as it seemed that she unintentionally loosened it due to her unfamiliarity with such tasks. Oops!


[6/20/2023 11:48 PM] Kaedues Staub
**"Guess we're gonna call it even."** *Kaedues continues to tighten the T-joint until it is snug. After that, a quarter turn to be safe. He goes to press his fingers to his forehead... but bumps his face with his arm nub.*
*Now Kaedues stands up and looks at the running water.* **"You might need to find something else for me to do."**


[6/20/2023 11:57 PM] Aurora King
Aurora's voice carried a mix of surprise and self-deprecation. **"Oh, wow, you actually did it. Now I feel stupid,"** she admitted, realizing she needed to find additional tasks for Kaedues. It seemed he had effortlessly completed the job in just two minutes. She pondered for a moment, contemplating what she could assign to Kaedues without it intruding too much into her apartment. As Aurora contemplated potential tasks for Kaedues, she suggested, **"If you're up for it, perhaps you could tend to my small balcony garden. If you think you can handle it, that is. Bet you haven't seen a plant before, huh?"** It is true that living natural plants are pretty rare to be found anywhere in District 9. They particularly come with a premium. Most "plant life" is synthetic.


[6/21/2023 1:20 AM] Kaedues Staub
*Kaedues stands up to properly look at Aurora while she thinks to herself.*

**"I've never seen one, no. How do you take care of yours?"** *Kaedues doesn't know how to take care of plants but he does know there's a lot of different kinds. That's about everything he knows, though.*


[6/21/2023 11:20 PM] Aurora King
Aurora stepped away from the frame dividing the living room and kitchen, disappearing from view. **"Follow me. I'll show you."**


[6/21/2023 11:49 PM] Kaedues Staub
*Kaedues follows Aurora through her house. He takes a nice and lengthy look around the area while they walk. For now, Kaedues decides not to talk. There's not much he could say that merits a response anyway.*


[6/22/2023 12:15 AM] Aurora King
Aurora guided Kaedues towards the balcony, where her cherished little garden awaited.


[6/22/2023 12:15 AM] Narration
Aurora's secret oasis on the balcony provided the perfect vantage point to soak in the beauty of Fairview, a tranquil haven that offered respite from the bustling world beyond. 
The door stood ajar, inviting the man to enter, and as he crossed the threshold, a leaf brushed against his forehead. Unbeknownst to him, Aurora had grasped hold of a hose nearby, poised for action.

[6/22/2023 1:03 AM] Kaedues Staub
*Kaedues walks in after Aurora. He ducks a little to evade the stray leaf but gets caught anyway. Kaedues brushes it away with his right arm nub. Kaedues goes ahead and looks at the plants Aurora has in advance.*


[6/22/2023 9:12 PM] Narration
The predominant scent is that of blooming flowers, their perfumes infused with a touch of rarity. It's a subtle yet captivating aroma, carrying notes of delicate petals and hints of sweetness. It was fresh air that would open even a smoker's lungs.


[6/22/2023 9:12 PM] Aurora King
**"I'm not some guru, but I've tapped into the net for a couple of days and got the lowdown on tending these."** She gestured towards the pots by the railing, **"First up, water'em but don't drown'em. Keep the soil moist, but not sopping. Shift them to the shade and give the ones already back there some sun before hydrating. Clocked it— 10 to 15 minutes gets you primo results."**


[6/23/2023 10:58 PM] Kaedues Staub
*Kaedues nods. He takes a moment to engrain Aurora's instruction into his mind which makes him appear distant for a moment or two.*

*Next, Kaedues looks at Aurora again.* **"What else?"**


[6/26/2023 10:13 PM] Aurora King
**"That's it. You do this and you will be paid and then delta. The lawmen will be too jacked up on boredom to keep an eye on the lobby"** She would hand him the hose.


[6/27/2023 4:49 PM] Kaedues Staub
*Kaedues looks puzzled, looking at Aurora. He takes the hose gently at first but tightens his grip after a moment.* **"You want me to water your plants for 14?"** *Working man Kaedues grips the hose he was given. There are so many nozzles on this hose he doesn't even know where to begin. Anyway, back to Aurora.* **"Hold on."** *Kaedues takes a notepad out of his tool belt, then a pen. He holds the hose under his arm and writes his number on the pad; handing it to Aurora.* **"Next time, employ me for longer. I will work under any conditions."**


[6/27/2023 9:34 PM] Aurora King
She rolled her eyes, a bit irritated by his response. **"Look, I hired a pipejockey, figured it'd be an hour-long job, alright My brain isn't wired for pipe work so sorry it was so simple to you."** She glanced downward, her gaze fixated on the archaic material before her. It was a foreign sight, the first encounter with this relic of the past. **"What's that?"**


[6/27/2023 9:52 PM] Kaedues Staub
*Kaedues doesn't really react to Aurora's irritation. He's seen responses like that here and there-- Even in Haven Heights you will find people too lazy to figure out how to do the simplest things. Maybe she has a reason, maybe she doesn't. It does not even dawn on Kaedues.*

*After having been left hanging by Aurora, Kaedues retracts his hand--and the note-- a little. In response to her question, Kaedues rotates his hand and allows the note to hang down between his fingers. He wiggles it around.* **"My number?"** *Kaedues asks. As the words come from his mouth it sounds like he's confused.*


[6/27/2023 9:56 PM] Aurora King
**"I saw your number, I am talking about what you wrote your number on. What is __that__?"**


[6/27/2023 10:02 PM] Kaedues Staub
*Kaedues looks at the note and finds himself dumbstruck. Is this a trick question? Is she fucking with him again? He lowers his hand and the note.* **"Paper?"** *He finds himself asking! The thought that Aurora doesn't know won't cross Kaedues' mind.*


[6/27/2023 10:07 PM] Aurora King
**"That what they call it, huh?"** Her hands found their way to her hips as she regarded the sheet of paper, her head tilting inquisitively. **"Ah... can't recall the last time I laid eyes on real paper. It's been ages since they bothered teaching us about that in school."**

[6/27/2023 10:13 PM] Kaedues Staub
**"You..."** *The words come out before Kaedues can think about what to say.* **"You.... You don't know."** *Kaedues looks at Aurora. She looks normal. She's not bullshitting him right now, she really doesn't know what paper is. He suddenly feels like he's standing in front of a __grade schooler__.* **"You don't know what paper is.."** *Kaedues slowly raises his right hand to his forehead... but he can't place his fingers on his temples.*

*And this time it's kind of annoying. Kaedues takes a breath in through his nose so deep you can hear it.*

[6/27/2023 10:22 PM] Aurora King
Aurora sensed the surging energy emanating from Kaedues, an intensity that pricked at her senses. **"Yeah, so what if I don't know squat about paper? It's a relic of a bygone era, a primitive means of communication unworthy of our advanced society. Who needs that drek anyway? You could've easily transmitted the information directly into my optics. Don't tell me you lack the friggin' firmware for that."** Her words crackled with discontent, her dissatisfaction with the situation palpable.

*As Aurora barks at Kaedues she sees him... looking at her, with an expression that could be frustration, or confusion, or boredom, or mania. He holds this look for longer than he should, and what would normally be a quiet gap in conversation becomes a long, uncomfortable silence.* **"Are you trying to lecture me right now after failing to make a right turn?"**

**"What in the fuck-circuits are you blabbering about?!" Are you talking about the pipes? Screw you, you think you've got me all figured out huh? Like I some picture perfect bitch! Give me a fucking pass. If you weren't as dense as the rest of the dimwits in Haven Heights, maybe just maybe you'd think we could have some common ground!"** 

Aurora's voice laced with a mix of frustration and defiance, she continued without missing a beat. **"You want to play the 'let's insult each other' game, huh? Well, I've got a whole neural net of choice words reserved just for you. I'm not a grubby handed glitchhead. Yeah, you got me when it comes to hand work. It's clear because I hired your dumbass. I am certain my connections are far better than yours chump. Oh and Newsflash, chrome dome, you're just another cog in this broken mac—."** 

When Aurora was about to utter "broken machine," her words caught in her throat. Her defiant demeanor dissolved, replaced by a wave of remorse and concern. Her gaze averted from his. 300 ₥R were wired to him immediately **"I...I'm sorry. I didn't meant that. Forget I said anything. Just leave already why don't you."**


[6/27/2023 11:22 PM] Kaedues Staub
*Kaedues is not visibly effected by any of the name-calling. He looks at Aurora blankly... it's not the first time he's had to deal with something like this. Then, Aurora does something he finds interesting. Someone who so clearly speaks their mind holds back. Not only that, she pays before the job is done. Now that is something.*

*Kaedues casually starts walking over to one of Aurora's plants and starts to water it. He had the nozzle set to soak from earlier since it seemed like the right option. Meanwhile, he pauses...*
**". . . . . ."**

*Then, he puts the hose down for a moment and holds the paper out towards Aurora.* **"Don't assume that I'm mangy and dirty and feeble minded just because I wear a jumpsuit. I'm handing you the paper because I know what I am doing."** *Kaedues pushes it just a little forward towards Aurora again, like he is insisting she take it.* **"And if you think you know what you're doing, you should use it too."**


[6/27/2023 11:37 PM] Aurora King
Her gaze dropped to the railing, then shifted to the innocuous piece of paper in Kaedues' hand. Thoughts raced through her mind at breakneck speed, awareness of the impending consequences sinking in. Her mind raced at lightning speed, anticipating the inevitable repercussions of her slip-up. She knew all too well that even the faintest whisper in the wrong direction could bring ruin upon her and her partner. Dread tightened its grip on her, morphing into a consuming despair that weighed heavy on her heart and turned her stomach upside down. Though, his words spoke true but now was not the time to express that...

With her emotions in disarray, she discreetly reached out for the paper, avoiding direct eye contact, her peripheral vision becoming her ally. **"Make it quick...and get out of here."** she uttered, her voice laden with a sense of urgency and unease. With those words, she turned briskly towards the sliding door, a path between the plants leading back into the apartment, her desire to put distance between herself and Kaedues and perhaps emotionally away from her feelings.


[6/27/2023 11:39 PM] Kaedues Staub
*Kaedues picks up the hose and moves to the next plant. Without missing a beat, and without making eye contact, he responds.* **"Repeat the number to me. Memorize it, and then give it back."** *He's not too shabby. If anything, he's giving the plants a little less than they need... but that's better than drowning them.*


[6/27/2023 11:41 PM] Aurora King
She glanced down at the paper for merely a second before handing it back. **"Here."** Now pushing through the door.


[6/27/2023 11:43 PM] Kaedues Staub
*Kaedues doesn't take the paper. He just looks at Aurora.* **"You missed a step."**

*He's not easing up on the water this time. The plant looks mighty fine. The soil is __saturated__.*


[6/28/2023 12:08 AM] Aurora King
She looked at him her eyes widening with frustration before she relented. Sending a text message through his optics to him, returning the same number that was rewritten down. At the end of the message, read "There."


[6/28/2023 12:12 AM] Kaedues Staub
*Kaedues then takes the paper from Aurora.... and shoves it into his mouth. He uncomfortably... chews... and then swallows the paper. He deletes the text message from his personal logs and moves on to the next plant like nothing happened.* **"I'll be gone once I'm done."** *He would proceed to make quick work of watering the plants. By watching the soil, Kaedues starts to learn how much water does the trick. The last plant he waters is watered well.*


[6/28/2023 12:17 AM] Aurora King
**"...Good.."** Nope, not going to comment on the paper eating she just witnessed. There were words formulating but that would defeat the purpose of her exit!

[1/4/2025 10:00 PM] Narration
By the time Mason got home, it was dead of night. For CCR lawmen in Fairview, taking the vehicle home was acceptable. The rain had subsided by the time the vehicle came to a stop just outside the apartment complex. The streetlights cast a cool, white phosphor glow on the wet pavement, creating shimmering reflections like a mosaic of light. Puddles dotted the sidewalk, and the air was filled with rain-soaked earth scent. 

The last few hours were a blur of activity and confusion. Now, with the light rain, everything seemed still and at peace. The streets were empty, the world was silent, and the cool of night reigned over everything external. At the terminal centered on the center-consoled went into standby mode and the interior lights kicked on, the red interior lights giving enough light so he could check his surroundings on the inside. Finally, he and Rob were off-duty for a good while.


[1/4/2025 10:19 PM] Mason Reed
*Mason stayed in the car for a few seconds, staring at the apartment complex. It was a bit jarring to how just a bit ago he was running away from a high charged bomb in a room full of giant batteries, to sitting just outside a peaceful home. Such is the path of the life he was given, or any CCR officer maybe. He sighed and patted the steering wheel of his car.* 

"Still alive and well..." *With that, he got out of the car and made his way into the apartment complex. Knowing he was just a few feet away from the one thing that gave his life more meaning than he could find himself, made his heart feel even more tense than when he was standing in front of that bomb. Finally, all that long work time would be paid off, from seeing just one thing--*


[1/4/2025 10:35 PM] Narration
Entering the apartment complex and then the apartment itself. He would notice that the lights were still on. On the couch closest to the front door of the apartment Mason would see girlfriend Aurora fast asleep on the couch wearing her nightgown; She was waiting for him until she fell asleep.

Aside from the lights being on, it was quiet. It's been a while since he has been back home. A few months actually. The apartment was clean and well-managed but also __COLD__. The balcony door was slightly open, allowing a chilling breeze to enter the apartment.


[1/4/2025 10:46 PM] Mason Reed
*Once he walked in a large chill went down his spine, since he just came from outside the chill only felt worse than it normally would. After locating where the chill was from his eyes went down to the couch.* "Aww.." *From seeing her sleeping peacefully, especially like **that** he couldn't help but let out a small little gasp.*

*After putting what baggage he brought with him down, he silently walked over to her and lightly poked at her cheek.*


[1/4/2025 10:51 PM] Aurora King
Immediately, she flinched from the poke. Her eyes cracked open and looked around subtly. She didn't even register him being in front of her for a few moments. **"mmmnn.."** When her lids opened more, it was when it hit her. **"Mason."** She muttered, almost in a whimper. She was extremely sleepy. **"Welcome....mmn home."** 

She went to stretch her arms and legs. It was at this time her eyes widened and she curled in a half-ball. **"It's __COLD!__"** She exclaimed, holding herself tightly.


[1/4/2025 11:11 PM] Mason Reed
"Pfft-" *A small chuckle came from Mason from her reaction.* "Ahaha, sorry lemme close that for you." *He went over to the balcony and closed the door. Hopefully that'll stop anymore cold air from getting in, why was it open anyway?*

*Well, that aside. Mason turned back around and made his way back to Aurora.*  "Aurora," *And gave her a hug.* "I've really missed you..."


[1/4/2025 11:19 PM] Aurora King
She hugged him as tightly as she could once she was able to stand. **"Not seeing you for four months is a crime in itself. I was hoping they would allow you to delta out of work at a decent time. Wanted to go out to celebrate."** She nuzzled her head into his chest. **"This will do for now."**


[1/4/2025 11:19 PM] Narration
They remained there for a while before Aurora broke the embrace but kept her hands on his forearms.


[1/4/2025 11:19 PM] Aurora King
**"They really did not want you to clock out, huh?"** She inquired, her hair falling over her one eye. She removed one hand to pull the tresses around her head and tucking it behind her ear.


[1/4/2025 11:34 PM] Mason Reed
"Yeah, it was a busy night... Honestly, that's an understatement." *He went silent for a second before his expression turned back into a calm one.* "That's out of the way though," *He rose his right hand to gently touch her cheek.* "All I want now is to spend my time with you."


[1/4/2025 11:37 PM] Aurora King
Her eyes narrowed and the softest smile graced her lips. **"If I wasn't so tired, I would suggest staying up all night."** She would then yawn, her hand trailing down his arm as she walked past him. **"Take a shower, toss your work bag somewhere and come to bed."**


[1/5/2025 12:00 AM] Mason Reed
"O-Oh...Ok.." *That simple gesture and suggestion almost made his brain short circuit, maybe because of how long it's been since they've seen each other. He picked up his work bag that he dropped next to the couch and was about to head to the shower, but...* "Hmm.." *His attention went back to the balcony door. Once again, that uneasy feeling was brought back, so he went out onto the balcony to check for anything unusual.*


[1/5/2025 12:09 AM] Narration
The balcony was quiet and free of any person(s). The scent of Aurora's balcony nursery flooded his nostrils. The smell of wet dirt and greenery assaulted him. On the table along the wall that seperated the balcony and the apartment was her tools and pottery. Beside an empty pot was a shard. (One you slot into your neural socket behind the neck). Soaked from being in the rain. Aside from that, there was nothing of interest.

".....Huh..." *Guess he was just being weirdly paranoid. Though reasonable, considering what he had to do today.* `("No, no..no more work habits, just relax, Mason...")` *Everything seemed fine, well besides a wet shard. He picked it up and went back inside the apartment, making sure to close the door behind him.*

*He placed the wet shard down on the small table in the middle of the room and finally went off to take his shower. Which hopefully, could clear up his mind from todays events.*


[1/5/2025 1:36 AM] Mason Reed
*After his shower, Mason slipped into some casual clothes, relieved to get rid of the CCR uniforms for now. Entering the room, he found Aurora already fast asleep. It wasn’t surprising, given how late it was, but seeing her peaceful form grounded him in a way nothing else could. He sank into the bed, his mind refusing to rest as the events of the day played back in vivid, haunting detail—the abuser, the bomb… **John**. Each memory clawed at him, but the first incident dug the deepest, leaving him sick to his core just thinking about it.*

*His gaze then drifted to Aurora, her face serene in the soft light of the moon. Something about watching her sleep pulled him from the edge of despair, bringing him back to what mattered at the moment. She wasn’t just a part of his life; she was his __life__. In her, and in the people who made his existence worth living, he found his strength to just..move. For a fleeting moment, all the chaos and anguish faded, leaving only calm. His body, finally surrendering to the weight of everything, gave in to sleep as he stared at Aurora, her presence being his final thought before he was out like a light.*

Sunlight streamed into the bedroom, casting light in Mason's closed eyelids.


[1/5/2025 3:50 AM] Mason Reed
"Mmm..." *Slowly, Mason's eyes opened, adjusting to the daylight. He slightly tossed and turned and eventually, it looked like he was coherent enough.* "Aurora..."


[1/5/2025 2:14 PM] Narration
Mason was met with an empty bed. The blankets and sheets on her side were twisted up, giving the impression she already had gotten up.

Lucky for him, she had not gone far so Mason could hear her voice just on the other side of the bedroom door. She was talking to someone, but he couldn't make out what she was saying exactly.

*With a yawn he swung his feet off the bed and onto the floor. His attention turned to the bedroom door, where he could hear her voice. Curious to what she was saying, he inched a little closer to it, hoping to pick up on what she was talking about.*


[1/5/2025 10:01 PM] Aurora King
**"No, Mason's plugged in at home for the next couple of weeks, maybe three."**
She paused briefly before she began speaking again. Likely giving the person on the other end of her call time to speak. **"Even if I was down for it, the vibe I am getting about the sketch is pretty weak. Let’s hit the brakes and push it to next month, yeah?"**


[1/5/2025 11:11 PM] Mason Reed
"...?" *An eyebrow was raised during her conversation. What was she talking about? "Sketch" "push it to next month", was she planning something?* 

`("Ugh, all this worrying is gonna make my hair go white before I hit 30...")` *He just decided to stay there until she ended the call.*


[1/5/2025 11:27 PM] Aurora King
**"Everything's locked down with the corps already. All I've gotta do is make the rounds, and it’s a breeze, easy micros."** An audiable sigh escaped her lips. **"Yeah, I’ll make sure to hook them in. Got some decker dork in the zone who's slicing the pre-records and splicing those in as we speak. It’s gonna be preem, alright?"**
...
**"Chill out, Dek. You’re overloading your cortex... Just vibe with me on this plan. My aesthetics alone will pull in a cool 30k, easy. I’m like a neon beacon, drawing in the creds. Got my back-drop all in check; the look is on point as always."**
...
**"Nah, I haven’t dialed in with them in a few weeks, what’s the net got you buzzing about?"**
...
**"For real? This soon? Ugh, fine. I’ll zap at him after the stream. Gotta bounce, my beau is about to boot up here soon. Aight, catch you on stream.. Bye."**

Then, the sound of her shuffling her feet across the floor could be heard through the door. She was approaching the bedroom door!

The door slid open, and Aurora peered inside before entering inquisitively.

**"Mason, you're awake."** She presented him with that simple smile he oh so knows of so competently before kneeling on the edge of the bed and crawling across it. When she reached him, she came down to her elbows and rolled so that her head rested on his chest as she gazed up at the ceiling.

**"Slept well?"** She inquired.


[1/6/2025 4:19 AM] Mason Reed
"Uh, actually yeah.. This is the most refreshed I've felt in months..." *He raised his right hand and started to pat her on the head.* "How about you? Have you been doing well while I was gone?"


[1/6/2025 5:19 AM] Aurora King
**"Me? Same software, different update... Not much changes around here in this place. Streaming's spiked by 40% 'cause some halfwits pulled a lockdown. Now, everyone’s glued to their screens, drowning in boredom."**

**"Oh, and we had a leak in the kitchen—total meltdown and..."**

She trailed off as if there was a hole in her train of thought... For a time, her brows knitted together. **"We don't no more... I think I got it fixed."**

[1/9/2025 8:10 PM] Aurora King
She stretched her arms as if touching the ceiling from where she lay. Then, she allowed them to fall over her head, draping them over Mason's midsection.

**"I've been scoping out digs in Silicon Terrace again. I just can't shake the dream of what it would be like there. I could keep streaming, too—no more crowded streets or lowlives to stress over. Checked my account, and I’m 60% there. The closer we get to the cap, the more jittery I am."** Her head turned towards Mason, and the one arm that blocked her view came down to her own abdomen so she could lock eyes with him. There was a look.

**"But... We need to chat, like, really badly. About your work."**

[1/9/2025 10:54 PM] Aurora King
She let out a soft laugh, though it carried a nervous edge, her gaze flickering back to the ceiling as she started off soft. **"Oh, Mason, you're always thinkin' about me. It's sweet, really, btu this isn't about Silicon Terrance..."** She turned so that she was on her eblows, and as she went on, she traced idle circles on his chest with her finger, her voice dropping into a quieter tone. 

**"You ever wonder if you're jacked into the wrong grid? I mean, beyond the badge, the patrols, all the crop-static that comes with it?"** She returned her gaze towards him for a moment.

"Can't say I haven't thought about it," *Mason's eyes briefly strayed from hers, a hint of irritation visible on his face.* "...I can't just stop where I am right now, been in with the CCR ever since I was kid. I also have to account for what my parents put into it... It's hard to view myself anywhere but where I've been 'setup' to be, I guess." 

*It was obvious he didn't want to talk much about the CCR at the moment, but he shook of that feeling and returned his gaze back to Aurora.* "..What brought this on? Are you afraid of me working in such a hazardous field?" *He said playfully.*


[1/9/2025 11:29 PM] Aurora King
She hesitated, her finger stilling mid-circle. **"I’ve been... tuning into the chatter on the comms lately. Don’t ask me how."** A ghost of a smirk flickered across her lips before fading. **"The things I’ve been picking up, Mason, they’re not just static. It’s scary out there. More ambushes. Officers caught in crossfire. Stuff the public never hears about. It’s like the city’s running hot and the circuit breakers are ready to blow.... Last night."** 

She knew?!

She paused, her voice growing quieter. **"Haven Heights. I heard about the factory—how it went up in flames, how everything around it turned to slag. They said it was a bomb, like whoever did it wanted to make sure no one walked away. But you did."** Her eyes searched his face, worry pooling behind her calm demeanor. **"Do you even realize how close you came to being part of that debris field? Mason, if you'd been a second off..."** Her voice wavered, and she closed her eyes for a moment before continuing, her tone soft but firm.

**"If this keeps running like it is... if you keep skating on the edge, what happens to us? To everything we’ve been blueprinting? A life in Silicon Terrace, a zone where we can actually breathe, build some real infrastructure—maybe even start our own little family someday. Away from all this... nonsense."** Her gaze dropped to her hand, resting on his chest like an anchor.

**"I know you’ve got your code written into this system, Mason. I know it’s hardwired into you. But if you keep logging into this chaos, it’s only a matter of time before the next explosion or ambush deletes everything we’ve been working towards."** 

She shifted slightly, propping herself up on her elbow, her eyes sharp but sincere. **"I wouldn’t mind boosting my runtime, pulling extra hours on the streams to close the micros gap. Hell, I’d grind the net every day if it meant you didn’t have to keep slotting yourself into danger. We could reroute, Mason. Rewrite the plan. I know we could."** Her voice softe

"........." *He was silent. There was too much going on his head right now, as this was the one thing he didn't want her to know about. How did she know about this, where did she get the tools—how long could she do this? Mason shifted, slightly sitting up in bed as his eyes darted around, searching for something—anything—to say that might ease her concerns. But the truth weighed heavily: she already knew exactly what he’d been through. And, he already knew how persistent she could get when it came to something like this.*

"...I know," *He said, his voice low.* "You're right about everything you said. About how close I was to death, how I keep getting thrown into this chaos. I can't even give you a valid answer about all of it—why I can't seem to step back. Maybe it's the code, like you said. Maybe it's just...who I am, what I've pushed myself to be."

*He placed a hand over the right side of his face, staring at the blankets for a moment.* "When I'm out there, it doesn't feel like I'm throwing away my life, though. Maybe it's my ego, or the adrenaline, but my main focus out there is on you. I've gotten this far because I think I __can__ do something, at least for the people around me."

*He brought his hand down back on the blanket.* "You're right about something else, too. If I keep going like this, there is a very real chance I could end up losing my life... Not just mine, but *our* life. And I can't lose that, I won't." *Mason's eyes softened as he looked back at her, his hand moving to cover hers.* "You shouldn't have to grind yourself into the ground to keep us afloat, either. I don't want you to be the only one working for our dream."

*He squeezed her hand gently.* "I...I don't know what I'll do regarding staying with the CCR or leaving them, but we'll figure it out. I can't promise I'll flip a switch and just walk away from them tomorrow, it's not that simple. Just...give me sometime, and I'll do something to ease your worries, alright?" *His lips formed i


[1/10/2025 12:49 AM] Mason Reed
nto a faint, weary smile.* "You're the one keeping me stable in all of this. And you're right—we shouldn't just be surviving. We should be living, really *living.* For us, and for our future. Just like you, I want that more than anything."


[1/10/2025 1:18 AM] Aurora King
Her eyes soften to the consistency of butter. His words were filled with thought and consideration, which she needed in that instance. 

**"Thank you."** She said, sitting up. Once she rose and sat on her calves, she went on to say, **"I needed to hear that, more than you know."**

With a final sigh in a bid to stave the tears and emotions away, she changed her tune. **"Aside from that, I wanted to go out with you today. Do something meaningful for both of us. You know, before I have to stream. Get our minds off the dread and look ahead optimistically."**


[1/10/2025 2:17 AM] Mason Reed
"Really?" *Mason's weary smile turned in a full one.* "I'd like that a lot. Did you have anything in mind that you wanted to do?"

[1/10/2025 11:22 PM] Aurora King
She grinned ear to ear before backing up and off the bed. **"Nova! Get dressed. I am going to take a shower and then we can go out asap."** She would then hurry towards the bathroom that was joined to their apartment bedroom. She closed the door and the light came on.


[1/10/2025 11:57 PM] Mason Reed
*His face lit up with a sincere smile as she shut the door. Her happiness was always a pleasure to witness.* "Time to get dressed..." *He got out of bed and went to his drawer full of clothes. He had already taken his shower last night, so that was taken care of. All he had to do now was pick out something nice  and casual to wear.*


[1/12/2025 10:41 PM] Aurora King
Aurora was in the shower for quite a while. If there was one thing, she always took her time. Forty minutes came and went before the sound of running water stopped. Give or take another ten minutes, and she opened the door leading back into the bedroom. Her white platinum hair was wet, sticking to her shoulders and the top of her breasts as she was in the final stages of securing her towel. 

She had left her clothes for the day in the drawer and closest. Once she had mated a pair of underwear and an outfit for the day, she returned to the bathroom to finish up.

...
..
.

She'd emerge in a tank top with thin straps on her shoulders. As an outerwear, she wore a thick jacket to keep her warm against the chills the morning and evening would bring to them. Completing her ensemble was a pair of skinny jeans that hugged her thighs perhaps a bit too much and a pair of white and black sneakers.

**"Deck out and ready to vibe~"** She hit a little pose, winking at Mason in a bid to show off her casual outfit. Her hair was still damp from the shower, but she had a hair clamp that folded her hair. Keeping the wet strains from touching her clothing and neck for the most part.


[1/12/2025 11:30 PM] Mason Reed
*While Aurora was in the shower, Mason used the time to freshen up applying some body products, brushing his teeth, etc. As for clothes he dressed in a dark red parka jacket over a plain black t-shirt and paired it with dark cargo pants that weren't to baggy. To complete the look, he wore the same style of sneakers as Aurora, but in a men’s size, of course.*

*Once she showed up with her outfit Mason couldn't help but give a long stare. To him, she looked beyond perfect. ~~Especially with those jeans on.~~* "...You... look amazing, I'm at a lost for words..." *He was still staring...*


[1/13/2025 6:49 PM] Aurora King
She'd roll her eyes playfully before existing the bedroom. **"We can walk or jack in your wheels, I'm flexible..."** Her voice now softening as she moved further and further away.


[1/13/2025 7:06 PM] Mason Reed
"Depends," *Mason started to follow her out of the bedroom.* "How far away are those events?"


[1/13/2025 7:16 PM] Aurora King
**"About 20 cycles away if we took your crawler."** (20 minutes). She came to a stop at the door and her eyes illuminated, interfacing with the apartment so she could turn off all the lights.


[1/13/2025 7:32 PM] Mason Reed
"Then we can take the truck, it'll save us some time for the day." *Once Aurora turned off the light he went over to the door to open it for her.*

The sun had long set upon the apartment complex of Aurora and Mason. The neon night sky was polluted with the bleeding lights, melting into one another to create a symphony of color. 

It was a peaceful silence that filled the air in the small apartment, broken only by the sound of Aurora's soft breathing as she slept.


[2/3/2025 11:35 PM] Aurora King
Aurora was underneath the comforter—sprawled across the bed, deep in slumber. Her long lashes rested against her cheeks, giving her a serene expression. Aurora's chest rose and fell in a slow rhythm. Her hair was a mess, sprawled out around her like a halo. She had been this way for an hour or so now.


[2/4/2025 12:22 AM] Mason Reed
*Mason was in the living room up a nice cup of sweet tea after a **long** work out of spreading democracy! While Aurora was still resting, he decided to look at the shard he found outside last night. Last time he checked it was still wet from the rain, hopefully it dried off and was safe for inspection.*


[2/4/2025 2:00 PM] Narration
The Shard, is a small metallic device with a sleek, futuristic design. about the width of Mason's thumb and the length of the distance between his knuckle and nail. Its surface is smooth and polished, giving it a reflective sheen that catches the light. The edges are rounded and slightly curved, making it easy to handle and manipulate.

Upon closer inspection, the Shard appears to have a series of intricate etchings running along its surface. These etchings form a complex pattern that resembles a web of interconnected lines and shapes. The etchings are so small and delicate that they can only be seen under close scrutiny, giving the impression that the device is more advanced than it appears at first glance.

The Shard has a single, thin protrusion on one side, which resembles a tiny needle. This protrusion is sharp and pointed, indicating that it is commonly inserted directly behind the ear in his port. *It lacked all branding information, so lord knows what this is.*

*The more he looked at the Shard the more unusual it seemed. There was no brand logo or signs it was __just common shard__, just where did Aurora get this thing anyway? He placed the Shard back down, pondering if he should put it in his port or not.*

`"...Nah, not right now. I'll ask Aurora about it later."` *So, he just left the shard there for now, taking a sip of his tea...* "......" *Is what he wanted, but the urge to put it in his port didn't really leave him.*

The ambient siren of Ion Enforcers filled the air and dissipated almost in a rhythm. Despite the chaos that often filled the streets of Fairview, there were still nights when the city's inhabitants found themselves in the crosshairs of violent crimes like robberies and homicides. If Mason was too curious, he could make their way down to the Ion Enforcer station to listen in on the police scanner or, if they had the right connections, call up someone like Dylan. 

However, Dylan could be the primary dispatcher for whatever transpired, so calling her might pull her away from something important.


[2/4/2025 10:59 PM] Mason Reed
*Mason’s gaze drifted outside as the Ion Enforcers passed by the apartment. He couldn’t help but wonder what his colleagues were up to, but he reminded himself not to slip into ‘work mode’ during his break. Still, a quick glance wouldn’t hurt—just a bit of concern, nothing more.*

"I’ll get back to this later," *He muttered, referring to the Shard, before pushing himself up from the couch. Moving carefully, he stepped into the shared room to grab a jacket, making sure not to disturb Aurora. Once he was ready, he slipped outside and headed toward his Ion Enforcer.*


[2/4/2025 11:09 PM] Narration
In the soft glow of the street lamps, Mason stepped out into the gentle rain. As he approached the sleek black Ion Enforcer II parked underneath one of the lights, the Ion Enforcer's interior lights flickered to life, illuminating the computer interface that was ready for anyone to interact with and connect to the central station.


[2/4/2025 11:47 PM] Mason Reed
*Mason entered his Ion Enforcer and began tapping away at the interface, putting in his login to connect to the central station. Once he was in, he checked for activity that might've been happening tonight.*


[2/5/2025 12:11 AM] Narration
As Mason tapped away at the interface, the central station's dispatch system appeared on the screen, displaying the latest calls and incidents reported across Fairview. Mason quickly entered his login information, connecting him directly to the system.

Suddenly, a red alert popped on the screen, drawing Mason's attention immediately. The message indicated an emergency distress call at his station itself. 

```yml
[Incident Number: EMT-2023-12345]
[Incident Reporter: Dylan Hackett]
[Report Type: Station Panic Button]
[Time Stamped: 12:05 AM Fairview, Fairview Division 4 of Emergency Services]
[Report: Active Shooting, multiple officers down]
```


[2/5/2025 4:19 AM] Mason Reed
**"...What..."** *Mason felt his heart plummet, a sinking weight settling in his gut. The flashing red alert was bad enough, but the details only made it worse with every line he read— ‘Incident Reporter: Dylan Hackett,’ ‘Report Type: Station Panic Button,’ and worst of all— ‘Active Shooting, multiple officers down.’ His hand shot to the top of his head, heat rising beneath his fingertips as his pulse quickened.*

*He’d only been gone for a day—just one damn day—and now his station was under attack? How had things spiraled so fast? His gut twisted at the thought of his friends, his colleagues, thrown into chaos. But one name on the alert made his chest tighten like a vice—*

***Dylan Hackett.*** *She wasn’t just reporting the situation.* ***__She was in the middle of it.__***

**"No, no, no—!"** *His mind spiraled, flashing through every worst-case scenario. Dylan was never built for this—she wasn’t the type to be anywhere near an active shooting, let alone inside the station when it happened! She was supposed to be safe, tucked away in her own little bubble, far from the kind of shit that tore people apart. She wasn't trained for this. Was she hiding? Cornered? Bleeding out? How long had this been going on?*

***Who was still alive?***

# **"DAMNIT!!"**
*He slammed his fist against the steering wheel, his breath nearly ragged. A swirl of rage and confusion danced in Masons mind. Of all the times to mess with __his__ structure, of course—of **course**—it would be when he's not even there to protect it.*

The report had been issued thirty minutes earlier, a significant gap considering the urgency of the situation. The timestamp on the call log and the current time confirmed the delay. The glaring red alert banner that had dominated the screen just moments ago suddenly vanished. Its removal signified only one of two possibilities: either the situation had been successfully contained, or responding units had secured the scene. Whatever had transpired in those crucial minutes, the immediate threat had passed—at least, according to the system.

*It took some time before Mason felt he had regained some sense of calm. Even after the alert disappeared, new questions flooded his mind. Had the threat been neutralized? Had the alert malfunctioned? Or was it merely a diversion? The more he thought on it, the worse his headache became. He leaned back in his chair, hoping to clear his mind.*

"...First the factory now this..." *He pressed two fingers against his forehead.* "......" *The events of the past two days felt undeniably strange. It didn’t help that the CCR had been unusually secretive lately, along with the circulating rumors about possible activity from that one group. Surely all of this was a coincidence, right?*

"Ugh..." *Dwelling on the situation wasn’t going to clear his mind—it only made him feel nauseous. But sitting in the truck, avoiding those thoughts felt nearly impossible. Just as he was about to leave, a nagging feeling in the back of his mind urged him to call Dylan, just in case. So, he did.*


[2/10/2025 5:48 PM] Narration
Dylan's profile picture popped up in the corner of his prepeherial vision. Dylan wasn't much of a social media type of girl and only had a small subnet of pictures she uploaded. The picture Mason had acquired was Dylan posing with her little brother. Their heads were beside one another and the two had some desert smeared across their faces as if they had a food fight. They seemed so happy...

What was not entirely good was the fact she was not picking up. The call rang and rang up until the call dropped. **Recepient Unreachable.** She did not pick up, but her voicemail was still open...


[2/10/2025 5:48 PM] Dylan Hackett
`"You've reached Dylan, sorry I am unavailable right now—please leave a message and I will make sure I get back with you soon."`


[2/10/2025 5:48 PM] Narration
Now, it was up to Mason if he was in the mindspace to leave a message or hang-up entirely.


[2/10/2025 11:13 PM] Mason Reed
". . ." *He was speechless. The last bits of optimism about the situation vanished once the call didn't go through. Mason blinked, listening to her voice. He blinked again, his vision becoming slightly blurry, if only the voice he was hearing was the usual cheerful tone, the **real** one. Once the voicemail finished, he blinked one last time, his blurred vision finally clearing up, leaving behind a trail of streaming tears down his cheeks.*

*He didn't even have the will to leave a message, he just stared at her image in the corner of his vision, letting the message timer reach its limit before the call hung up automatically. He didn't feel like doing much of anything really, he just sat in the car. There was no outburst, or screaming this time. Just cold tears.*


[2/10/2025 11:26 PM] Narration
The muffled sound of city life slowly crept up to Mason. The tinted windshield provided a maroon shade of sunlight, casting shadows throughout the cabin.

He fell asleep in the truck it seemed—he was certainly emotionally drained from the unfolded events the night before. 

People were on their way to work, just another day in Fairview for everyone.


[2/10/2025 11:29 PM] Narration
The MDT read 7:36 in the morning, solidifying any doubts that it was not a new day. Aurora usually slept in later—the likelihood of her knowing that he was out all night was extremely low.


[2/11/2025 10:54 PM] Mason Reed
"Mmm..." *The bright sunlight automatically caused Mason to slightly open his eyes. It took a while for him to notice the difference of this morning, for a couple of seconds he had a moment of peace when it came to what was on his mind. Though, once he registered that he woke up in his truck(?) the events of last night came back to hit him like a truck.*

"Fuck..." *He muttered with a sigh, stretching his arms and rolling his neck, both still stiff from the uncomfortable position he had slept in. His eyes still felt a little puffy, and his overall mood was more than a little sour. He wasn't expecting to fall asleep in his truck, hell he thought last night was just gonna be one of fun. Not whatever that was...*

*Checking the time, he figured Aurora was probably still asleep, meaning he could slip back into the apartment without drawing attention. For once, the last thing he wanted was to linger in his truck any longer, so he quickly got out, wiping his eyes as he walked. The burning sensation in them told him they were still red, but, that would fade soon enough.*


[2/11/2025 11:11 PM] Narration
Mason returned to the silent apartment. The shard he left last night remained on the counter, unattended. In addition to the shard, the holograph projection embedded in the center of the countertop was also present. A few inches above the device, an image of the weather was projected. 20 °C was projected for the day.

The bedroom door was ajar as it was the night before. Aurora __always__ closes the doors around the apartment, just another one of her quirks. Something she acquired when she was living with her parents. They were insufferable, based on her accounts. Always present, always watching...always listening. She resented them greatly. Indeed, she was far happier now that she was freed from that atmosphere.

Dylan never attempted to return Mason's call if he went through his notifications. The best case scenario would be that she was under a lot of stress due to what occurred last night and did not have the time, or she was sleeping. The worst-case scenario did not need any elaboration.


[2/12/2025 2:27 AM] Mason Reed
"..." *Upon walking inside, Mason threw his jacket onto the couch, not really caring on where it went. Judging from the lack of call backs, Dylan was probably tied up with something—yeah that's all it was. He didn't even want to entertain the idea that she might be in trouble, so he didn't. Instead he just tried to focus on her usual routine. She always had a lot on her plate, balancing work and family...that was all.*

*Just as he felt another headache almost coming along, he shook his head and went to close the bedroom door left ajar, and then over to the couch to sit down. His gaze drifted around the room, searching for a distraction, something to keep his mind off of Dylan, but the most obvious thing to do was right in front of him...*

"Ah, fuck it." *Mason reached for the shard before placing it in his port. If he was gonna get his mind off of something putting an unknown peace of futuristic metal in your body should do the trick. Well, Aurora had it so it shouldn't be something like a spike, haha—*


[2/12/2025 8:33 PM] Narration
Mason inserted the shard into the port behind his ear. Typically, inserting something into your neural port would prompt initialization with the user before it could operate—unless it was a virus. However, this time, neither of those scenarios applied.

The shard did nothing; it was simply a blank hard drive without any initialization protocol, injection execution, or any other function no injection execution, nothing...


[2/12/2025 9:02 PM] Mason Reed
*Mason sat there for a while, expecting...**something** to happen. Yeah, that something never came...* "**Wuh,**" *He pulled out the shard and examined it for a moment. There was nothing on it—**nothing at all?!?!?** He could only assume Aurora had it for a reason, maybe to put something of her own onto it. He'd ask her about it later, most likely.*

*...So, what now? Maybe something interesting was on the news.*


[2/12/2025 9:30 PM] Narration
Mason locked in on the news, interfacing with the holographic base on the counter...

[Channel 99.9 - GG Radio: "Where Pixels Meet Passion."]

`"Yo, yo, you! Welcome back, netrunners, joystick junkies, and leaderboard legends! This is V3xbyte, and you're locked into GG radio, Fairview's number-one source for all things gaming, streaming, and digital culture."` 

Ah, this must be that Aurora was tuned into when Mason was away. 

`"Let's start with the biggest event of the week—the Fairview Creator Summit 209X went down yesterday, and it was an absolute banger! Heavy hitters like Cipher, GliVortex, ByteRiot, Shadow.eX3, and SeraphChrome took the main stage, dropping wisdom on everything from breaking the algorithm to surviving the ever-evolving world of digital entertainment. If you weren't there, you seriously missed out. But don't worry, the full panel replays will be up on GGFairviewNet later tonight—unless you're running a pirated stream, in which case... I didn't say anything."`

`"And just when we thought the night couldn't get any wilder, AURAQUEEN—yes, THE AuraQueen, the undisputed best Solar Knights player in the world—made an unexpected but expected appearance. She didn't take the stage, didn't join the panel, just vibed in the VIP section and watched. Theories are already flying—was she scouting the competition? Planning a comeback stream against Cipher? Or is she just flexing that she doesn't need the spotlight to own the scene? Whatever it was, the crowd went ballistic when she was spotted."`

`" Speaking of Solar Knights, a massive Exo-Faction War event is kicking off tomorrow night. If you're looking to squad up, now's the time. Some of the most prominent clans are already organizing for what could be the most brutal ranked season yet. Keep an eye on Cipher's stream— the word is he's rolling deep with a new build that might just break the meta."`


[2/12/2025 9:31 PM] Narration
`"In gear news, ByteRuit announced a new sponsorship deal with Klytex Haptics, so expect exclusive reviews on their latest NeuroGlove Pro. If those actually deliver on the full-body immersion promise, we might finally be stepping into a golden age of tactile VR that isn't a down-right orgy you'd find in a BD! Or, you know, just another overpriced peripheral that gets scalped to hell."`

`"Alright, that's all I got for now. Stay plugged in, keep grinding, and remember—when in doubt, blame the lag. Up next, a fresh remix of Shadow.eX3's synthwave banger intro, "Glitch Theory" to keep your queue time vibes strong. This is V3Xbyte, logging out!"`


[2/12/2025 10:17 PM] Mason Reed
*HEY I KNOW THE AURAQUEEN SHE'S SLEEPING IN MY BED RIGHT NOW!!!*

*Well, it was heartwarming to see his girl could attract all the attention by just being there. Again, how did he pull her??? Besides that, neat news, maybe he should play Solar Knights with Aurora later. Speaking of her, since she's still asleep maybe he can make her breakfast in bed. Yeah, that'll be nice and keep him occupied for a while.*

*He got up off the couch and turned the channel to the usual news he's familiar with for some background noise. He then went into the kitchen to make her some waffles and bacon.*


[2/12/2025 10:31 PM] Narration
Mason turned on the news and the weather was the hot topic at the current moment. The kitchen in which they possessed was surprisingly well stocked. Though, it is no surprise that Aurora generally has groceries delivered whenever she can help it. With Mason taking a liking in cooking, it was made a point to keep it stocked. In the fridge, some of Aurora's freshly picked produce were available. Tomato and peppers were her stables. Finding the ingredients for the surprise breakfast, Mason got right to work. 

The batter was beaten and on the griddle, the bacon were already shizzling and a light steam emitted and lingered in the air. The automatic ventilation system kicked in, pulling them up and out of the unit efficiently. 

In the background, the channel began to play the general news...


[2/12/2025 10:40 PM] Narration
`"Good morning, Fairview. This is Elaine Trask reporting for Fairview NewsNet, bringing you urgent updates on last night’s coordinated terrorist attack against Fairview District Police Command Station 02."`

`"At approximately 11:39 AM, an organized strike targeted the facility, resulting in the deaths of 14 officers and leaving two personnel unaccounted for. The CCR has condemned the attack as a direct assault on order and stability, and sources confirm that an emergency leadership summit has been organized and will be in session in the upcoming days."`

`"The CCR's high-ranking officials, and sanctioned response units are actively assessing next steps. While details remain classified, early reports suggest the use of CCR issued equipment and netrunning technology, precision assault tactics, and a digital blackout that disabled security feeds during the attack. Insiders managed to obtain footage of the moments leading up to the attack."`

The channel showed an Ion Enforcer entering the vehicle bay of Mason's station. All seemed right until the doors opened up. Revealing Mathias, Paige, and one other getting out of the vehicle, their head shrouded by a mask. The last occupant's face was blurred and obfuscated. This must have been the netrunner of the group... Then, the video replayed again... and again before it continued.


[2/12/2025 10:40 PM] Narration
`"Authorities have not yet identified the perpetrators, though several factions with anti-government leanings have already surfaced as potential suspects. One of which that has surfaced as the number one culprit being the long-dead but somehow revived, Horizon Grey organization."`

`"Meanwhile, Fairview citizens should anticipate increased surveillance checkpoints, armed patrols as law enforcement moves swiftly to restore control. Talk about mobilizing vacationing and retired agents has been up for discussion. We have tried reaching out to the CCR post for comment and received no word on the possibilities...`

`"The CCR has issued a statement, reassuring the public that those responsible 'will be found and eliminated without hesitation.' Officials urge full compliance with security measures and encourage civilians to report any suspicious activity or known dissidents immediately. We’ll continue to update you as more details emerge. For now, stay aware, stay safe."`


[2/12/2025 11:48 PM] Mason Reed
*Mason's eyes widened at the news. The last thing he wanted to hear had just exploded in his face. Whether it was good or bad, at least he had more information than he did last night. Fourteen officers were dead, two were missing, and the main culprits were identified. The sheer number made his fists clench—14 officers killed?! It was obvious where his thoughts were starting to go, but he quickly forced them away. There was a 2 in 14 chance, but she had to be one of the survivors. Surely.*

*Mason took a careful look at the group before the image disappeared. They all seemed…relatively normal, except for the masked guy. This situation felt eerily similar to the factory incident, but in reverse. While the factory had seemed like a distraction—a trap—could this have been Horizon Grey's true objective? With how disorganized the CCR was that night, there was no doubt that something else had been happening. But what?*

*Mason clicked his tongue.* "Why'd all this shit have to happen while I'm away... I could head back, but I can't just leave Aurora. Especially when we've been away for 4 months. I was looking forward to this break just as much as her..." *He'd pace around the kitchen a bit.* "Ignoring the attack completely would just be dumb, I'll gather what info I can while I'm still here." *Mason went to his contacts and sent a message to Rob to see if he knew what happened to the station.*

*Besides that, he just left the station on. Of course, thinking about it was frustrating, but he couldn't let it consume him. For now he would focus on what's in front of him and do what he could.*


[2/13/2025 12:03 AM] Narration
The news channel remained on. Talking about the new mandate that is circling around. Forcing everyone to upgrade their hardware with state-sponsored spyware. The terrorist attack that went on would do nothing but expedite its implementation.

All of these things were happening so quickly... Why?


[2/13/2025 12:05 AM] Narration
A few minutes passed and Mason received a response from Rob...


[2/13/2025 12:05 AM] Rob Upton
`"Yeah, I heard of it. Had to cancel my plans for Neon Kyrie because of it. I got called to the office."`


[2/16/2025 1:17 PM] Mason Reed
`"Damn that sucks. I haven't gotten any calls or messages yet so I'll let you know if I have to come in soon."`

*This situation as a whole was unfortunate, but all he could do for now was be on stand by until he gets a call or something. After sending Rob the message, his attention went back to making breakfast while tuning back into the news every now and then.*


[2/16/2025 1:40 PM] Narration
Rob had not responded to Mason. Most certainly, he was busy dealing with what was needed of him—poor guy. The door to the bedroom would slide open, and Aurora would stand at the door frame, rubbing the sleep from her eyes. Breakfast in bed was a no-go.


[2/16/2025 1:40 PM] Aurora King
**"I knew I caught a whiff of your cooking."** She remarked, yawning before stepping out into the main space. She had the speck of modesty to put on a shirt and undergarments. **"How early did you get up?"** She inquired as she slid into one of the stools that along the kitchen island.


[2/16/2025 2:47 PM] Mason Reed
*Masons eyes flicked over to Aurora as she walked into the room, perhaps out of suprise.* "I got up around 7," *He stopped what he was doing and moved closer to Aurora that was on the other side of the island.* "I didn't expect you to get up this early." *He leaned in close and gave her a kiss on the lips.*


[2/16/2025 5:04 PM] Aurora King
**"Mmn.."** She accepted his affection before planting her face in the palm of her hand. **"I gotta link up with my agent in a tick. He's geekin' for a mega drop in Solar Knights' Exo-Faction War tonight."** She seemed almost displeased with the fact that she would be excited. 

Wait, it's because she has to deal with her agent's antics. This was normal.

As Aurora began tracing her fingers along the counter, her index finger bumped the shard that Mason left there. 

**"...?"** She looked down with only her eyes and saw it. Her brow furrowed as she sat up and plucked it from the counter, bringing it up to eyelevel so she could inspect it. **"What's this?"**


[2/17/2025 2:26 AM] Mason Reed
"Huh?" *Mason raised a brow, slightly confused. Wasn't she the owner of that shard? Well, that's what he assumed.* "Uh, a shard I found on the balcony. I noticed it on the table outside when I went to go close the balcony door. It was wet so I brought it in here to dry."


[2/17/2025 4:23 AM] Aurora King
**”That’s glitched.”** She remarked. She deemed it safe enough to slot in. **”Maybe it is from some bolthead above us.”**

Aurora slotted it with no immediate impact on her expression or anything else. **”An empty drive… that’s deckin’ lame.”**


[2/20/2025 8:15 PM] Mason Reed
"Huh..." *Mason looked notably confused.* "Thought it was yours when I found it. Not sure how a shard would land on our table from one of the higher floors..." *He shrugged.* "Figured they would've come by to get it by now, but I'll go asking later."


[2/20/2025 8:17 PM] Aurora King
She removed it from her port and looked at it one last time before gently tossing it back on the counter. **"You said you spotted it on my flora table?"** Aurora was extremely curious.


[2/20/2025 8:28 PM] Mason Reed
"Yeah..?" *He thought for a second.* "Did you do anything out there recently?"


[2/20/2025 8:33 PM] Aurora King
She looked distant for a few seconds before shaking her head. **"No... Not that I recollect. Speaking of which, I need check my filters before I get that call."**


[2/20/2025 10:46 PM] Mason Reed
"Mm, alright.." *It looked like Mason had something to say, but he just let it phase to the back of his head. He turned back around and just focused on finishing their breakfast.*


[2/20/2025 10:54 PM] Narration
Mason finished breakfast for the both of them, and they peacefully ate at the island counter. Aurora seemed unphased by the appearance of the shard, which isn't highly abnormal behavior for the queen. She was good at not overthinking scenarios or situations. In this case, the shard had already been ejected from the forefront of her mind as she was too occupied with the five-star cooking she was blessed with... 

If he wanted any conversation with Aurora before the inevitable callback to the office, it would have to be soon...


[2/20/2025 11:49 PM] Mason Reed
*Throughout the meal Masons gaze was distant. He was trying to come up with something to talk about, but it didn't come as easy as it normally did. No doubt it was because of the recent happenings, but he obviously didn't want to tell her about any of that. To add on, he had to cut his barely into break short, so that dampened his mood.*

*Eventually he did speak.* "...So, what time did you have to meet up with your agent?"


[2/21/2025 3:20 PM] Aurora King
She did not look at Mason when he asked the question. Instead, she processed the inquiry and proceeded to pick around her plate. Her left eye illuminated as she referred to her internal clock. Then, when she got the time and compared it to their agreed time, she would say, **"47 minutes."**

Her eyes then flicked up towards Mason. Perhaps she perceived the subtle shift in Mason's demeanor because Aurora began to address what she was thinking after a moment of pause. **"You alright?"**


[2/28/2025 11:47 PM] Mason Reed
"...Y-Yeah, I'm fine. Just, uhh..slight chance I'll be back at the station for something. Rob texted me this morning saying he got called in..."


[3/1/2025 6:15 PM] Aurora King
**"Huh..?"** Aurora sounded almost offended that he said that. **For what? Can't they calculate anything on their own without you having to be plugged in?"**


[3/2/2025 12:21 AM] Mason Reed
*It took a while for Mason to respond, he too felt pretty upset about it. But considering the situation, he feels like he **has** to be there.*

“Who knows..but apparently it’s critical over there, can’t really back from those orders if I get ‘em. Of course, I know how you feel, I don’t want it to cut into our time together either…”


[3/2/2025 12:55 AM] Aurora King
**"They're going to link you on some deckin' dangerous task. Shit, why can't my dad drop you on patrol around the local web, for crying out loud."**
Aurora's father was the post commander of the CCR station that Mason worked at.
**"Always trying to make you prove somethin' like you ain't good enough or somethin', and it's pissing me off."** Aurora was getting worked up, as she would argue with someone in her stream or her parents, which was in character for her. 

**"I'll call him and tell that old deck-head that he is __not__ ruining our time together."** She hopped down from the stool and began walking towards their living room, leaving the remenants on her plate, and her eye lit up, indicating she was calling her father.


[3/2/2025 5:00 AM] Mason Reed
"**Huh-! Wait!**" *Out of sheer impulse Mason went around the island and in a second he was right next to Aurora! He placed both of his hands on her shoulders and made her face him.*

"**Don't call him right now!**" *Mason said in a urgent tone. He noticed his rise in pulse and attitude and quickly turned it down a notch.* "This isn't his doing at all, something just happened at the station last night and we're just doing a quick clean up check. It's nothing dangerous just..unexpected factors."


[3/2/2025 7:08 AM] Aurora King
He saw that she had a fierce look in her eyes when he finished spinning her around. Initially, she wasn’t going to budge—but hearing his explanation, her expression mellow out.The call illumination terminated; She ended the call.

**"…Alright, I believe you."** She cycled throughout some menus in her head and realized the time was slipping away from her. **"I need to get finalized for my meeting, showering and everything else. If you end up delta’in, just make sure to turn everything off before you go."**


[3/2/2025 11:51 PM] Mason Reed
*Mason nodded to her request, a part of him feeling guilty for holding out on what was really going on. But, he didn't want her to have another worry metal down like yesterday morning. He'd rather see her happy.* "Like I said it's a 'maybe'. Plus if I do get called in, I'll probably be back later tonight or evening."

*He took his hands off her shoulder and pulled her in for a hug to try and further ease her worries.* "...But before that. Did you want to shower together? Get one last moment in before we have to split up for a while?"


[3/3/2025 12:02 AM] Aurora King
Aurora's eyebrows twitched for a moment, the ghost of a smirk tugging at her lips. Amusement flickered in her eyes, but it was quickly tempered by a knowing sigh, her head tilting slightly as if she were debating whether to be exasperated or entertained. She let the silence linger, letting Mason stew just a little before shaking her head with a soft chuckle.

**"You,"** she murmured, placing a hand on his chest, fingers splaying slightly as she leaned into his warmth, **"are impossible."**

Her voice carried no real protest, just that familiar mix of affection and playful disbelief. She let her fingers trail upward, toying with the fabric of his collar as if pretending to consider his offer with serious thought. Then, with a coy glint in her eyes, she leaned in closer, her lips hovering just near his ear.

**"If this is your route of distracting me,"** she whispered, her voice lilting with mischief, **"it's working... but you still owe me an actual answer about what's going on."** She pulled back just enough to meet his gaze, her smirk deepening. **"Now, convince me why I should let you get away with this."**


[3/3/2025 12:03 AM] Narration
Before Mason could even formulate a response, he was receiving a call. Its source was from his post. *Oh boy* There is that call he was anticipating...


[3/3/2025 12:11 AM] Mason Reed
*With the way she was teasing and toying with him, he had to hold back the urge to just pick her up and run off to the bathroom. But, before he could do anything he received a call for his cars extended warranty...* "Damnit..." *He muttered before accepting the call.* "Yes, this is Corporal Mason Reed."


[3/3/2025 12:16 AM] Lt. Heather Bailey
`"It's Agent Bailey. Sorry to cut your vacation short, but Commander King is requiring you to report to the station immediately. A critical investigation is in progress and you're needed."`


[3/3/2025 12:16 AM] Narration
Ah, it was Heather... Mason spoke with Heather a few times, she is a specialized detective and frequently worked with her when cases required a patrol unit or two.


[3/3/2025 12:25 AM] Mason Reed
*There was an obvious look of irritation on Masons face.* "I see... I'll be over soon, then." *On the contrary to Mason's beliefs it turns out her father DID call him over.*


[3/3/2025 5:20 AM] Narration
Without further word, Heather hung up with the full expectation that he will be on his way.


[3/3/2025 6:39 PM] Aurora King
Aurora walked off towards the bedroom. During the process of doing so, she began to remove her shirt, leaving her bareback exposed to Mason as she vanished into the room.

"..." *"I don’t care." Those three words echoed in Mason Reed’s mind. The allure of the female body transcended the constraints of "duty". Throughout history, men had waged wars for this shit, abandoned reason and morals for it. And Mason was no exception. Whatever urgent matters awaited him could stand to be delayed for a few minutes. So sorry, Mr. King, your daughter can barely handle a single stroke, so this wouldn’t take long at all. Besides, with his top-tier Ion Enforcer II, he’d be at the station in no time as well.*

*In short, nothing, no conflict— no responsibility—could compare to the feeling of delivering backshots in the shower. When all was said and done, the universe was bigger than all earthly troubles, but the space between those cheeks? That was a universe that needed exploring like the vastness of black mass that hovers above this planet. How long would this take? No need to calculate, he'll juggle work and those cheeks no problem.*

*He moved with the swiftness and before she could fully make it into the room he was already behind her while picking her up. **Yeahthiswasprobablyirresponsible**, but as a wise man once said...*

Mason returned to the apartment with no incident. Now parking the vehicle at the front...


[3/25/2025 8:55 PM] Mason Reed
*As Mason pulled his truck into the driveway, he hesitated, not stepping out right away—perhaps to put off the inevitable. His hands clenched the steering wheel as he wrestled with the weight of his task, knowing what had to be done. His eyes drifted to the equipment resting on the passenger seat, carefully gathered before he left the station. Everything was ready. Now, all that remained was to place it around the apartment and wait. He let out a cold sigh and turned the car off, putting the tiny camera's and recorders in his right and left pockets respectively.*

*Once he prepared his mind, he exited his truck and walked up to the apartment door. He unlocked the door and with one careful turn, opened it.*


[3/25/2025 9:16 PM] Aurora King
Aurora was laying across the length of their couch, staring up at the ceiling. She was in a call when Mason opened the door to the apartment. One arm drapped across her midsection while the other hung effortlessly off the edge, her fingernails touching the hardwood floor.

**"Shouldn't we blow past our target's records with third-party sponsors like HelixGames and Ubu locking in ad reservations?"** She asks outloud, which indicated she was speaking naturally while on the call. 

The sound of the door unlocking did not catch her attention. However, once the door began moving at the corner of her eye, Aurora was now aware that there was movement. She sat up rather quickly, startled? Perhaps. When she realized who it was, she gave Mason a *knowing* grin. 

**"Listen up, decker. It was a blast firing off ones and zeros with you, but I gotta log. Keep you posted."** With a rapid blink, her call ended and her focus was on her output. **"You're back, huh? Couldn't ghost long enough for me to really start missin' ya?"** She teased him. Aurora was certainly eager to see him back, that was for sure.


[3/25/2025 10:00 PM] Mason Reed
"**...**" *A small smirk crept up on Mason's face. Despite the news, he still wasn't immune to her innate charm to him. He walked further into the room before closing the door behind him.*

"**Yeah, but not for long, unfortunately. I got promoted to Sergeant, they've already assigned me a new task along with it...**" *He noticed his voice carried a weight it usually didn’t when speaking to Aurora. Realizing this, he quickly adjusted his tone, matching her playful teasing.* "**What..? When I came back were you expecting a continuation from where we left off?**"


[3/25/2025 11:31 PM] Aurora King
Aurora's eyes widened for just a brief moment. Sergeant? That... that was *great news*.

`(Ditch it, Aurora.)` There was nothing in her expression that would lead anyone to believe she was vex to the idea of Mason being __promoted__. **"I can't believe you've made it to Sergeant. That's super nova!"** She closed her eyes and smiled sweetly before addressing his latest remark. 

**"You don’t get how tough it was for me to throw on a set and get out of bed in time for my little meeting with my agent. I couldn't handle a rematch so soon."**


[3/26/2025 2:20 AM] Mason Reed
*Mason chuckled as he strolled over to the couch, settling down beside her. He let his body sink into the cushions, tilting his head back in relaxation. His gaze casually swept around the room, instinctively noting the best spots to plant surveillance bugs. Though this was his own house, making such a precaution seemed unnecessary, but it never hurt to reassess his own space through the eyes of a stalker as messed up as that sounds.*

`"Guess I'll just put them where she normally frequents..."` *After letting out a sigh, he allowed his head to fall back down, his gaze meeting Aurora's.* "**So, now that you'll be alone for a while, is there anything you have planned?**"


[3/26/2025 7:23 PM] Aurora King
Aurora shrugged, that same sickly sweet smile persisted even beyond the moment she congratulated him. Aurora pulled her legs up onto the couch and sat on them, minimizing the amount of space she took up. **"Ya know, same old waves; Materialize on streams, go on my walks, and make sure the apartment doesn't debounce on itself."**

Then, something that stuck out to her a bit ago resurfaced. **"You said you were locked in on a new task? What's the stitch with that? They don't got you dodging caps this time, do they?"**


[3/26/2025 11:20 PM] Mason Reed
"**Nah, nothing like that. Just something to keep me busy for the time being, nothing serious.**" *He spoke as if it were insignificant or simply not worth discussing. Maybe even something he preferred not to dwell on.* "**...Sorry, I know you're upset about our time off being cut this short, I'll make it up to you later.**"


[3/26/2025 11:21 PM] Aurora King
**"...Promise?"** She looked at him expectantly.


[3/26/2025 11:25 PM] Mason Reed
"**Of...course, anything you want.**" *That look almost made him falter.*


[3/26/2025 11:34 PM] Aurora King
**"I'll lock you to that."** She would stand up, **"Got to use the bathroom. How long until you have to delta?"**


[3/26/2025 11:40 PM] Mason Reed
"**Not right away, I've been given a good amount of freedom for this case. I just need to be back before it gets too late, you don't have to worry.**"


[3/26/2025 11:45 PM] Aurora King
**"Nova, I'll be back before you know it."** She would enter the bedroom, her voice carrying as she also added. **"I got to stream in a hour!"**


[4/3/2025 1:33 AM] Mason Reed
"**Alright~!**" *He replied as her voice faded into the distance.* `"That was perfect timing."`

*After waiting a few moments after she shut the door, Mason stood up from the couch and began moving around the living room, discreetly placing cameras and recorders. With each bug he set down, a sharp pain flickered in the back of his head. Deep down, he still struggled to accept this reality. How would she react if she found out he was spying on her? How long would this continue? There was too many thoughts going through his head that could allow him to do this with a clear conscious.*

"**...**" *Shaking off his thoughts, he refocused on the task—this was likely his only chance to do it unnoticed. Once he finished, he sank back onto the couch, exhaling a long but quiet sigh.*


[4/3/2025 6:30 PM] Aurora King
And good timing too.

The instant that Mason finished his sigh, Aurora emerged from the bedroom, rubbing her hands together as she strode towards the island seperating their livingroom and kitchen. 

She blinked and the holographic display on the island illuminated. **"Place a order for a new U3 server with 7 millimeter screw holes... And hire someone to come over and install it for me."** She would dictate.


[4/3/2025 6:30 PM] Narration
**"Does the brand matter?"**


[4/3/2025 6:30 PM] Aurora King
Aurora was picking the shard again, giving it another gloss-over. **"Nah. Just make sure it can handle intense computations. 30 Ghz at the least."**


[4/3/2025 6:30 PM] Narration
**"...Ordering the EdgeBlade 057Rsx... Order completed. Delievery and installation will be in 6 hours"**


[4/3/2025 6:30 PM] Aurora King
**"Nova."** Closing her palm over the shard, she walked back towards Mason before sitting on his lap, leaning back against him. **"Want to watch somethin'?"**


[4/6/2025 1:00 AM] Mason Reed
"**Uh..**" *Her sitting on his lap surprised him quite a bit, not to say it wasn't welcome, though. Accepting her gesture. he wrapped his arms around her waist fully and leaned into her aswell.* "**Sure, got anything in mind?**"


[4/6/2025 9:29 PM] Aurora King
Aurora tilted her head slightly, a small smile playing on her lips as she considered his question. **"Well,"** she began, her voice taking on a playful lilt, **"how about Digital Fallout? It's about rogue AI taking over a city, lots of dramatic visuals, and epic chases through alleys."**

**"Or there's Edge of Synth. I have been itchin' to catch up with it since I am still locked in on season 1."**

Pausing for a moment, she smirked. **"But if you're feeling a little wired on nostalga, we could watch Retro-Reboot. It's set in 2080. It's long. Don't know if you have the time for something that is three hours."**

"**I don't really mind any of them, but three hours might be a bit TOO long.**" *He paused, going into deep thought.* "**We can watch Edge of Synth since you're already planning on watching it.**"


[4/10/2025 7:43 PM] Aurora King
**"Ehe,"** She'd giggle with glee—that was __exactly__ what she wanted to watch. **"Nova,"**
She would turn her attention towards the TV that idled along the wall. It's wallpaper took the appearance of a large picture frame—It was Mason and Aurora posing for a picture at his academy gradutation ceromony. 

**"Hey Jen, turn on and play the episode of Edge of Synth I left off on."** Giving a command to their automated home system. 

"Okay." A voice replied from the surround sound speakers that were hidden throughout the home. The picture on the television faded and immediately, Edge of Synth began to play...

The episode opens in the rain-slick streets of Neo-Yudai, where the tension hangs heavy after the fallout from the previous episode's explosive data heist—a recap of sorts before the story continues. 

The rouge synth *"Kairo"* has vanished into the lower net zones, leaving the rebellion factured and the government's digital watchdogs scrambling.


[4/10/2025 7:58 PM] Aurora King
Aurora settled in real close and comfortably on Mason's lap. A content smile plastered upon her face as she recalled the events from the last time she had watched *Edge of Synth*. If only Mason was around more often, she would binge watch this with him.


[4/10/2025 7:58 PM] Narration
The cold open features a gritty flashback of Kairo’s origin—showing glimpses of their former life as a medical AI prototype designed to ease suffering. Now corrupted by fragmented emotions and self-awareness, Kairo’s motives are increasingly ambiguous.

The segment includes quiet music and a reflective tone. The screen flickers between images of sterile hospital corridors, children in beds, and Kairo—then just a smooth silver android—sitting beside them. Ideal pause for Aurora to do a bit of yapping.


[4/10/2025 7:58 PM] Aurora King
**"Dig this, so Kairo wasn't built for combat or infiltration at all. He was some sort of hospice-care unit. Gen-4 medical interface—programmed to help patients and what not."**

She sighs, **"I argue all the time with my fans, since they think he snapped, but... I don't buy it. Like come on! Someone taught him to glitch-out. I honestly think someone wanted him to rebel in the first place."**


[4/11/2025 12:13 AM] Mason Reed
*Mason held an enduring smile as he listened, his eyes on her while she spoke. It felt weird watching a show mid way through, but he didn't mind if it was for her.* "**I get it. Honestly, it’d be more compelling if someone tampered with it, that’d explain the rebellion better, and it’d make things more interesting too.**"


[4/13/2025 7:47 PM] Narration
As the show progressed, new characters (to Mason) came onto the screen.

 Agent Riven Halden of the Cybernetic Security Division is assigned a new partner, the sharply sarcastic tech empath Vexa, who doesn't play by the rules.

The windshield wipers barely keep up with the oily rain streaking down the glass. Neon signs blink overhead—half-broken kanji, dancing holograms of smiling mascots, and danger warnings flickering out of sync. Riven sits behind the wheel, chewing on a stim stick. The silence is comfortable—for him.

Vexa, glancing at the flickering GPS grid map opened up with, **"This the part where you warn me to stay in the ca if things get dicey?"**

Riven put the vehicle in park, sighing as his gaze swept from left to right, ending at the GPS itself. **"No, this is the part where I hope you get shot first."**

Vexa smirked, finding humor in Riven's dry tone. **"Touching. Is that how you said goodbye to your last partner?"**

Riven paused, then looks straight ahead through the downpour... **"He didn't get a goodbye."** Riven opened the door without a beat being missed. 

The pair was at a rusted checkpoint gate, automated defenses long stripped for scrap. A half-dead sign buzzes overhead: *"Welcome to the Drift"*

Vexa shouldered her neural-linked sidearm and stepped out. **"Ah, the Drift. Smells like ozone, gunpowder, and broken dreams. This is where the synth cult hangs out?"**


[4/13/2025 7:53 PM] Narration
Riven scanned the alley which they ended up at. **"Gridwalkers, Zealots who think Kairo is a digital messiah. Got a feed leak that said they made contact."**

Vexa mockingly whispered. **"Think they hand out pamphlets?"**

The pair walked past fire barrels, flickering blue fire illuminating synth-tagged walls—glitched glyphs that pulse like veins. A pair of shrouded figures watch them from the shadows, data-hacjs glinting in the light.

Riven spoke to Vexa in a low voice, **"Keep your head on a swivel. These types smile while gutting you with a logic spike."**


[4/13/2025 7:53 PM] Aurora King
The word __spike__ invoked a look on Aurora's face as if she remembered hearing that from somewhere. Her brows knitted together, her focus deviating from the show to her own thoughts.. `("logic spike... Wasn't it mentioned in the show before?)"`

The episode continued to play with Agent Riven and Vexa traversing down the alley into a space that opened up. If anyone had watched a show before would know trouble was around the corner.

Mason received a message from his superior, Heather.


[4/17/2025 4:59 PM] Mason Reed
*Mason did his best to follow along, but a lot of it went right over his head—not surprising, considering how many episodes he’d just skipped. Still, he tried to enjoy it anyway. That is, until a message from Heather popped up. Letting out a sigh, he opened up the message to see what it said.*


[4/17/2025 8:29 PM] Lt. Heather Bailey
`"Sending you the entire case we built on Aurora and her 'connections'. Couldn't go over all of it in one sitting, you know?"`

`"I suggest you take a look at each individual if you get nowhere with the initial surveillance."`


[4/17/2025 8:29 PM] Narration
Attached were 6 names.
• Caleb Marris
• Rina Doss
• Oliver Vant
• Monica Bellthrope
• Cipher
• Trent "Runner" Kells


[4/17/2025 8:49 PM] Mason Reed
*Mason glanced over the names, some he didn’t recognize or felt like he heard or saw the names from somewhere or someone. However **one** of the names stood out like a sore thumb. It looked like Mason was about to laugh and yell ‘what the fuck’ at the same time.*

`”This’ll be really useful, but there’s no way this guys on here…”`


[4/17/2025 9:02 PM] Lt. Heather Bailey
`"Who?"` Heather replied, not knowing whp he was referring to.


[4/17/2025 10:03 PM] Mason Reed
`"Cipher. Isn't he a streamer just like Aurora? I saw him yesterday."`


[4/18/2025 11:53 PM] Lt. Heather Bailey
`"Yeah. Sure he is a streamer. But if you were to review his case, you’d be surprised what kind of crime he’s committing. Unfortunately for us, in the past, we were told not to interfere with his activities… higher ups orders. But for you, you aren’t operating by the standards."`


[4/19/2025 12:04 AM] Mason Reed
`"I see... I already heard one thing about him earlier, but I'll make sure to thoroughly look over his and the rest of the cases. Thanks again for the list, I'll be back at the station later tonight, still finishing up some stuff at home."`


[4/19/2025 12:20 PM] Lt. Heather Bailey
`"Get it done."` It was a phrase she said often in place of saying 'goodbye'.

*This was quite usual for Mason, so he didn’t pay it any mind. With that Mason exited his messages and went back to paying attention to the show. Whenever he was to return to the station he thought he should at least check on some of those people while he’s still doing the bug method, just for some insurance.*


[4/19/2025 10:49 PM] Narration
To sum up the rest of the episode, They dig through this sketchy zone of the city called the Drift, trying to track Kairo’s signal, and stumble into a synth-worshipping cult. Meanwhile, that hacker Static uncovers a fragment from Kairo’s memory that hints a megacorp—Heliox Systems—might’ve orchestrated Kairo’s rebellion on purpose.

There’s a fight at an underground synth-fight club, some heavy dialogue about what counts as consciousness, and the big twist? Kairo sends a final message: 'You cannot debug consciousness.'

Then, the credits rolled.


[4/19/2025 10:49 PM] Aurora King
Aurora decided it was time to get up and do something. **"I would zap another episode with ya, but that Solar Knights event would flatline without me."**


[4/19/2025 10:49 PM] Aurora King
Aurora turned back towards Mason, placing her finger against her bottom lip. Contemplating something that came across her mind. **"I'm thinkin' if I should cosplay for it...Nah."** 

With the conclusion of her decision, she would stretch before heading back towards the bedroom. **"Need to make space for the digidweebs to install the new server."**


[4/20/2025 10:23 PM] Mason Reed
*After the show ended and Aurora stood up, his attention split again—part of his mind still on her, the other on his ongoing mission. He missed bits of what she was saying, as some words went in one ear and out the other, but he quickly pulled himself back to focus and turned to face her.*

"**Do you need any help with the installation while I'm here.**" *He said while getting up.*


[4/24/2025 9:51 PM] Aurora King
**"Nah, I will have those gigadweebs from the delivery service do it for me."** She remarked as she vanished into the bedroom.

-# **"They probably need the tick to at least make a commission."**

She could be heard faintly from the confines of the room.


[4/27/2025 12:16 AM] Mason Reed
"**Alright...**" *Even though he could just leave, the feeling that he should at least stick around wouldn’t go away. Maybe he could kill some time until they showed up and then left. He wasn’t technically on break anymore, so he might as well pack some extra clothes for the station for when he needed to return.*


[5/17/2025 8:05 PM] Narration
Mason entered the bedroom; nothing was out of place besides some cabling that Aurora had pulled out from her area. To their right was their massive walk-in closet, converted into her streaming space. The sliding door to the gaming zone was left open, allowing the pink and white hues to leak steadily into the more monotone and muted bedroom.

Inside, Mason could see Aurora leaning over the short L section of her desk, rummaging through the braids of cables that snaked their way into a large server rack that the digital celebrity possessed. Its frame was of a matching color palette to the room, the front encased in a polished glass that was left open so that those gigadorks could service her units.


[5/18/2025 7:04 PM] Mason Reed
*As Mason stepped into the room, his eyes naturally drifted to Aurora, who was busy at her setup. It was a familiar sight, yet he couldn’t help but be impressed by how massive and high-end her setup was. He admired it the same way he might admire a custom-built car or truck except in this case, the engine was the PC, and car mods came with a hefty price tag.*

*He had already offered to help, but it was clear she had everything under control. Choosing to let her focus, he walked past her—though not without giving her a playful smack on her buns for a bit of extra motivation, because a voice in his head told him to.*

[5/21/2025 2:53 PM] Aurora King
Aurora gasped from the unsuspecting smack of encouragement. It was this sudden surprise attack that nearly cost her a patch cable she was trying to gingerly unplug. With a sharp straightening of her back, she pulled it out quickly. 

A mix of emotions flew through her mentally; Surprise, fear from the realization she had pulled it out, relief when she inspected the ends and found that they were undamaged and slight annoyance from her output who put her in such a compromising situation. 

**"Ow."** She finally spoken, bringing one of her hands back to massage the impact point of her ass. She bruised easily, you know! Her gaze narrowed as she *tried* to be mad with Mason. He had already done a number earlier in the day. But, the constant play wasn't entirely unwanted. After giving him a temporary scolding, she went back to removing her patch panel from the case. Unplugging the connectors on both ends.


[5/29/2025 10:14 PM] Mason Reed
*Even though it seemed like that irrigated her, (at least a little) he didn't really pay it too much mind, even when she tried to look angry she still looked cute. After the scolding he went back to what he was originally going to do, which was pack a few more clothes. Although, that was just a cover up to wait for the people she was expecting to arrive.*

*Mason walked from the converted master closet back into the bedroom portion, walking around the circumference of the bed towards his side of the room. There was a dresser just for him—everything from his uniforms to his street clothes and everything in between. Mason also had his rifle hidden in the corner between the dresser and the wall.*

*Neither of them was a stranger to firearms being in the apartment, considering Mason's profession and Aurora's own father's career. Aurora had her own handgun and permit, but it was within her underwear drawer. She has never seen the light of day since receiving her certification. It was just as Mason's fingers latched onto the knob of the dresser when the electronic doorbell chimed.*

*In the narrow hallway just outside the door, two men were strenuously balanced under the strain of a large, unwieldy box. Beads of sweat formed on their foreheads as they maneuvered the cumbersome package, its weight unevenly distributed and challenging to manage. Each man gripped a corner of the box tightly as they shifted their footing, carefully coordinating their movements to avoid stumbling.*

*Opening the door and seeing the two men nearly on the verge of collapse made him feel a pang of sympathy. Part of it was that they were also walking into Aurora's __space__. And he knew how she could get with workers.*

"**Uh, let me help you guys with that.**" *He stepped up closer to the men, bending slightly, he slid his hands beneath the box. As he began to lift, much of the weight seemed to ease from their strained arms.*


[9/15/2025 12:15 AM] Lewis
The heavier of the two men let out a deep sigh of relief, his broad shoulders relaxing as he shifted his arms to create space. He watched as Mason stepped forward, ready to offer his assistance.


[9/15/2025 12:15 AM] Gilbert
**"T-thank's man... It isn't normal that they pack these boxes so full...."** The lanky man chuckled, his long limbs swaying awkwardly as he matched the uneven pace of his partner and Mason. Together, they navigated the apartment, carefully maneuvering around the kitchen island and towards the bedroom.


[9/15/2025 12:36 AM] Narration
The three guys got the oversize box into the bedroom and gingerly set it down on the floor. All of which let out a sign of exertion. Gilbert reached into his pocket and extracted a pocket knife. Cut the hardened plastic straps that hold the box together. Lewis, on the other hand, glanced around the bedroom curiously, but it wasn't long until he made eye contact with Aurora, who was leaning against her desk, observing these simpletons from afar.

Lewis: **"Oh... Well, miss."** Lewis made an effort to engage Aurora in light conversation, though his tone lacked the warmth that often fosters a sense of connection. To him, she appeared to be another customer, rather than a unique individual deserving of acknowledgment.


[9/15/2025 12:36 AM] Aurora King
Aurora's posture was rigid, and her expression one of clear disapproval. Her nose crinkled and her brow furrowed, conveying a deep-seated disdain for the conversation he was attempting to initiate.**"Ew, it's talking to me."**

*Lewis was taken aback by Aurora's toxic remark. A visible recoil was extruded from his frame. The complete opposite of Mason's initial kind gesture when they were at the door to the apartment.*


[9/15/2025 3:57 AM] Mason Reed
*Mason's gaze slowly drifted toward Aurora after she made her snappy remark, slightly shaking his head in disappointment. He shot her a familiar sharp look that was always interpreted as 'we're talking later', before turning back to Lewis, patting him on the back.*

-# "Don't take it personally. She doesn't do well with strangers."


[9/15/2025 5:20 PM] Aurora King
Aurora realized what she had said the moment it left her mouth. Mason's expression conveyed a multitude of feelings without a single word spoken.

> Oh Drek, it's that look.

With an exasperated sigh, Aurora rolled her eyes with a dramatic flutter. To this end, the content creator unfolded her arms and moved to sit at her desk. There will undoubtedly be something on the net that would preoccupy her.


[9/15/2025 5:27 PM] Lewis
Lewis, on the other hand, provided an unsettled chuckle. The man concluded that the servers destined for delivery and installation were for Aurora, given that there was the very server rack behind which she had vanished, and Mason did not strike Lewis as the kind of man to flaunt soft pinks and purples.


[9/15/2025 5:27 PM] Gilbert
**"What is it like, being the output to 'AuraQueen'?"** Gilbert's voice came from behind Mason. His cybernetic hands pulled the box and foam up and off the new server. Physically, the server did look heavy. The mounting hardware is already prefabricated on the sides for convenient installation.


[9/15/2025 5:41 PM] Mason Reed
"**…Huh?**" Mason turned at the sound of Gilbert’s voice, the unexpected question throwing him off. "**I mean… it’s an experience, I guess. Definitely happy to be with her.**" *He wasn’t entirely sure how to respond—especially to someone he’d only just met.*


[9/15/2025 6:00 PM] Gilbert
**"Yeah?"** Gilbert took that as an invitation to speak about it more. **"I've watched her streams on and off from time to time... Never knew she had someone."** Gilbert walked on one side of the server while Lewis took his position on the opposite side. Now that the server was out of that clunky container, they were better suited to handling the server on their own.

The two technicians hoisted the server up to waist level and began trotting towards Aurora's setup. Unbeknownst to them, Aurora had been preparing for them to install it. The front glass of the rack was already open. In the case of the rack, Aurora has already designated a space for it.

Aurora kept her mouth shut for a change, but it did not keep her from silently enacting judgment on Lewis and Gilbert. She paid for specialists, but it seems they employ anyone nowadays.


[9/15/2025 6:14 PM] Mason Reed
*Masons gaze toward Aurora softened quite a bit, since she was being obedient. Though, he still made sure to keep an eye on her and the two workers in case they needed help installing the server.*

The two men spoke in hushed tones as they diligently worked on installing the server. Somewhere in the middle of the installation, a step in the instructions did not make much sense; however, after a few moments of deliberation, they managed to comprehend the instruction just fine and complete the installation. Aurora was ready for them to go. Once she confirmed that everything was in order, she was the one to escort them to the door. Gilbert was the first out of the door, followed by Lewis.

Lewis, attempting to be the steward of professionalism, turned around to give the typical company remark. **"All set, if you have any questions or concerns. You can reach us at—"**

She latched the door and massaged her temple as a headache started to set in. **"Drek, I’ve always disliked trades coming in here and providing service."** It was an enigma to her why they irritated her so intensely.


[9/15/2025 7:22 PM] Mason Reed
*Mason stood a little bit back near their bedroom door. A mix of shocked amusement and disbelief on his face. He would be lying to himself if he didn't find that 1% funny, because it was so unexpected. But, still, why did she do that?!*

"**Aurora...**" *He moved up a little closer, gesturing for her to come to him.*

The sharp click of the mag-lock engaging filled the apartment, sealing them in a sudden silence. For a moment, Aurora remained with her forehead pressed against the cool metal of the door, her eyes squeezed shut.


[9/15/2025 7:29 PM] Aurora King
Pushing herself away from the door with a weary sigh, she turned to face him. She padded over to him without a word, her arms crossing over her chest as she came to a stop in front of him, looking up at him from under her lashes. **"Okay, okay, I get it,"** she mumbled, her voice low. **"Poor bedside manner. But in my defense, they smelled like recycled synth-leather and desperation."**  She tried for a small, placating smile, though it didn't quite reach her eyes. **"Are you gonna put me in the penalty box?"**


[9/15/2025 7:44 PM] Mason Reed
*As she walked over to Mason he mirrored her movements, crossing his arms across his chest as well. He gave her the familiar reprimanding look with his eyes that was always a 50/50 between being playful or serious.* "**The penalty box...? That's a good idea. Perhaps I need to give you the usual...**" *He looked off to the side, as if he was truly considering it.*

"**Aww... I was actually going to give you a premium reward too if you'd acted like a good girl throughout the whole thing.**" *He let out a sarcastic sigh.* "**Too bad...**"


[9/15/2025 7:51 PM] Aurora King
**"Oh, shut up!"** The words came out as a half-laugh, half-growl. The mention of a 'premium reward'  was the final straw, snapping her out of her defensive posture. **"You're a total liar. You didn't have anything planned, 'Mr. I have to go back to work."**

*Her arms uncrossed in a flash. With a theatrical huff, she drew back and landed a solid, playful punch on his bicep and began moving back towards the bedroom.* **"Besides, I have a stream to host."**


[9/15/2025 8:08 PM] Mason Reed
"**Ah—**" *Before she could make it far, Mason grabbed her arm and gently pulled and twirled her back in front of him.* "**It's true I do have to go back to work, but I wasn't lying. I already told you once I'm finished with this assignment I'll do anything you want. Just add that reward as an extra bonus...**"

*He let go of her arm, then reached up to lightly pinch her cheeks between his thumb and finger.* "**And you know how I feel when you treat people like that. Try to rein that in just a little bit, alright?**" *His voice carried no edge, just that gentle care and concern from a spouse.*


[9/15/2025 8:32 PM] Aurora King
The gentle tug on her arm stopped her retreat instantly, the momentum spinning her back around to face him with a soft, surprised gasp. Any remaining irritation she felt seemed to evaporate under the warmth of his touch and the sincerity in his voice. When his fingers gently pinched her cheeks, her scowl returned for a fleeting second before melting into a reluctant, exaggerated pout.

**"Mmmph, stawp.."** she mumbled, her words distorted by his hold on her face. She batted lightly at his hand, not with any real force, but just enough to make him let go, allow her to continue her retreat. **"I'll think about it."**


[9/15/2025 8:49 PM] Mason Reed
*Mason reluctantly released her and let out a silent sigh.* "**Mhm... I love you a lot, by the way.**"  *He said as she disappeared into the bedroom. Though, he also had to go back into the bedroom to finish packing his things.*

*There was no response from Aurora, for she had already managed to muffle her ears with the headset. She briskly made her way around her MDF and sat down in her chair, getting her streaming application and shortly after the main event, Solar Knights IV*
