[6/5/2023 1:49 AM] Narration
By the time Kaedues and Danny arrived to the Condo it was already midnight. The nightlife in Fairview and Neon Kyrie never seem to cease as AV's and the sound of distant traffic filled the atmosphere.

Danny's Condo was spacious and clean. The floors polished and furniture complimented the warm lighting well.


[6/5/2023 1:51 AM] Danny Donovan
**"All I ask if that you keep it down. The little ones are asleep."** So Danny does have children. Then again, how much has Kaedues hung out with Danny __after__ hours.


[6/5/2023 1:56 AM] Kaedues Staub
*Kaedues chuckles a little.* **"You don't have to worry about that. I'm here to sleep, thanks to your kindness."**

*Kaedues barely registers the furniture. What he does notice is the polish, and to it he smiles.* **"But if you want to give me a tour, I'll come along."**


[6/6/2023 9:15 PM] Danny Donovan
**"Another time."** Danny said weakly, he was already at his limits for the day. So much has happened in one day. He would point towards the couch as he began making his way towards the hallway in the condo. **"Don't got no extra rooms, going to have to settle for the couch. I'll bring out some spare blankets."**


[6/7/2023 12:02 PM] Kaedues Staub
*Shop 1113's work mule was just as exhausted. He makes his way towards the couch Danny mentioned and sits down.*

*As he sits, the feeling of exhaustion strikes his whole body like a wrecking ball. Starting at his legs, then his torso, then his arms. He waits for Danny to bring the blankets.*


[6/8/2023 12:12 AM] Danny Donovan
He would return within the minute with a comforter and a spare pillow. **"Rest up, we got a lot of ground to cover tomorrow."** That said, Danny would hand over the items to Kaedues.


[6/8/2023 1:07 AM] Kaedues Staub
*Kaedues goes to reach out with both arms but retracts his right arm halfway to. He gently takes the pillow and places it down. Then he takes the comforter, having a little trouble but getting himself comfortable.*

**"Thanks, Danny. You're a real nice guy."** *Kaedues looks up at Danny. He looks just a little paler than normal, and his eyelids look heavy with exhaustion.* **"I'll pay you back somehow."**

*With that, Kaedues lays down. He's asleep within moments. While normally Kaedues regulates his sleep, today has been unpredictable. Tonight, Kaedues would sleep harder. He would sleep longer. As the sound around him tones out Kaedues opens his eyes again.*

` `


[6/8/2023 1:25 AM] Kaedues Staub
*When Kaedues opens his eyes, he sees the familiar windshield and steering wheel he remembers s̷̫̅o̴̪̔ well. Suddenly, his blurred perception of reality phases out entirely. With his right hand back, Kaedues feels comfortable dismissing today as nothing but a horrible thought. Be ca̵̿̀reful, Kaedues.*

*He adjusts his rearview mirror and takes another look at the set of d̴̕ͅic̷̲̚e that have always been hanging there. Their blu̸͎̾ė̷ͅ ̸̤͂ color really stands out to Kaedues. Now he checks his blind spots, side view mirrors, and of course, Gr̸̞̕ace. There she is, and she's buckled up. He wouldn't have told her to, but it's nice to see.*

*He accelerates now and reaches into his armrest compartment to fetch his favorite kind of gum. He gently unwraps it and places it onto his tongue like usual. Its st̶̪̅r̵̦̿awb̷͓̿ë̷̹rry flavor stands out to him as he drives.*

*Kaedues drives very well! It's one of the things he is proud of as the roads in Vespera can at times be very daunting. Kaedues reminds himself he's taking Grace to freerun along with him. Hopefully the abandoned building idea didn't scare her too much.*

*Kaedues feels optimistic and energized during the ride.*

[6/8/2023 1:45 AM] Kaedues Staub
*The drive forward is filled with small talk about work, since Kaedues isn't much good at bringing anything else up. Hey, a least he's trying. He thinks her responses are interesting and inticing. Despite the sad undertone of her response he feels that there is much more to her than her exterior.*

*Kaedues steers the car into a tunnel. The bright lights filling the underpass are moment̸̥̃ä̴͔rily inț̷̾e̸͎̋r̶͔͒rupted by short blankets of darkness. Then, Grace begins asking a question. Now that he has the time to listen to her, everything sounds just a little fuzzy. That's okay, he understands the gist of it.*
*Something he said made Grace ask him why he does it all. He went well out of his way to help her with the MK-25. He didn't have to do that. So why? And why did he treat his job like his lifeblood? Kaedues knows he is capable.*

*His train of thought derails when he hears the sound from his speaker getting louder(See above link). The drums stand out to Kaedues. They stand out a lot. In fact, the drums are unlike anything he's heard before. Unlike anything he listens to.*
*As the drums begin to stand out, Kaedues feels his right foot slowly push forward. The weight of the car shifts more than he's comfortable with. He tries to correct his steering, his footing, but can't. He continues to chew his strawberry gum to soothe himself.*

*. . .*


[6/8/2023 2:00 AM] Kaedues Staub
*His foot won't respond to him, like a defiant child. He finds himself checking his rearview mirror and sideview mirrors. Grace looks a little unnerved. At this point, Kaedues has made it out of the tunnel. He watches as his car moves forward down a stretch of road. A bend comes into view on the horizon.*
*The drums continue to grow louder.. louder.. louder. Grace is saying something to him. He wants to move his head but it stays stuck. His fingers wrap around the steering wheel, hanging on for dear life. The drums get louder. Kaedues flips the gum with his tongue and is suddenly revolted by its sickly sweet flavor and sticky texture. The more he chews, the looser and thicker the gum becomes until it eventually has the consistency of peanut butter.*

*The drums get louder.*
*He can't hear anything else, but he can feel. Kaedues feels his foot continue to press on the accelerator. He feels bound. Bound so tightly, he can't even struggle. It is as if Kaedues really is only his eyes, watching himself work. He looks at his speedometer...*
*70 MPH.*
*The bend is coming into view. Grace is scared. She's horrified and she's screaming and she's looking around and touching me. The drums are getting louder. The van is going too fast and I can't take my foot off the pedal. The drums are getting louder.*
*I'm crossing the midsection. There's oncoming traffic. I can't stop chewing. That set of dice isn't mine. The drums are getting louder. I can't blink. I can't breathe. I can't move. The drums are getting louder.*

*The car is swerving.*
` `


[6/8/2023 2:04 AM] Kaedues Staub
*Kaedues sits up before he even knows he's awake. He takes a deep breath in, and then another. He lets the air fill his lungs. He flexes the fingers on his left hand.*

[6/9/2023 9:47 AM] Narration
The bright and true sunlight filtered through the windows of the condo. It's influence within the living room provided sufficient ambient light. The faucet could be heard running off to Kaedues' right. Someone was in the kitchen.


[6/10/2023 4:00 PM] Kaedues Staub
*Kaedues takes a moment to really compose himself. It was just a dream. Dreams are nothing but collections of memories from your past... Nothing important. It's nothing important. His breathing feels natural now.*

*He rises to his feet and then looks around. He really gets a chance to look at Danny's condo now. His initial impression is only amplified.*
*Kaedues investigates the noise. He moves toward the origin of the running water sound and keeps his head on a swivel.*


[6/10/2023 4:27 PM] Narration
The condo was silent, saved from the kitchen faucet, soothing humming of appliances, and digital interface chirps that resonated throughout the home. Kaedues would come across some toys meant for children, more or less scarcely dotting the floors—evidence of kids' activity within the house. As Kaedues walked further into the condo, a drone swooped beside Kaedues. The bulb-like lens would flicker briefly, illuminating a holographic display showing the forecast for the day.

It followed Kaedues as he moved forward and spoke to him with a feminine voice, **"Greetings! I hope this message finds you well. I wanted to bring your attention to the current weather conditions, which display partly cloudy skies with a temperature of 25 degrees Celsius. It appears there is a slight possibility of light rain, approximately 10%. If it pleases you, may I offer to provide you with the latest news?"**


[6/10/2023 4:32 PM] Kaedues Staub
*Kaedues' quiet investigation is stopped when a drone enters his vision. His eyes snap to the small drone and what information is displayed in front of him.*

**"... Yes. I want to see the news."** *Kaedues speaks loud and clear and in simple terms to electronic devices. To Kaedues they are all tools.*


[6/10/2023 4:50 PM] Narration
**"I would be delighted to provide you with the latest updates."** As it went through the news, it would flash images, videos and audio as it cycled through its program...


[6/10/2023 4:50 PM] Narration
**"During a virtual concert by idol Aria-X at the HyperDome last night, a riot broke out due to fans and security clashing over the discovery that Aria-X's latest songs were encrypted and only accessible through the purchase of an expensive neural decryption key."**


[6/10/2023 4:50 PM] Narration
**"The Metasphere is currently seeing a surge in demand for virtual real estate, with major corporations vying for ownership. A digital island was recently sold for a staggering 2 billion credits to an undisclosed buyer, leading to rumors of potential virtual nation-states backed by corporations."**


[6/10/2023 4:50 PM] Narration
**"An ongoing conflict between data carriers has escalated, with virtual skirmishes reported in cyberspace. Known as the Bandwidth Wars, this conflict centers around controlling data flow and bandwidth in increasingly crowded cyber domains. Users are warned to update their ICE protections as stray data bullets are causing collateral damage."**


[6/10/2023 4:51 PM] Narration
**"There has been a delay in the CyberBall Championship due to allegations of top players using illegal neural enhancers. This scandal has caused a stir in the world of professional cyber-athletics."**


[6/10/2023 4:51 PM] Narration
Droning on and on until the ambient blue light coming from within the drone turned red!

# BREAKING NEWS


[6/10/2023 4:52 PM] Narration
**"In breaking news, Littleton was rocked last night by a high-octane showdown between security forces and a figure believed to be the long-thought-dead member of Horizon Grey, Paige Underwood. Horizon Grey, labeled as a terrorist organization by authorities, has been in hiding since the infamous Kilo killings in District One several years ago."**


[6/10/2023 4:52 PM] Narration
**"It began when the CCR identified and pursued Underwood through the streets of Littleton. As the conflict peaked, an unknown accomplice emerged from the shadows to aid Underwood in her daring escape. Despite CCR deploying additional forces, the duo managed to disappear into the underground tunnels of Littleton."**


[6/10/2023 4:53 PM] Narration
**"In the aftermath of the skirmish, the CCR has imposed a stringent lockdown on Littleton, restricting all movement in and out of the area while investigations are conducted. Residents have been urged to remain indoors and report any suspicious activity."**


[6/10/2023 4:53 PM] Narration
**"The lockdown has caused anxiety among the residents of Littleton, who are now living under constant watch. There are reports of civilians organizing themselves into neighborhood watches and digital defense groups to protect against further escalation."**


[6/10/2023 4:53 PM] Narration
**"This incident marks a resurgence of the elusive Horizon Grey and the formidable Paige Underwood, setting the stage for a tense stand-off between the terrorist group and the security forces."**


[6/10/2023 4:54 PM] Narration
The drone would then turn off its display, zipping up into the ceiling.


[6/10/2023 5:42 PM] Kaedues Staub
*Concerts? Real estate and cyber conflict? Boring.. Kaedues tunes it out. What does catch his attention though is an apparent lockdown on Littleton. Kaedues raises an eyebrow as he hears about Horizon Grey and Paige Underwood. He keeps the names in mind.*

**"That's gonna make things suck."**


[6/10/2023 6:09 PM] Narration
Kaedues finally made it to the kitchen. To the left of the sink was the dishwasher. Unlike other dishwashers, it was more of an open rack than a cube. A cage-like arm sweeps over the dishes and neutralizes the debris and potential germs with lasers dancing across the surfaces. The kitchen was spacious, with a small cylinder robot cleaning the floors.


[6/10/2023 6:09 PM] Stephanie Donovan
At the sink itself, the faucet was running. However, between Kaedues's line of sight to the tap was a woman who had her back to Kaedues, seemingly unaware of his presence at the given time. She had long dark brown hair, only noticable due to the light within the kitchen shining through her strains. A tall and slender body. 

Suddenly, her head cocked to the side as if she sensed something. With a graceful movement, she glanced over her shoulder, her eyes widening when they fell upon Kaedues. For a moment, a look of utter surprise etched across her features, causing her to pivot halfway toward him.

**"Oh, heavens!"** she gasped, her slender hand flying to her chest, where she clutched the fabric of her shirt just above her heart. She then gifted him with a soft, though somewhat flustered smile. **"Sorry, it is not often we have guests this early, yet alone spend the night."** Her eyes, still wide with the remnants of her initial shock, now appeared to sparkle with a newfound curiosity regarding the stranger in her kitchen.


[6/10/2023 7:05 PM] Kaedues Staub
*Kaedues looks battered and bruised. His cuts and bumps are still swollen from the night before, causing much of his complexion to shift red.*

*He looks at Stephanie curiously for a moment. Does Danny have a sister? Is this his wife? Could be an older child or even a friend. Hearing her apologize causes Kaedues to straighten out his posture and hold a hand up.* **"You shouldn't apologize for that. I could have made myself known."** *Kaedues scans the kitchen for a moment before returning to Stephanie. She mentioned that Kaedues is a guest, so Danny must have let this person know he would be sleeping. That kind of decision shows commitment.*

**"...Are you dating Danny?"** *He guesses.*

[6/10/2023 9:33 PM] Stephanie Donovan
She looked towards Kaedues, taken aback by the question. Her first reaction to the question was to laugh. It was a small chuckle, a chuckle of endearment in fact. She squinted her eyes and grinned. The innonence of this one she thought. Reaching behind herself, she would grab a hand towel to dry off her hands. **"No, we aren't dating. Danny and I are married; I'm Stephanie."** Once dried, she would fold it once and draped it over a cupboard handle.


[6/10/2023 9:48 PM] Kaedues Staub
*Kaedues' curious expressionfalters when Stephanie laughs, which causes him to loosen up. When she mentions that they are married, a smile forms across his face.* **"Good. That's great."** *He exhales and shifts his weight slightly.*

**"Danny brought me here after I tried to sleep in my own sink."** *He explains. Just gonna let that one sit there on the air.*


[6/10/2023 9:55 PM] Stephanie Donovan
It's hard to make what he said sound normal, but she tries. Her face smiled powerfully as she nodded vigorously clearly. He is a very interesting person in many ways.  **"Oh wow, Um, well. I am glad my husband done that. He is quite the... er— charitable man."**


[6/10/2023 10:01 PM] Kaedues Staub
*Kaedues looks around and then back at Stephanie.* **"Sorry, probably not the best thing to start with."** *Kaedues runs his right hand through his hair-- or he thinks he does. Actually it just looks like he's doing a backstroke.*

**"My name is Kaedues Staub. I make a living by lending my hands anywhere people want them."** *He makes a grand gesture with both (one) of his hands.* **"Danny and I work together."**


[6/10/2023 10:10 PM] Stephanie Donovan
**"Ah."**


[6/10/2023 10:10 PM] Danny Donovan
He would walk in, curious on what was going on. He looked like he just climbed out of bed himself. Not wearing his headphon- wait, he was not wearing his headphones confirming the myth that he did not have ears, huh. Anyways, he walked in, hair a mess and but at least he was wearing clothes. **"Morning dear."** Then, he would turn his gaze towards Kaedues, **"You're up, expected you to be out for at least a few more hours."**


[6/10/2023 10:13 PM] Stephanie Donovan
She was not going to wait for the casual conversation to continue, she had more on her agenda than just the kitchen. **"Danny, honey, I have to go to work. Can you clean and put away the kids' toys? I told them to do it but they don't listen and I don't got time. Just finished the dishes."** Without a confirmation from Danny, she would walk up to him and peck him on his cheek before grabbing her keys and heading out the door. **"Love you, bye."**


[6/10/2023 10:14 PM] Danny Donovan
**"Oh- yeah, of course. See you when you get back."**


[6/10/2023 10:14 PM] Narration
The door opened and clicked closed.


[6/10/2023 10:15 PM] Kaedues Staub
*Kaedues turns to Danny.* **"I woke up early. I didn't sleep very well, that's all it is."** *Kaedues nods.* **"Thank you for letting me stay for the night."**


[6/10/2023 10:22 PM] Danny Donovan
**"Yeah, don't mention it."** He would rub his face, sighing as there were more things than just Kaedues' sanctuary on his mind. **"Ugh listen, so Littleton is locked down, Kaedues. That means we have no way of getting to the shop."** He would explain, finally done rubbing his face and crossing his arms. **"I already spoke with James so we are good until the lockdown lifts."**

[6/10/2023 10:24 PM] Kaedues Staub
**"...."** *Kaedues looks __mortified__. His jaw drops and his pupils shrink as though he was just told he was adopted or something.*

**"Are you telling me I am trapped in __fairview__?"**


[6/10/2023 10:28 PM] Danny Donovan
**"Well,"** He took the question literally so he put some thought into it. **"Fairview is smaller than Haven Height, sure but there are higher quality places. A direct bridge to Neon Kyrie if that interests you."**


[6/10/2023 10:28 PM] Danny Donovan
**"So not really trapped here. Just can't enter Littleton, which mean you cannot go to Haven Heights."**


[6/10/2023 10:31 PM] Danny Donovan
**"If you're worried about where to stay, I already spoke with my wife. You're more than welcome to stay here until the lockdown is lifted. It also lets us see if we cannot check in on Grace. Speaking of which, I need to talk to her father again. See if he changed his tune."**


[6/10/2023 10:32 PM] Danny Donovan
**"There are...pressing matters that I need to run through him as well so I guess this is a win."**


[6/10/2023 10:35 PM] Kaedues Staub
**"Thanks as well, Danny. I'll see if there's anything I can do here in fairview or otherwise."** *Kaedues steps closer to Daniel now with a curious look on his face.* **"A win?"**


[6/10/2023 10:40 PM] Danny Donovan
**"Um, yeah. Me and her father go way back so we typically have biz with one another. He has always been difficult. But, after the whole accident I am taking the brunt of his wrath."** He realized he was getting too deep into the lore of him and Freddie. **"Don't worry about too much. I got another friend I would like for you to meet as well who resides here in Fairview later today or tomorrow. Got to make sure work is in order before I go giving you a tour around the area."** He was beginning to walk off, heading deeper into the Condo.


[6/10/2023 10:43 PM] Kaedues Staub
**"If I leave, are you going to be here by the time I get back?"** *Kaedues calls out as Danny walks off.*


[6/10/2023 10:46 PM] Danny Donovan
**"Yeah, I will be working from home today."**


[6/10/2023 10:48 PM] Kaedues Staub
**"Alright. Thanks again for arranging my stay, Danny. I'm gonna go take a walk."** *Kaedues says before he walks towards the exit to Danny's condo.*

[6/28/2023 1:23 AM] Narration
Kaedues made his way back to the Condo. It was quiet, the atmosphere enveloped in a hushed stillness. However, amidst the prevailing silence, he discerned the faint sound of shuffling emanating beyond the living room and into the hallway.


[6/28/2023 6:14 PM] Kaedues Staub
*A faint chirping noise plays from behind the door, and then it opens up. Kaedues walks into the house where he suddenly blends in a whole lot more. His red and white tracksuit beams off the same magnetizing red color that the floor and furniture are coated with.*

*Now Kaedues looks and listens around for people or shelves. Since he can't find the latter he looks for the former. Eventually Kaedues finds himself moving towards the origin of the shuffling sounds he hears within the condo.*


[6/29/2023 12:39 AM] Narration
The origin of the alluring noise was coming from behind a door. The frame was made of sleek metal, while the middle was made of semi-transparent glass. The contents beyond the door were warped and twisted as the light bent as it passed Kaedues' optics. 

Despite the contorted visuals, he could make out a person on the far side of the room. Seated in front of something with their head lower, focused on what was in front of them, no doubt.


[6/29/2023 2:24 PM] Kaedues Staub
*As the red-haired man approaches that dark and steely door he begins to fold the clothing underneath his arm. Peering through the glass, Kaedues can't assume much. Danny's condo is uniform in design... The person within is probably Danny, so Kaedues gives a hearty knock to the door.* **"Hey, anyone in there?"**


[7/3/2023 3:08 AM] Narration
There was a subtle repositioning, as if the person behind had cast a glance back towards the door, before beckoning them inside with a welcoming tone. **"Door's unlocked, come on in."**


[7/3/2023 11:37 AM] Kaedues Staub
*Kaedues opens the door as prompted. He doesn't start talking yet in case he would be intruding on something.*


[7/5/2023 12:27 PM] Narration
As Kaedues swung the door open, he noticed the figure on the far end of the room had already refocused on the task at hand. It was Danny, which wasn’t surprising given that the kids were at school and his wife was at work.

Danny was hunched over a workbench reminiscent of the one in his designated space at Shop 1113. It was a tableau of orderliness with tools and bins meticulously arranged, each labeled and color-coded for optimized accessibility – though Kaedues could have speculated that Danny’s wife may have had a hand in enforcing this degree of organization. The room was capacious, and the walls were adorned with boards bearing sketches, blueprints, and a medley of accolades Danny had earned during his tenure at BioTek.

To Kaedues' right, an elegant spiral staircase coiled its way to the second floor of the condo. The railing was crafted from polished, lustrous marble and paired with sleek glass panes that extended down to the semi-transparent steps. A mannequin stood between Kaedues and the staircase, practically bristling with an array of gadgets that Danny likely engineered. Tubes meandered down its limbs, converging into an intricate interplay of metal and plastics. The chest was hollowed out, but within it was a labyrinthine tangle of wires, encasing what appeared to be synthetic organs. Fascinating!


[7/5/2023 12:27 PM] Danny Donovan
**"No one gave you any trouble while you were out there did they?"** Danny's voice echoed through the high ceiling room, his back still turned towards Kaedues as he continued to focus on his work.


[7/5/2023 1:33 PM] Kaedues Staub
*Kaedues observes the meticulous and orderly workspace as he comes up with the answer to Danny's question. He doesn't have time to take the exact position of things to heart yet. Kaedues stays at the doorway as a sign of respect for Danny's working space. He also pauses in response to Danny's question; He planned to shrug it off but...*

**"What do you know about Aurora King?"**


[7/6/2023 12:06 AM] Danny Donovan
**"Aurora King... Doesn't ring any bells. Names aren't exactly my forte."** His elbows bobbed up and down, the symphony of plastics clicking into place emanating from the workbench.


[7/6/2023 12:14 AM] Kaedues Staub
**"Alright well thanks anyway. Do you have anywhere I could set my jumpsuit down?"** *Kaedues continues to scan the room quietly; He does not snoop but he familiarizes himself enough.*


[7/6/2023 12:18 AM] Danny Donovan
He would respond, **"Just drop them over by the crates on the left. Don't rummage through them much, so they'll be fine there."**


[7/6/2023 12:52 AM] Kaedues Staub
*Kaedues follows Danny's instruction to a T. His new clothes make a vinyl rubbing sound as he moves around, something he is still not used to.* **"I'm off to run some errands."** *Kaedues hesitates for a moment before choking out another bit of dialogue;* **"Do you-- want anything when I come back?"** *The way Kaedues asks a question like this sounds very forced.*


[7/6/2023 12:56 AM] Danny Donovan
Danny hit pause on his tinkering and craned his neck over his shoulder to give Kaedues a once-over. First, he mulled over the question that was posed, and then his gaze lingered on Kaedues' fresh attire. It was a striking look, no doubt, but the absence of his signature overalls was jarring in its own way. But then, Danny conceded mentally, Fairview called for a step-up in wardrobe choices. **"I am all set, Kaedues. Appreciate it."**


[7/6/2023 12:59 AM] Danny Donovan
Rising from his work, Danny extended a hand towards Kaedues, his fingers adorned with metallic rings, likely to augment his efficiency on his current project. **"Ah, before you head out... My kids will probably be back by the time you return. Don't let them bother you too much, the eldest is fine... It's the young ones I worry about, haha!"**


[7/8/2023 2:27 PM] Kaedues Staub
*Kaedues nods to Danny, understanding of his warning. He doesn't really bat an eye at it otherwise.* **"I'll try not to be a bad influence on them, for your sake."** *He chuckles a little saying that before turning to leave. Now that Kaedues' hands are free his work comes next.*

[9/22/2024 2:53 AM] Narration
It did not take Kaedues long to return to Danny's condo. As luck would have it, it began to rain after he found refuge inside the building. The sound of a screaming child welcomed Kaedues to the house. In fact, it wasn't terror, but excitement and rambunctiousness. Inside, the living room was a whirlwind of activity, with toys scattered across the floor and colorful drawings taped to the walls.


[9/22/2024 11:48 PM] Kaedues Staub
*Kaedues steps into the condo with a prodding thought in the back of his head. He looks around the living room and notices the toys. That's right, Danny mentioned he had kids... just don't tell them any workplace stories.*

*(Is it safe to say that they're looking for him?)*

*Kaedues steps into the living room.* **"Danny, are you home?"** *he speaks up, loud enough to be heard if Danny was inside. Kaedues' tongue rolls across the roof of his mouth, feeling a shallow groove left by a crumpled paper ball. When he ate the note he gave Aurora.*

***__`("..didn't meant that. Forget I said anything.")`__***

*Kaedues looks at his hands-- hand-- and recalls everything that he just went over with the cop in Park 6. He feels like he is jumping to conclusions, so.. for good measure,*

***__`("..shop 1113.. You are familiar with Danny Donovan, no?")`__***
*(She's familiar with the shop and knows Danny works there. She could have just commented, but she questioned me about it.)*
***__`("..either you're here illegally, or someone vouched for you.")`__***
*(Danny vouched for me. I don't think she knows that. What about this is so difficult?)*

*Kaedues sits down on the couch and closes his eyes. He can't picture her face quite right, or the tone of her voice..*

***__`("Did someone bring you to fairview?")`__***
*(Where I come from, the police would have assumed that I am illegal. Maybe they operate differently here.)*

***__`("Identification or another missing hand and prison time.")`__***
*(Can't operate too differently.)*

*Kaedues shakes his head. He had only sat down for a few moments, so all the thinking disoriented him. He furrows his brow and presses his lips shut.*


[9/23/2024 12:01 AM] Narration
As Kaedues' mind churned and processed away, he would feel a sensation. A sensation like a sixth sense.

The house was quiet. when did that occur? It wasn't long ago that there was screaming.


[9/23/2024 12:11 AM] Kaedues Staub
*Kaedues stands up and over to where he heard the yelling from. He decides to go investigate, just to put the pieces together. He's in that kind of headspace right now, anyway.*

*As Kaedues walks, he adjusts the fabric of his jumpsuit around his collar and the backs of his knees. This new piece of athletic wear bunches up in ways he doesn't like.*
*Where was the noise coming from after all? What does Kaedues see when moving towards there?*


[9/23/2024 12:26 AM] Narration
Kaedues did not have to go far at all to find the source of said ruckus. For the source of the noise came to him. As he rounded the couch, he noticed a young girl staring at him from her hiding spot. Which was behind the corner of a wall that connected the hallway and the living room.


[9/23/2024 12:26 AM] Mia Donovan
**Stare......** The little girl was curious about him. But not enough curiosity could prompt her to confront him directly. Instead, she felt that watching him was the best course of action. The two locked eyes with about 4 meters separating the two.


[9/23/2024 12:31 AM] Kaedues Staub

[9/23/2024 12:35 AM] Mia Donovan
The girl narrowed her eyes, a faint illumination reflecting on the glossy surface of her iris. Data scrolling down the height of her eye. When whatever data was compiled, she relaxed her gaze and continued the now official staring contest. **". . ."***


[9/23/2024 12:39 AM] Kaedues Staub
*Kaedues pauses for a moment when he sees her. He still wasn't planning to have to talk to the kids. Couldn't they just ignore him? It's easier.*

*He feels like he is at risk of creating a bad situation. Kids do that. Maybe if he chooses his words carefully, he could avoid something like that. Start nice and easy, don't jump the gun and ask about Danny. Use soft language.*

**"Do you know why I'm here?"**


[9/23/2024 12:41 AM] Mia Donovan
**"Mmhmm."** She nodded. But that was all.


[9/23/2024 12:43 AM] Mia Donovan
She just stood there as if she was expecting him to do something. Though, what that could be was a mystery.


[9/23/2024 12:51 AM] Kaedues Staub
*Kaedues nods slowly and thinks for a moment again.*

**"Call me Kaedues. Is Danny home right now?"** *he asks casually.*


[9/23/2024 12:53 AM] Mia Donovan
She thinks for a moment before vanishing into the hallway. Her feet thumped against the hard floors as she moved deeper and deeper into the condo.


[9/23/2024 12:57 AM] Danny Donovan
Moments later, Danny waltzes out into the living room, alert for Kaedues. When he sees Kaedues, Danny grinned. **"Ah, you're back. Hanging in there so far?"**


[9/23/2024 1:07 AM] Kaedues Staub
*Kaedues takes a long breath in.... and lets it out. The sound of his breath flying from his nose implies he is leveling himself.*

**"..Yeah. I got a job done and tried food from a street vendor. I need to tell you something, though."**
*Kaedues seems to catch his breath on the way out. Maybe he had stopped himself from speaking.* **"......Do you have a minute?"**


[9/23/2024 1:10 AM] Danny Donovan
The smile from his face worked its way down a tad. Sounded important. **"Sure, finished up my work. What is it?"**


[9/23/2024 1:16 AM] Kaedues Staub
*Since Kaedues still hasn't really come full circle on what is going on, he doesn't have a problem with spilling it out in the open.*

**"The last person I talked to was a cop. I think they are looking for you."**

*Kaedues looks right at Danny. His expression is.. well, it's basically like it usually is. Kaedues doesn't really joke around too much, especially not like this. Safe to say he's serious.*


[9/23/2024 1:27 AM] Danny Donovan
He paused for a few seconds before raising his chin and looking off to the side. To complete the nod going downward, Danny cupped his chin. Rubbing it as he contemplated the information. **"Uhuh....I wonder why that would be."** 

He took this time to walk around the living room for a moment. **"I don't think I did anything wrong. You sure?"** He finally asked, turning back to him.


[9/23/2024 1:37 AM] Kaedues Staub
*Kaedues watches Danny as he paces and doesn't think much of it.*

**"I'm not accusing you, and she mentioned you by name. To be honest with you, I'm not certain."** *Kaedues lets out a long sigh.* **"There is just something about the way that she spoke to me. She was very insistent on finding out how I got here, and then, who brought me."**

*Kaedues blinks. He remembers Aurora again, freaking out about something she said. He can't really remember what. Danny keeps his composure though. He is mulling it over sure, but he isn't cracking. Kaedues nods to himself; that seems about right. Danny is headstrong.*


[9/24/2024 8:59 PM] Danny Donovan
He shrugged as his mind began to process the information. **"Well, if they haven't shown up at the door yet, it must not be anything major. Though, I am unsure as to why the authorities would be looking for me specifically.."** 

Then, a dangerous thought occurred to him...

A thought so vile that Danny's mind could not have conjured such a horrid idea alone. Like a foreign force whispered into his ears. Danny's pupils dilated, the blood running through his veins froze and turned into slush. **"No.."** he said under his breath. He turned to Kaedues. **"Did she happen to tell you her name by any chance?"** Danny was visibly disturbed at this thought.


[9/24/2024 9:10 PM] Kaedues Staub
**"...No. She didn't tell me her name. She was young, maybe my age. Had her eyebrows done and wore makeup."** *Kaedues observes Danny's distressed expression and takes a mental note of it.*

**"..She was very snippy."** *Kaedues adds after a moment or three.* **"If it helps, I can draw a picture."**


[9/24/2024 9:13 PM] Kaedues Staub
*Kaedues does absolutely nothing to try and console Danny-- the thought does not even cross his mind. In times like this, Kaedues jumps to problem solving.*

*and what a problem it seems to be. Kaedues fishes in his pocket for something, but comes up empty handed. He rubs his fingers against his palm uncomfortably.*

[9/24/2024 9:24 PM] Danny Donovan
He took a few deep breaths to center himself, but even then, the notion of this woman coming around would keep him on the edge of his seat. **"Okay...okay.. I don't think it's anyone I've had contact with before. The CCR should NOT be looking for me."** Danny sat on the armrest of his couch. The weight of it caused the rest of the furniture piece to bounce up a little. It was obvious Danny was not a light man. He looked back up to Kaedues. **"You don't need to worry about drawing a picture."** His eyes would flick from Kaedues to the corners of his eyes. Accessing his contacts and calling someone.


[9/24/2024 9:45 PM] Kaedues Staub
*Kaedues' arms dangle at his sides. His fingers continuously rub together, creating a very subtle dry noise in the background for both himself and Danny. He rolls his tongue against the roof of his mouth. His face twists in an almost imperceptible way.*

*All the while, Kaedues is completely transfixed on Danny. He stares into the big man's eyes for what could be considered an uncomfortable amount of time, if Danny even notices.*
*(...Danny is a large part of the shop's work flow. For some reason, I can't let myself ration out him being investigated by the cops.)*

**"..mm.."**

*Slowly, Kaedues closes his eyes. He re-assesses what he knows. He had a gut feeling that something of this flavor would turn up-- the completely unfounded kind.*

*He flips his thinking on his head, and assumes for a moment that Danny is a criminal person of interest.*
***__`"You are familiar with Danny Donovan, no?"`__***
*(Probing. Not casual questioning.)*
***__`"Identification or another missing hand and prison time."`__***
*(Interrogating is common for CCR lawmen. Just because it happens often doesn't mean this means nothing.)*
***__`"I don't think I did anything wrong. You sure?"`__***
*(Said by Danny moments ago. He sounded usual.)*
***__`"The CCR should NOT be looking for me."`__***
*(And only moments after, he said this. If I skew these to line up with the idea of him actually doing something criminal...)*

*Kaedues opens his eyes and looks at Danny again.*
*(It would mean that.. Danny is a liar. In order for this situation to play out how it did under that pretense, Danny would have had to have been lying to me for.. a very long time.)*

*After another moment, Kaedues turns to the side and cringes a little.*
*(But.. that doesn't make any sense.)*


[9/24/2024 9:56 PM] Danny Donovan
**"Fred, we need to talk."** He finally spoke, Danny's voice taking on a serious tone which was a rare occurrence. His eyes hardened as he looked forward. **"In person, I got too many ears here. Where can I see you? Send me the coordinates.."**


[9/24/2024 10:02 PM] Kaedues Staub
*Kaedues' softening gaze begins to straighten again, tighten as he hears Danny speak like this.*
*Danny's body language, expressions, and tone of voice have all changed. This isn't out of the ordinary for most people, but Kaedues can't remember the last time Danny broke his smile.*

*He fired the Photon Falcon's gatling gun and smiled the whole way through. Kaedues remembers that.*


[9/24/2024 10:09 PM] Danny Donovan
**"I'll be there in 20 minutes."** He finally said, standing up and immediately moving to retrieve his coat and put on his shoes.


[9/24/2024 10:16 PM] Kaedues Staub
*Kaedues watches Danny. His thoughts begin to race forward, They get faster and faster, threatening to strip our Gopher of his composure, his fortitude. What if those thoughts are even close to being true? What does that mean for Danny?*

*Something quiet slows them down. Something trustworthy. Something helpful.*

:KaeO: :KaeR: :kaeD: :kaeE: :KaeR: :kae1: 

*Kaedues shakes his head. He wants to ask Danny something. Ask him if you can help. Ask him what is wrong.*
**"Should I cover for you?"** *is all that comes out.*

[9/24/2024 10:31 PM] Danny Donovan
Danny was in the midst of walking past him and grabbing his coat from a rack, but stopped in his tracks and looked to his left where Kaedues stood. He paused and smiled a little. **"Nah. It's alright."**

He then resumed walking toward the door, but was interrupted yet again. But not by a person. A little girl had ran into his leg. Oh, it was Mia again!


[9/24/2024 10:31 PM] Mia Donovan
**"Dad!"** Mia shouted as she looked up to Danny. **"You're not leaving, are you?"**


[9/24/2024 10:31 PM] Danny Donovan
He bent down to look at her eye level and patted her head. **"Hey, kiddo. Sorry, dad has some stuff to do."** He then stood back up. **"It'll only be for a couple of hours. I'll be back."** He assured kissing her forehead before standing. Someone else caught his eye that was still in the hallway.


[9/24/2024 10:31 PM] Sophie Donovan
It was his oldest daughter, leaning against the wall. Observing her father with cold eyes. **"..."**


[9/24/2024 10:31 PM] Danny Donovan
He gave her a look as if to communicate 'watch over things'. To which she nodded. She had a duty, and knew it. Kaedues wasn't familiar with his family and considered if he should leave him here or bring Kaedues with him. If he left Kaedues here and the CCR showed up, knowing he had a run-in with them before, things could escalate. At least if he brought him along, the risks were only smaller by a small margin.. **"Kaedues, why don't you come along, eh? We are going to the hospital where Grace is staying. You can say hi while I talk with Fred."**


[9/24/2024 10:36 PM] Kaedues Staub
**"..Sure. Not like I have.."** *There's a dull sensation in his stomach. Grace? That's.. his coworker. No, that's-- that's __Grace__ he's talking about. He blinks a few times.* **"..Yeah, I want to come with you."**

*(What? What just happened?)*

*Kaedues looks over to his jumpsuit folded on the couch.* **"Hold on. I have to fix something."** *Kaedues walks over to the suit and fishes through its pockets, pulling out a packet of coconut flavored gum. As he walks back toward Danny, he pops one of the pieces into his mouth.*


[9/24/2024 10:47 PM] Danny Donovan
Danny was driving through the rain-soaked city roads in his vehicle. His eyes were dead set on the road. His jaw clenched slightly as he remained silent through the drive. It was not normal for him to remain quiet like this, so this change in demeanor was quite the shift. Every once and a while he would glance over his shoulder to check for any followers or suspicious vehicles, only to return to looking straight forward. He had a lot on his mind at this moment. **"..."**


[9/24/2024 10:54 PM] Kaedues Staub
*Kaedues spends the first couple minutes in the car silent as well. Something about the scenery, the quiet, the ambience of the car's engine and the rolling wheels provokes Kaedues. Suddenly, he feels paralyzed instead of relaxed. The feeling is eerily, hauntingly familiar to Kaedues.*

[9/24/2024 11:08 PM] Kaedues Staub
*It comes without warning, and out of nowhere. An out of body experience mirroring the dream he had earlier. His voice will not respond to him no matter what he wants, or how much he wants it.*

*There isn't any music playing in the car, but Kaedues can still hear it. Faintly. Very faintly. The drums.*
*Externally, nothing is different about Kaedues. It is not like how he was behind the driver's seat.*

*The more he tries to speak, the more apprehensive he feels about it. There is a question floating in the air, and every time he reaches out, tries to touch, it flutters away. Kaedues stays silent for the first half or so of the car ride before he can't handle the feeling anymore. He focuses desperately, undeterred, at formulating that invisible phrase. He squeezes his eyes shut.*

**"You..."** *Kadues feels the words catch in his throat.* **"Why do.."**
*Kaedues' face twists into something frustrated, something stressed.* **"..It.."** *He holds his hand up to his face and presses his fingers against his forehead-- so hard that his knuckles turn white.* **"What..?"**


[9/24/2024 11:12 PM] Danny Donovan
Danny looked over towards Kadeues, his brow furrowed in an attempt to make sense of what Kaedues was d-. 
Someone ran out in the middle of the road on Danny which prompted him to slam on his brakes. **"SHIT!"**


[9/24/2024 11:12 PM] Narration
The car screeched to a halt just before hitting the guy. Who jumped and looked at Danny like he was an idiot. **"Watch it you fucking moron!"**


[9/24/2024 11:12 PM] Danny Donovan
He collected himself, rolling down the window and shouting back at him. **"Learn how to read posted signs!"** He'd retort at the man who kept walking. Giving Danny the finger.


[9/24/2024 11:43 PM] Kaedues Staub
*Kaedues had no time to prepare, no time to even think about if something like this could have happened. When the car lurches forward, Kaedues' hand and arm fly forward to grasp the car's dashboard.*

*Recent memory flashes through Kaedues' conscious like a photo book being flipped through. The drums have become deafeningly loud, louder than the car horn, louder than the shouting. His hand trembles against the surface of the car's interior, the texture his fingers find themself on becoming black noise.*

-# ***__`"Danny has not come in yet."`__***                             ***__`"Hey, man! I got your number through...whatever his name was."`__***

-# ***__`"You think you got it all figured out, don't you?"`__***                 ***__`"I can't quite comprehend why it feels so intense."`__***

***__`"It's the only way I can keep going."`__***

*It all happens in the span of a couple seconds at best. Kaedues breathes in, letting the air completely fill his lungs. He focuses on that for now, just breathing in and out. It takes a few breaths before he can process what is going on around him.*

*He lifts his hand off the dashboard as if it was attached to a thousand-pound weight. Slowly, he curls his finger and places his knuckle between his teeth. The stony feeling of his teeth closing around his finger and splitting his skin brings Kaedues back down to earth. He is overwhelmed, but the pain is him. The resistance of his flesh is him. The taste of blood is him.*

*He's shaking. Kaedues does not realize it, but he's shaking. If Danny spoke to him at all during this time, he didn't hear a word of it. The drums* *`cement themselves as background noise. Kaedues takes a deep breath in, trying to get over this feeling.`*


[9/24/2024 11:47 PM] Danny Donovan
**"Hey!"** He'd shout.  Hoping that he could pull Kaedues out of whatever state he was in.


[9/24/2024 11:56 PM] Kaedues Staub
*`Kaedues turns to Danny after a moment to process. He takes a breath in and then out.`*
**`"....I'm here."`**

*`He retrieves his hand from his mouth and lets his arms come to his sides.`*
**`"...Let's go,"`** *`Kaedues says without any explanation. He looks at Danny when he says it, and at the road shortly thereafter.`*


[9/25/2024 12:03 AM] Danny Donovan
**"Okay......okay..."** Danny exhaled himself before continuing on his way to the hospital.


[9/25/2024 12:09 AM] Kaedues Staub
*`Kaedues blinks long and slowly. There is a long, especially long and possibly uncomfortable pause before he speaks up again.`*
**`"Why are we visiting Grace right now?"`** *`he asks.`*


[9/25/2024 12:11 AM] Danny Donovan
**"I need to talk to her father about something. He just so happens to be at the hospital where she is at."** He turned the wheel left, merging onto a major road.


[9/25/2024 12:14 AM] Kaedues Staub
**`"..Fuck."`** *`Kaedues says with a worried tone and a sigh. He turns his head away from Danny and looks out of the car window.`*


[9/25/2024 12:22 AM] Narration
The rest of the ride went smoothly... As it could.

[10/13/2024 8:29 PM] Narration
It was early in the morning and within Danny's condo was the presence of silence, saved for the ambient hum of the appliances that worked around the clock. The silence was broken only by the artificial sounds of blinds opening. Special windows lined two walls. During the night, they were opaque with hexagonal grove patterns. Now, the windows had turned translucent and projected the view of the outside world through digital displays. 

As before, that same noisy drone would fly across the room from its charging base. Ready to serve the apartment's inhabitants. Though, there was no one in the living room space at the time. It would go on to broadcast the news regardless.


[10/13/2024 8:46 PM] Kaedues Staub
*From one end of Danny's condo behind the bathroom door come the muffled and dampened sounds of water pounding a porcelain floor. Those sounds are cut short with an audible squeak. The door opens after a moment or two and produces a plume of steam and vapor.. and Kaedues.*

*Kaedues had clothed himself before he left the bathroom-- so he is a little damp. This would fix itself in the following minutes, or at least, it usually does. He leaves the bathroom open a crack so the humidity can level out and moves to the living room to sit on the couch.*


[10/13/2024 9:00 PM] Narration
Kaedues made his way around the coffee table to plop on the couch. While sitting down, not much time later, the sounds of footsteps in a nearby hallway can be heard. Too many steps for it to be one person, that is for sure. Then, emerging from the adjacent hallway behind Kaedues came Danny's daughters, leaving for school.
The drone failed to make its scripted morning message to Kaedues, but did not dare to falter when the girls made their way to the door.

 **"Greetings! I hope this message finds you well. I wanted to bring your attention to the current weather conditions, which displa—"**


[10/13/2024 9:00 PM] Sophie Donovan
**"Shut up.."** Sophie commanded the drone which did exactly that. It's display turned off and moved out of their way.


[10/13/2024 9:00 PM] Mia Donovan
Mia, the youngest was excited to start the new day, skipping towards the door. **"I cannot wait for school!"**


[10/13/2024 9:00 PM] Sophie Donovan
**"I can."** Sophie rolled her eyes as she went to unlock the door. The door was opened and Mia ran out the door, but Sophie paused to turn back to look at the living room where she spotted Kaedues sitting there on the couch.

[10/13/2024 9:06 PM] Kaedues Staub
*Kaedues makes eye contact with Sophie and says nothing. At first he looks at her, but he quickly looks past her-- through her. He feels out of order.. upset? Should he be upset?*

*Something that happened recently is very much interrupting Kaedues' state of mind.*


[10/13/2024 9:10 PM] Sophie Donovan
Sophie didn't smile at Kaedues, but didn't frown either. Instead her eyes narrowed at the man, then she stepped out and turned back towards the door so that she could watch him until it automatically closed. Moments later, the lock engaged.

[10/13/2024 9:16 PM] Kaedues Staub
*Kaedues re-focuses on Sophie and assumes she has a reason for looking like that-- he shakes it off. It's hard-wired for him not to take those things personally.*


[10/13/2024 9:16 PM] Kaedues Staub
*He also disengages from the exchange by looking up at the ceiling.*


[10/13/2024 9:24 PM] Narration
How long was it that he was looking up at the ceiling? Who knows, because it would have seemed that it was an instant when Danny's voice reverberated through the living room.


[10/13/2024 9:24 PM] Danny Donovan
**"Kaedues, you're up early."** He commented as he came out into the living room, already dressed for the day. He stopped short of standing at the couch's arm. He was still groggy physically, but one could tell his mind was sharp, reeling about the events from the night before. He had to make an effort to keep his shoulders upright.


[10/13/2024 9:27 PM] Kaedues Staub
**"I get up around now every day."** *Kaedues promptly stands up and looks at Danny. His expression shifts a little as he also recalls some things from last night.* **"Do you have somewhere to be?"**


[10/13/2024 10:08 PM] Danny Donovan
Danny sighed heavily, walking around the couch to stand near where Kaedues had been. **"I do... unfortunately. But first, we need to talk about yesterday and the whole.. ordeal. I'm sure you have your own thoughts about it as well."** He would look down at Kaedues' knees, organizing his thoughts. His own expression changed as well. It was hardening.


[10/13/2024 10:17 PM] Kaedues Staub
**"Thinking about it very much makes my head ache,"** *Kaedues puts simply. He looks up at Danny. His expression is plain, refreshed from a long night's sleep.* **"but I do want to talk. There was something.."** *Kaedues pauses for a moment.* **"..The deal. The chance."** *Kaedues' eyes narrow a little.* **"Is that it?"**


[10/13/2024 10:23 PM] Danny Donovan
He would sit down, opposite from Kaedues. **"Yesterday, when Rhett first talked to us about killing Paige and I and Freddie being... You know... I agreed to it, because that is what he wanted to hear. And truthfully, I was terrified. I couldn't risk anything else happening to the family. That was the right answer at the time. But I've had a long night to think about this."** Danny said, with a slight tilt to his head, he looked Kaedues in the eye. **"I'm not going to follow through with the plan. Paige will have to die at some point, there is no other way. However, I don't plan to stick around in District 9 and let Rhett take me away from my family."**


[10/13/2024 10:28 PM] Danny Donovan
Danny paused again, letting out a heavy exhale and closing his eyes for a moment. **"You remember Freddie, right? Well, he'll do everything he can to save Grace from Rhett. Rhett's deal was for both of us to die to save our families. Since I am not willing to go, that means I'm... essentially screwing him out of a daughter..."** 

He would let that one settle in.

**"I'm confident Rhett knows one of us will likely not follow through. He is probably banking on it, but I'm not going to wait and see how that plays out."** Danny explains further, opening his eyes and watching Kaedues. **"Freddie is on his own. I will be betraying him by leaving. He might come for us, or Rhett might.. I don't know who to worry about first. Either way, it doesn't matter. I just can't let either of those things happen. I can't. My family. __Needs__. Me."**


[10/13/2024 10:39 PM] Kaedues Staub
*As Danny continues to explain his plan to Kaedues, his face shifts here and there in an almost inperceptible way. With Danny's decision to __watch__ Kaedues, he may pick up on his own discomfort.*

*He goes to say something, but closes his mouth. There again he watches himself slip and stutter, not really comfortable with the way his thoughts spiral out and away.*

**"Freddie looks old. Older than you."** *He states, not revealing exactly what he is thinking. He laces his fingers together and begins to bounce one of his legs up and down.*


[10/13/2024 10:49 PM] Danny Donovan
**"He's old, yes, but he's got more experience than me and more knowledge than I care to admit. Before we departed from our group years ago, he had the most cracked out augmentations. I'm not even sure what all he had, and that is what is dangerous. He has an advantage, no matter how you look at it."** Danny answers, keeping his focus on the leg bouncing.


[10/13/2024 10:52 PM] Kaedues Staub
**"If your places were swapped, would I have heard him sing your praises just now?"** *He asks snappily, as if he had the question primed. The rhythm that Kaedues' leg bounces at shifts slightly, slower.*


[10/13/2024 10:56 PM] Danny Donovan
Danny shook his head and spoke firmly, **"No."**


[10/13/2024 11:05 PM] Kaedues Staub
*Kaedues' leg stops for a second, but only for a second. He closes his eyes.*

*A swell of air fills his lungs. It is flushed out as quickly as it came in. His eyes open, fixed on Danny.* **"I need to know some things about the group you were in,"** *he leads.*


[10/13/2024 11:06 PM] Danny Donovan
**"...Ask away. Not like I've been entirely tight lipped these last 12 hours."** He replied.


[10/13/2024 11:09 PM] Kaedues Staub
**"Why was the group made?"**


[10/13/2024 11:22 PM] Danny Donovan
Danny looked up at the ceiling, and took another moment to think back on the time. He spoke, **"The group formed organically. It wasn't made. Discontent CCR special operatives were looking to defect, others wanted revenge on their government.. and still, others wanted a fresh start. A lot of people in one room with a similar goal of escaping their past life. The group didn't really have an identity until the members started sticking it directly to the CCR. Before we knew it, Horizon Grey was 'made'. Or at least how I know of its inception."**


[10/13/2024 11:26 PM] Kaedues Staub
**"What kind of environment did you work in usually?"** *Kaedues nods in response to the information, quickly registering it.*


[10/13/2024 11:34 PM] Danny Donovan
**"Away from the CCR's influence most of the time. Got too big, left the districts. Most of our operation bases were out in 'The Haze'... You wouldn't know what its like... It's very nasty outside these walls. We fought in the grey haze that plagues the landscape. Fighting over tech and resources over the bigger CCR and Brillion armies. That in itself is another big can of bolts to unpack..."**


[10/13/2024 11:40 PM] Kaedues Staub
**"Most of them did not get offered deals like you did,"** *Kaedues states.* **"If there are still members alive they are hiding?"**


[10/13/2024 11:43 PM] Danny Donovan
**"__IF__ they are still alive, they are most certainly in hiding. The CCR had all of our bases on a map and hit them all at once... I doubt there are more than a handful. It is beyond me how Paige survived... But I guess that is what we get for not killing her ourselves. Only four of us were granted asylum."**


[10/17/2024 12:12 AM] Kaedues Staub
*Kaedues breathes in slowly and brings himself to his feet in front of Danny. When his breath leaves his lungs it carries a soft tone with it.*

**"... Okay. What do you need? Transport? Anything manufactured?"**

*Kaedues reaches into his pocket and pulls out his packet of coconut bubblegum. The package itself is heavily worn, smashed flat and ripped up from the earlier crash. Kaedues still takes out a piece of strip gum from the package and tosses it into his mouth; chewing it provides a familiar and soothing feeling to Kaedues.*

[10/17/2024 12:15 AM] Kaedues Staub
**".. I should probably ask your friend the same thing. Both of you are going to do the same thing, I bet."**

*Kaedues stops himself, interjecting his own train of thought--*

**"To be clear, your family is not in witness protection? Neither is Grace?"**


[12/8/2024 7:19 PM] Danny Donovan
**"There was witness protection until Rhett began hounding us. He can strip it away at any given time. Especially with the whole current situation right now. For what I need? ... I am not one hundred percent sure, but I have a solid idea on what needs to be done on my end."** 

Danny was weary about Kaedues' comment on asking Freddie the same questions. If anything, he did not want Kaedues going anywhere near Freddie or Grace since he was concerned that he'll leak something or perhaps help Freddie and Grace solely. Kaedues has been nothing but helpful however, surely he wouldn't do that? Nah, can't be too sure... He'll have to tread carefully with who he associated with.

Danny stood up, swinging his arms as he did so. A distant but focused gaze set upon his face, his line of sight peering out the morning skyline. After a moment of pause, he turned his head towards Kaedues as if he made up his mind. **"I need to run to the workshop today. Get my equipment from my workspace... You're welcomed to come along, unless you intend to go seek out Freddie and Grace."** Perhaps this was a test to gauge Kaedues' priorities and perhaps selfishly, his loyalty?


[12/8/2024 11:00 PM] Kaedues Staub
*Kaedues begins to develop a chewing rhythm with the gum. He gently balls his right hand closed; His thumb rubs against his index finger in a circular pattern.*

*He frankly stares at Danny and listens to what he says carefully. When Danny turns to look at him, Kaedues pauses for a few seconds-- all the while his gaze laying heavy on the man in front of him.*

*Kaedues punctuates himself by swallowing the gum. His eyebrows lower if only by a hair. He raises his left arm to show his missing hand.*
**"Do you know anyone who can attach a prosthetic here?"** *He asks plainly.*


[12/9/2024 12:08 AM] Danny Donovan
Danny would tilt his head left and right, indicating it's a yes, but with some strings attached...

**"Fairview has no doctors who will be interested in helping you, and the ones I have in mind only serve citizens of Fairview."** There was a brief pause, after which he seemed confident of his answer until it was interrupted by a dangerous reminder. 

**"Well, actually.... yes, there is one, but... It would be difficult to contact him since CCR are currently holding him in relation to this Paige issue."** He explained.


[12/9/2024 12:15 AM] Kaedues Staub
**"Holding him how? Do you know, or have an idea?"** *He asks swiftly. His arm lowers to his side. His eyes remain fixed on Danny. He may have forgotten to blink, or maybe he's so focused on something it slipped his natural habits.*


[12/9/2024 12:18 AM] Danny Donovan
He'd shrug, **"No clue, Rhett commented on capturing Kode at the hospital but did not detail any more than that."**


[12/9/2024 12:24 AM] Kaedues Staub
*Kaedues closes his eyes now and slips his five fingers into his head of hair. He pauses for another moment, and without moving he responds.*

**"..I'll follow you to the workshop."** *he says slowly, carefully.*


[12/9/2024 12:26 AM] Danny Donovan
**"Alright."** He said flatly. A single nod of his head and he moved to retrieve his jacket. **"Then we should get to it then. Time isn't so kind to me right now."**


[12/9/2024 12:29 AM] Kaedues Staub
*Kaedues nods as well. He takes a soft breath in and out, and stands by the door.*
