This is Cat's Vid Shop in Haven Heights, a hot spot that is sure to please. In line with tradition, the place was crowded as usual. Each aisle was occupied by people who were separated by shelves containing hundreds to thousands of brain dance videos. Brain dance had become the craze among youths over the last few years. In the shop, customers would be able to select from a wide variety of videos to watch.


[5/16/2023 3:40 PM] Cat Bayes
*The shop wasn't all that big, definitely not a corporate building for sure! The walls that weren't covered by the shelves of BD tapes were lined with various posters, some generic "Hang-in-There" cats hanging on a tree branch, some busty models of male and female porn-stars alike, and some were just too faded or covered in graffiti to really distinguish.

*The owner of the store, an Asian girl named Cat Bayes, sat behind her usual counter as she read through her magazines whilst smoking a cigarette. She didn't look to be older than 23, with dark bluish hair that matched her aqua marine eyes. As per usual, she had a dark leather jacket on, with a grey T-shirt on.*

*Of course, none of the customers needed to actually talk to Cat unless they wanted to rent a BD or needed help with setting one up, her regs already knew how to use the chairs, and the chairs automatically make the transactions for them when they load up the BD, so for the most part, she was getting paid to chill out for twelve hours.*

[5/16/2023 4:52 PM] Narration
In the store, the door chime no longer worked and even if it did, it would not work. Due to the sheer volume of people entering and leaving the store, Cat would have no choice but to prop the door open. Defeating its purpose. That allowed a little specific someone to waltz right up to the front counter without forewarning.


[5/16/2023 4:52 PM] Paige
**"Hey Cat, how's the shift treatin' ya?** Ah, a regular! She strolled in with her arms swaying before lifting and dropping them on the counter. Her fingertips held onto the edge, and she grinned wide.


[5/16/2023 6:01 PM] Cat Bayes
**"Mmh?"** *Tapping twice on the side of her head, the mental music that was blaring in her head suddenly paused as she looked up from her reading material, smirking with a scoff as she closed the magazine, the nude figure of a woman dancing on a pole obviously shown on the front page, the title taped over with "BD Research Material" written over it in black marker as she moves it to the side.*

**"Welcome to the Vid Shop, where we have the latest and greatest in adult films and smut, looking for anything particular today, ma'am?"** *She droned with a teasing expression on her face, before she snorted.* **"Just fuckin with yah, sup Pags."**


[5/16/2023 6:13 PM] Paige
**"Was on the block and I figged I'd slide on in."** She leaned in a bit, **"Got any new shit in?"**


[5/16/2023 6:19 PM] Cat Bayes
**"Depends, you looking for the good shit?"** *Her knowing smirk widened as she leaned in as well.*


[5/16/2023 6:25 PM] Paige
She leaned away briefly, checking her surroundings quickly with the swing of her head before moving back in. **"You know me, I am always looking for the good shit. This softcore stuff just doesn't cut it."**


[5/16/2023 6:29 PM] Cat Bayes
**"I feel yah Pags, good shit's in the usual spot."** *Cat took out a plastic sign that had "BRB (Don't steal shit, I'll know!)" written on it, before leaving the counter and making her way over to the door in the back, beckoning for Paige to follow.*


[5/16/2023 7:33 PM] Paige
She would pump her fist twice with a sway of her head before following Cat!


[5/16/2023 7:40 PM] Cat Bayes
*Cat unlocked the door and opened it, heading down the stairs to a dark cellar that was retrofitted to hell and back. The girl loved her neon lights apparently, as they were strewn up across the edges of the ceiling around the room, some flashing orange, some flashing blue, and even some flashing pink. In the center, surrounded by a bunch of low hanging fiber cables was a large chair with a few ports screwed into the back of it. To the side of the room was another entryway with opaque plastic strips blocking view of the room...But Paige came here enough to know that's where Cat did her 'real' work.*

**"Alright Bookworm."** *A nickname Cat came up with for the pink-haired girl, a play on her name.* **"What'chu in for today?"**


[5/16/2023 7:51 PM] Paige
Paige followed Cat the stairwell, hopping off the fourth to last step and slowing her forward momentum down with wider strides. **"Heh, Something that would get me killed by each generation of my ancestors."**

[5/16/2023 7:53 PM] Paige
**"I'm certain you got your hands on something that would have even corpos  shittin' themselves. I like uncovering their little secrets from time to time."**


[5/16/2023 7:59 PM] Cat Bayes
**"Fucken preeeeeem."** *She pointed her thumb over at the chair.* **"You know the drill, plant'cha ass down and I'll get you set up."**

*She started to hum as she removed the cord from her wrist jack, plugging it into one of the servers as her blue eyes shifted to an orange hue, text flashing by as quickly as they appear as she browsed through her database.* **"Uuhhh...We gotta corpo meetup gone wrong, my guy says this one's pretty gruesome, dude gets shot three times before he's capped in the head."**

*She hummed as she continued her search.* **Nah, nothing juicy theeere...Oh, this one's black market type shit, Pags, you into that?"**


[5/16/2023 8:02 PM] Paige
She would run and slide as she slipped past the chair before jumping back into it. **"Black market? Seems a bit more up my alley."**


[5/16/2023 8:08 PM] Cat Bayes
*Click click, Bzztt...Ding! Cat's wrist jack ejected from the wall with a satisfying clack and swiftly returned to her port, snapping back into place as she walked over to the chair, plugging in some of the cables.*

**"Coo, coo...Alright, one of those bigwig tech companies had a big project they were working on; your usual 'put a dude in a big metal suit and make him immortal' beat, which you can already guess how it goes. Suuuper duper classified...Until, y'know, they fuckin leaked it to the dark net."**


[5/16/2023 8:13 PM] Paige
**"Haha, startin' to wonder how you got ya hands on this fuckin' virtus."** She settled in, preparing herself for the experience of a lifetime!

**"Heh, can't be outting my man like that."** *She said with a shrug, taking the headset off the back of the chair and strapping it to Paige's head.*

**"Want me to tell you to relax and give you my hand to hold, these can be pretty tough to watch y'know.~"** *She teased her friend.*

**"I ain't no gonk, Cat. Besides you would be obligated resuscitate me if I flatline so that's something to look forward too~"**


[5/16/2023 8:23 PM] Cat Bayes
**"Better not go flatlining on me! You're one of the regular regs I like!"** *She chuckled, typing a few commands before hitting the enter key.* **"Seriously though, you know the drill. I'll be here till you snap back to reality or you uh...start dying or something."** *She hung on that word for a few seconds, before smiling and waving.*

**"Haaaave fun in there!"** *The headset kicked to life and flashed a bunch of flickering lights into Paige's eyes, interfacing with her brain!*


[5/16/2023 8:24 PM] Paige
With a grin on her face, her vision began going black. The brain dance was now ready to begin!


[5/16/2023 8:36 PM] Brain-Dance
*The virtual scene flashed to life, Paige's eyes had to take a few seconds to adjust to the bright lights that were shining down on her, a few seconds later, the feelings of her limbs registered for her...It would've been pretty disorienting if she wasn't used to this already!*

*After a moment or two, she realized that she was strapped up to some sort of machine, tightly secured to the point where she couldn't even move her head even if she tried.*

[5/16/2023 8:37 PM] Cat Bayes
**"Oooh, some real BDSM kink right there, think any of those stiffs are into that off the clock?"** *Cat's voice echoed in her head!*


[5/16/2023 8:42 PM] Brain-Dance
*She appeared to be playing the role of a male, roughly in his late 40's...With his body type, he was definitely a military guy...and with the lack of feeling in his legs, most definitely a veteran.*

*The scientists were saying something to the guy, but it was hard to tell what they were saying with his adrenaline running so high, ears ringing and anticipation levels rising...Shit, they had CCR logos on their coats.*


[5/16/2023 8:48 PM] Paige
**"Yeah‚ÄîFuck, they messed this guy up."**


[5/16/2023 8:49 PM] Cat Bayes
**"Shhiiiiit, I didn't see that part, is that fucking CCR?"**


[5/16/2023 8:52 PM] Paige
**"CCR and Biotek from the looks of it."**


[5/16/2023 8:55 PM] Brain-Dance
*Finally, one of the mil-stiffs spoke up. His words were lost in the haze of adrenaline as well, but our guy simply nodded and the sound of machinery whirring to life pierced through the veil of dopamine, clearly making him anxious.*

*Large robotic arms dropped from the ceiling, each of them sporting some nasty looking drills that were pointed right at him in various parts across his body...and they were already spinning.*


[5/16/2023 9:07 PM] Brain-Dance
*The drills were slowly approaching the man, his breathing becoming increasingly rapid with every second...before one of the scientists spoke up, and the drills snapped forward and were stabbed into the guy.*

*To say it was painful would be an understatement, two were definitely in either side of his head, there were some going into his ribs and down near his waist, which he couldn't feel as much thankfully. There were needles pushed into his arm as well, injecting some sort of drug into his system.*

[5/16/2023 9:18 PM] Paige
Paige's actual body tensed up violently. Gritting her teeth as she was experiencing the sensations. Lets just say, she was not having a great time!


[5/16/2023 9:26 PM] Brain-Dance
*After a little while, the drills finally made sense, they were attaching an Exo-Skeleton to him! The feeling of his brain melding with the new suit was extremely uncomfortable, and yet it seemed to start ceasing the pain dramatically!*

*...After a few moments however, something began to go wrong...there was a loud beeping noise that echoed throughout the lab as some of the scientists began to panic a bit, our boy's vision turning red as a god-forsaken rage filled his mind. With raw strength alone, he tore free from the shackles with a deafening roar and leapt from the stand, throwing a metal shelf across the lab into one of the scientists!*

*He hears the sound of gunfire, and a dull pain in his body...but that doesn't stop him, he continues wreaking havoc across the lab for another two minutes or three until one of them is finally able to put a bullet in his brain, the BD suddenly cutting off.*


[5/16/2023 9:33 PM] Paige
**"FUCK!"** She'd shout, perhaps trying to process all these emotions, sensory information and the immediate situation that is transpiring. She was there.


[5/16/2023 9:38 PM] Cat Bayes
**"Holy shit, Pags, you good?"** *Through a slurry of flashing lights and neon colors, Paige had to take a moment to adjust her brain to reality, the room fizzling in and out like a buffering video before it finally...somewhat settled down.*

*Cat was still at her computer, ready with what looked like a bottle of muscle relaxant.*


[5/16/2023 9:54 PM] Paige
Paige frequently blinked, trying to reorientate herself with reality. Her nerves still firing off as if she was still experiencing a much more diluted version of what transpired. Her breathing slowly edging away from hyperventilation. **"I've...I've been in some crazy brain dances.... But that.. that feeling was leagues beyond what I was ready for."**


[5/16/2023 10:01 PM] Cat Bayes
*Cat was already on the move, taking the headset off of her head and inspecting her eyes.* **"Hey, hey, I'm right here, take these."** *She gave her a couple pills, looks like the usual stuff she gives her whenever one of her customers needs to calm down from a particularly...vibrant BD*


[5/16/2023 11:52 PM] Paige
She opened her eyes and would take the pill, downing them like they were bit sized candies. From there, she would sit up. **"That was... nuts."**


[5/17/2023 12:11 AM] Cat Bayes
**"Yeah, told you this one was black market shit, not your usual hardcore BD."** *She leaned back on the desk, placing the headset down.*

**"So, what'cha think?"**


[5/17/2023 12:16 AM] Paige
**"It's fucking rad!"** She looked over towards Cat with that crazed smile that she typically has when she has bad ideas.


[5/17/2023 12:16 AM] Paige
**"I honestly felt like I was being torn a fuck a part for a moment there. Have you tried it?"**


[5/17/2023 12:19 AM] Cat Bayes
**"Hah! Not yet, I need to have my brains intact to run the shop, 'member?"** *She lifted a cigarette up to her mouth and lit it, taking a huff before blowing it out upwards, holding the cigarette pack out to Paige as an offer as she continued to talk.* **"Was planning on watching it over the weekend, when the store's closed."**


[5/17/2023 12:23 AM] Paige
**"I can run it for a bit if you're down."** She would say sarcastically.


[5/17/2023 12:37 AM] Cat Bayes
**"Hah! Sure sure."** *She rolled her eyes as she waved off her sarcastic friend.* **"Wanna put in an application while you're at it?"**


[5/17/2023 12:46 AM] Paige
**"Tempting, hanging out with you all day everyday sounds like a dream come true... But, I got some big responsibilities I need to hash out ya know?"**


[5/17/2023 12:47 AM] Paige
**"Some...obligations I need take care of before I go off doing my own thing."**


[5/17/2023 12:48 AM] Cat Bayes
*Cat nodded.* **"Understandable, life shit comes first...Wanna smoke?"** *She's still holding out the cigarette box.*


[5/17/2023 12:54 AM] Paige
She looked at the cigarette box before flicking it open and taking one out **"Sure."**


[5/17/2023 12:57 AM] Cat Bayes
*Cat took a huff of her stick and tilted her head back, blowing out a cloud of smoke.* **"I'd totally be scared of lung cancer if cybernetics weren't a thing."**

*Hoisting herself on the desk, a thing she commonly did, she gave Paige another look.* **"Y'know, I never thought about it till now, but what do you do when you're not jackin in and jackin off to BD's at my place?"**


[5/17/2023 1:02 AM] Paige
**". . ."** She thought about it for a moment. Weighting the possibilities, the risks of letting Cat know. This was the first time Cat has seen Paige really think before speaking.


[5/17/2023 1:04 AM] Paige
She took a long drag from the cigarette before exasperating through her nose. The smoke dispersing as quickly as it rolled out. **"Can I be honest with you, Cat?"**


[5/17/2023 1:05 AM] Cat Bayes
**"I like a bit of honesty from time to time, yeah."**


[5/17/2023 1:07 AM] Paige
**"A better question would be can you keep a honest answer secret?"**


[5/17/2023 1:07 AM] Paige
Finally, she looked towards Cat. Steeling her resolve.


[5/17/2023 1:08 AM] Cat Bayes
**"Pags, have you seen the shit I do down here?"** *She sat up, clearly intrigued by what Paige had to say...she's never usually this serious.* **"What's the big secret?"**


[5/17/2023 1:10 AM] Paige
**"I work with Mathias, Mathias Wildbourne of Horizon Grey."**


[5/17/2023 1:11 AM] Cat Bayes
**"..."** *Cat took another long drag of her cigarette, calmly...before she choked on it, coughing.* **"Fuckough--cough!"**


[5/17/2023 1:12 AM] Cat Bayes
**"Ma-fucking-thias Wildbourne?!"** *She hissed through clenched teeth, still coughing.*


[5/17/2023 1:13 AM] Paige
**"Not so loud! I much rather be caught with the sick gore porn shit than with you saying his name so loudly!"**


[5/17/2023 1:15 AM] Cat Bayes
**"Fuck...sound-proofed walls man..." ** *She had to lean on the desk, recomposing herself.* **"Hoooh...okay, I was expecting you to be in some criminal type beat, but *Horizon Grey*? Pags, you're a living fucken legend."**


[5/17/2023 1:20 AM] Paige
**"I can Hardly pass as one"** She stood up. This being the first time she opened up about it since the collapse. Might as well go on in.
**"I saw the ice bath, Cat."**


[5/17/2023 1:22 AM] Cat Bayes
**"..."** *This is the first time Cat didn't have a witty comeback right away, scoffing as she looked to the side.* **"...Hot water's hard to come by, and maybe I like my water cold?"**


[5/17/2023 1:24 AM] Paige
**"You're a netrunner, explains how you get the BDs... You have blanks BDs lying around and when you score on corporate networks housing these BDs you ripp'em and burn'em. Maybe even selling them to the highest bidder. I've been in this game since I was a teenager, Cat."**


[5/17/2023 1:31 AM] Cat Bayes
**"Fuck, fuck alright."** *She put her hands up!* **"You got me Paige, yeah, I don't have a *guy*, I get all this shit myself and even make a few Micro's off of them."** *She finally admitted, rubbing the back of her head.*

**"It's how I stay afloat, I don't make enough from this shop, man, and even then...who's gonna buy from a no-name like me?"**


[5/17/2023 1:35 AM] Paige
She held out her hands out disarmingly. **"It's OK, I don't fault you for doing what you had to do."**


[5/17/2023 1:36 AM] Paige
**"We both know each other's secrets. There is no reason for anyone of us to weaponize what we know. We are friends."**


[5/17/2023 1:38 AM] Cat Bayes
*She nodded.* **"Yeah...Yeah, you're right."** 

*She hoisted herself back on the ledge of the desk with a heavy sigh.* **"Fuck, sorry about that Pags, didn't mean to freak on you like that."**


[5/17/2023 1:39 AM] Paige
**"Same.."** Her stance relaxed, nodding in approval of the outcome.


[5/17/2023 1:39 AM] Paige
**"How long have you been netrunning?"**


[5/17/2023 1:42 AM] Cat Bayes
**"Ooooh..."** *She looked up, thinking about it.* **"It's been a while since I started...at first it was just quick-hacking some phones, a bit of datamining on the side...then I guess I kinda went down the rabbit hole, got myself a shabby set-up, but it works at least."**

*She pointed to the plastic strips that block the view of the room that even Paige wasn't ever allowed into, with the excuse that it was 'her room'."* **"Wanna check it?"**


[5/17/2023 1:44 AM] Paige
**"If you don't mind."** To lighten the mood she would go on to say, **"Would be rad to see what kind of set-up you're working with. Been a while since I've seen one in person."**


[5/17/2023 2:23 AM] Cat Bayes
*The newly discovered netrunner chuckled.* **"Yeah, prepare to have your mind blown."** 

*Walking in, the room was definitely...rundown, leaking pipes lined the ceiling that lead to an ice cooler, right next to the bath she probably got off of some home renovation website. In the corner was a computer where she did her 'dry hacking'.*

**"...Uh...Ta-daaaa.~"**

**"Not baad."** She said coolly, looking around the room. **"The first tub I've seen was done in dumpster."**


[5/17/2023 2:35 AM] Cat Bayes
**"Hardy har har, point is that it works."** *The asian girl rolled her eyes, folding her arms.* **"You should be feeling totes honored right now, first person I've ever let into this room."**


[5/17/2023 2:38 AM] Paige
**"When's the last time you've met one of the few surviving members of Horizon Grey?"** She retorted.


[5/17/2023 2:39 AM] Cat Bayes
*Blink blink.* **"Biiiiiitch."** *She droned out teasingly.*


[5/17/2023 2:41 AM] Paige
She'd laugh, **"Have to admit, this is prem. It works like you said."**


[5/17/2023 2:48 AM] Cat Bayes
**"Yuuuup, just don't mind the loose clothing all over the floor."** *She kicked a pair of underwear to the side.* **"As you can imagine I uh...haven't really needed to clean up in here for a bit."**


[5/17/2023 2:49 AM] Paige
**"Should see me and Mathias's place. It is not any prettier."**


[5/17/2023 2:54 AM] Paige
Her gaze left Cat, now focusing on the room.**"Speaking of Mathias and well... Horizon Grey. I think we could really benefit from having something like you on the team. There is no easy way to say it, but we cannot rebuild the legendary HG without a netrunner and trust me sis, Mathias is no netrunner."**

**"This not a easy thing for me to do. And I am sure that it is no in your best interest to just abandon what you got going on here so I'll leave the topic on this note.... Give it some thought, if you're interested I can tidy up our apartment and give you the run down on what we are about."**

**"..."** *Once again, Cat had to really think about the implications of what her friend was asking here...running for one of the most legendary crews in all of Vespera would be like a dream-come true for any netrunner worth their credit...but...* **"...Yeah, I don't know Pags...I respect the hell outta you guys and the shit you guys pulled back in the day..."**

*She looked over at the door.* **"But...even if this place doesn't rake in all that much money, it's still *my* thing, y'know? That's hard to have for someone like me living in this city."**


[5/17/2023 3:01 AM] Cat Bayes
**"...But...Even if I can't commit to it now, keep that offer open, alright? Shit, I'll even make today's session free."** *She gave her friend a wink.*


[5/17/2023 3:02 AM] Paige
**Ahaha, you know I am now obligated to leave a good review. So cruel of you."**


[5/17/2023 3:04 AM] Paige
**"It's a deal, I should get going now. Can't be too careful you know?"**


[5/17/2023 3:05 AM] Cat Bayes
**"Right right, go save the world legend."** *She walked over to the entry way.* **"Man, work's gonna be so boring now..."**


[5/17/2023 3:06 AM] Paige
She began making her way towards the exit **"Don't worry, I'll try to stop back in. Next week for sure! Oh, and one more thing... Keep that BD you showed me in layaway for me."**


[5/17/2023 3:06 AM] Cat Bayes
**"Fuck yeah, still need to plug myself into it too!"**


[5/17/2023 3:16 AM] Narration
This was the last time Cat had seen Paige before disaster struck home...

Two weeks later...


[5/17/2023 3:18 AM] Narration
Paige never did return to the shop within a week, but what she did do was provide Cat with an address with no context. Though, it would not be difficult to know what that address led to.


[5/17/2023 3:21 AM] Cat Bayes
*Cat was at her usual spot in the store, tapping her finger on the counter as she stared down at the address...It was a bit worrying that she hadn't seen Paige walking into the store with her usual swagger like she usually does for a while now, especially after what she told her when they'd last met...*

*Had something happened to her friend?...Nah, she must be busy is all...Hell, she was considering taking an ice bath and diving into the network to track her down...but that'd be totally stalking, and even she had her limits.*


[5/17/2023 3:28 AM] Narration
The usual crowded vid store went without a hitch. Business continued and micros kept flowing. Despite the usual hustle and bustle of the video store, there was an odd calmness in the atmosphere. Customers browsed the shelves, chatted with each other.

Through the gaps between the posters on the windows, several headlights illuminated the inside of the building more than the existing neon lights did. All of which coming to a stop. It was a rare sight to see this many vehicles parked out front at once. The headlights shining through the windows added to the surreal atmosphere.


[5/17/2023 3:30 AM] Cat Bayes
*Cat wasn't bothered by this at first, wincing at which ever asshole decided to leave their brights on when they pulled up to her store. Probably some group of dumbass group of friends looking to get a hit off their favorite hot anime chick or something. Whatever, business as usual.*


[5/17/2023 3:32 AM] Narration
Several doors opened and closed... Too many doors... The patrons at the door began looking out to see what the hell was going on. Then the looks filtered from the outside in. Now, the store hushed.


[5/17/2023 3:38 AM] Cat Bayes
*The girl looked up from her magazine at the store, it wasn't usual for the customers to go quiet like this...what, did the CCR just roll up into her establishment or something? She looked over at what she originally thought was a group of jackass kids...Oh shit.*

The customers at the door were now moving out of the way.


[5/17/2023 3:40 AM] Benedict
Stepping into the establishment, his gaze remained fixated forward. The man's eyes narrowed as if he was viewing something __unfathomably revolting__

His eyes slowly swept the store, his head moving along.


[5/17/2023 3:43 AM] Cat Bayes
*Fuck, fuck fuck - all the fucks - hell no, this dude had trouble written all over his premium mug. Cat stood up straight and placed her hands on the counter.*

**"Hey man, can I like...help you?"**


[5/17/2023 3:43 AM] Benedict
**"Five..."**


[5/17/2023 3:44 AM] Narration
Five? What was he-


[5/17/2023 3:44 AM] Benedict
**"Four..."**


[5/17/2023 3:44 AM] Cat Bayes
*She was tensing up now, the fuck was he doing?*


[5/17/2023 3:44 AM] Narration
Oh nope, not today. The people inside the store knew better than to stick around until he got down to **0**


[5/17/2023 3:44 AM] Benedict
**"Three..."**


[5/17/2023 3:45 AM] Narration
People began piling up on the door, trying their damn hardest to escape. Though when everyone crowds a exit, it makes exiting that much slower.


[5/17/2023 3:46 AM] Cat Bayes
**"Dude, what the hell is your problem?!"** *Cat was watching in bafflement as her customers fled the store, she couldn't afford a hit to her reputation like this!*

**"Everyone, try to remain calm! Guy's just being a jackass, form a line!"**


[5/17/2023 3:48 AM] Benedict
**"Two... and one."** Wait he cheated.


[5/17/2023 3:48 AM] Narration
Those who did not make it out in time were forced back into the store by his security detail. The men he brought with him armed to the teeth with pulse rifles and heavy plated armor.


[5/17/2023 3:49 AM] Cat Bayes
**"What the...fuck?"** *She'd just notice the armed security force outside of the store, stepping out from behind the counter to confront the man.* **"Yo, *dickhead*, can I fucking help you?"**


[5/17/2023 3:49 AM] Benedict
**"Take them to that wall over there."** He'd direct his men. Who obeyed without missing a beat. Dragging and beating the remaining customers without remorse.


[5/17/2023 3:50 AM] Benedict
He would then take it upon himself to go to the door. Kick the wedge from holding the door propped open. When the doors came to a close, he would lock it and flipping the sign. **CLOSED** 

**"We are closed for professional development."**


[5/17/2023 3:52 AM] Cat Bayes
**"Hey! You can't just close MY shop! Who the fuck even are you?!"** *She looked over towards the armed men who were roughly dragging the customers to the wall.* **"Ay, asslickers! They've got nothing to do with this!"**


[5/17/2023 3:52 AM] Benedict
Rolling his shoulders and fixing his synthetic tie. He would walk past the counter without looking at Cat. **"They are involved now."**


[5/17/2023 3:54 AM] Cat Bayes
**"Fuzakeru na!"** *If he had any sort of translator, that was japanse for "Fuck off!"* **"Who the hell are you?!"**


[5/17/2023 3:55 AM] Benedict
**"Your first ever nightmare. Cat Bayes."**


[5/17/2023 3:56 AM] Benedict
He finally turned to look her in the eyes. **"You know why I am here."**


[5/17/2023 3:56 AM] Cat Bayes
**"What, to jack off to some brain porn?"**


[5/17/2023 3:57 AM] Benedict
**"You mean stolen, right?"** He'd interject.


[5/17/2023 3:57 AM] Cat Bayes
**"...The hell are you on about?"**


[5/17/2023 3:58 AM] Benedict
**"You're a crafty one I must admit, for a complete amateur running such a pathetic excuse of a business."**


[5/17/2023 4:00 AM] Benedict
He would turn on his heel going over to the shelves, pulling out the sleeves a bit to see their titles and cover art before putting them back **"It has been a while since I had to come out to Haven Heights... Usually its our true competitors that force me to come out."**


[5/17/2023 4:00 AM] Cat Bayes
**"Yeah will, I'm not even a competitor dude, just trying to get by."** *She folded her arms.* **"You gotta pay for that y'know, wanna share it with your buddies over there?"**

**"Heh.. They certainly do get paid, and you cut into their profits by stealing my company's merchandise."** He then rose his head, looking over the shelf in the aisle he was in. Looking at his men. **"Isn't that right?"**


[5/17/2023 4:04 AM] Narration
Two of the men would begin approaching Cat, breaking off from the other six.


[5/17/2023 4:05 AM] Cat Bayes
*Cat began to back up, looking at the two approaching men nervously.* **"Dude, I don't know what the fuck you're on about-"**


[5/17/2023 4:05 AM] Narration
The two men would latch their cybernetic arms onto her shoulders and arms. Pulling her roughly along with the others lined up against the wall.


[5/17/2023 4:06 AM] Cat Bayes
**"Fuck! Ow, hey! Lemme go!"** *Cat was kicking and yelling at the two the whole way there until she was put up against the wall!*


[5/17/2023 4:07 AM] Benedict
He walked around the aisle, now entering the aisle in which they were lined up on and on their knees. Brandishing a pistol with a white and gold trim.


[5/17/2023 4:09 AM] Benedict
He would pull back on the slide slowly, letting the sounds deafen the room.


[5/17/2023 4:09 AM] Narration
The customers who were forced against the wall started crying, pleading for their lives and trying to stand. Each of these actions resulted in some form of beating.


[5/17/2023 4:09 AM] Cat Bayes
**"Hey...Hey, hey!"** *She thrashed about, yelling at the fucker pointing a gun at the innocent people.* **"Stop! Stop it, they're innocent! They didn't do anything!"**


[5/17/2023 4:10 AM] Narration
She was immediately struck with the stock of one of the guards SMG's


[5/17/2023 4:10 AM] Cat Bayes
**"AGH!"** *She fell to the floor and held her face with a teeth clenching groan.*


[5/17/2023 4:10 AM] Benedict
**"If there is one thing you filthy peons lack, its __dicipline.__"**


[5/17/2023 4:11 AM] Benedict
**"Where is the footage?"** He'd point the gun at the first person in line.


[5/17/2023 4:13 AM] Cat Bayes
*She was torn, could she just out herself like that for someone she didn't even know? Seconds felt like years in that moment to her...Ah fuck it, she didn't have a choice.*

**"DOOR!...Door...in the back...where all the...good shit is..."**


[5/17/2023 4:14 AM] Benedict
**"..."** His eyebrows rose, looking quite impressed with her sudden willingness to give up the info. One look at the nearest man to him and to the door the armed man went.


[5/17/2023 4:14 AM] Benedict
**"Obedience will get you far."**


[5/17/2023 4:15 AM] Benedict
**"I'm glad you finally realized."**


[5/17/2023 4:15 AM] Cat Bayes
**"...Please, let them go...they had nothing to do with it."** *She was whimpering now, pleading to him.*


[5/17/2023 4:16 AM] Benedict
**"Look at me."** He'd demand from her.


[5/17/2023 4:16 AM] Cat Bayes
**"..."** *She complied, giving him a mean glare.*


[5/17/2023 4:17 AM] Benedict
**"Remember, that I am your first nightmare... And I most certainly will be your only."** He'd pull the trigger, killing the first person immediately. Blood splattering all over the place. The impact of the bullet even sending blood splatters onto Cat.


[5/17/2023 4:19 AM] Cat Bayes
**"Ah-"** *Cat was in shock, the sound of the gunfire still ringing loudly in her ears as the person's body crumpled to the floor in slow motion...she knew that guy...he often came in and chatted with her...*


[5/17/2023 4:19 AM] Benedict
He'd take another step forward, aiming his pistol and taking out the second person. Then, the third. **"When will I run out of ammunition? Can you make a educated guess?"**


[5/17/2023 4:20 AM] Cat Bayes
**"STOP, STOP IT! PLEASE!"**


[5/17/2023 4:20 AM] Cat Bayes
**"FUCKING- GODDAMNED, SON OF A BITCH, GO TO FUCKING HELL!"**

With the last person dead, it all came down to Cat.


[5/17/2023 4:23 AM] Cat Bayes
*She wasn't even looking at him, she was just staring at the row of bodies in shock, disbelief, and finally rage.*


[5/17/2023 4:24 AM] Benedict
He would step in front of her. Looking down at her with a hint of disgust as he holster his pistol back into his jacket. **"The answer is 12...Twelve rounds."**


[5/17/2023 4:25 AM] Cat Bayes
**"I knew those guys...some of them were good people...one of them just recently bought a game here for his son's birthday..."** *She muttered under her breath.* **"You...FUCKING...*MONSTER*!"**


[5/17/2023 4:26 AM] Benedict
**"Hmph."** He'd smirk, pulling up his slacks as he squatted down towards her.


[5/17/2023 4:26 AM] Narration
His men pulling Cat into place so that she could not retaliate against him.


[5/17/2023 4:26 AM] Cat Bayes
*Oh boy did she try retaliate, she was thrashing about like a wild animal trying to get at this fucker's throat!*


[5/17/2023 4:27 AM] Benedict
He would tilt his head a little. Reaching into one of Cat's pockets and taking out the cigarette box. Pushing out his bottom lip as if he was a curious child. **"Thank you."**


[5/17/2023 4:29 AM] Benedict
He would flick it open, taking one out and lighting it. Slowly taking a drag from it and intentionally blowing it into her face. **"I'm starting like you. You could be a decent whore in Neon Kyrie.... But, rehabilitation would be... costly... Too bad you probably don't have the funds to afford it."**


[5/17/2023 4:29 AM] Benedict
**"Too bad."** He'd toss the cigarette into the shelves as it was still lit.


[5/17/2023 4:30 AM] Narration
The man that went down into the basement came back up with a box. **"Found it."** He would state.


[5/17/2023 4:31 AM] Cat Bayes
**"RRAAGGGHHH!"** *Cat was trying her damn best to lunge at him despite the restraints, kicking her legs against the ground as the sparks ignited the flammable shelves!*

[5/17/2023 4:46 AM] Cat Bayes

[5/25/2023 7:28 PM] Narration
It was late when Ghostgaze made it to the lot which Cat's vid shop once stood. The building was completely burnt out. Three of the walls that made up the structure had collapsed. What was left within the walls was black ash and burnt metal scrap that trashed the place.


[5/25/2023 7:32 PM] Ghostgaze
*Ghostgaze stood before the charred remnants of Cat's video shop, his gaze fixed upon the ruins that lay before him. The once vibrant establishment now stood as a testament to destruction and devastation. The sight of the collapsed walls and the lingering scent of burnt debris filled the air, serving as a stark reminder of the violence that had unfolded within these walls.*

*Silent and unmoving, __Ghostgaze took in the scene,__ his mind racing to piece together the puzzle of what had transpired here. The burnt-out remnants offered no clear answers, only fragmented remains of what was once a place filled with memories.*


[5/25/2023 7:46 PM] Narration
He'd step through the building, beneath some of the rubble. Ghost would kick free a half burnt bone. Whoever was here died with the fire.


[5/25/2023 7:57 PM] Ghostgaze
*Ghostgaze's eyes briefly glanced down at the half-burnt bone, an object that held a haunting reminder of the tragedy that had unfolded within these walls. But his expression remained__ stoic,__ his emotions concealed behind the mask that covered his face. He understood the gravity of the situation, the loss of life that had occurred, but he also knew that dwelling on it wouldn't provide him with the answers he sought.*

*As he moved through the wreckage, his mind was consumed by questions. __What caused the fire? Was it a targeted act, or an accident? And most importantly, did the owner manage to survive the inferno?__*

*With each step Ghostgaze took, he scanned the surroundings, searching for any additional clues that could shed light on the circumstances surrounding the fire. He inspected the burnt-out remnants, hoping to find something that would lead him closer to the truth. The crackling of the embers beneath his boots echoed through the silence, a stark reminder of the destruction that had taken place.*


[5/25/2023 8:01 PM] Narration
The floor was covered, forcing Ghost to step over large pipes. Then, one step caused his foot the fall into the floor? If he recovers before falling into this black hole was up to his ability to react!!!!


[5/25/2023 8:05 PM] Ghostgaze
*Ghostgaze's foot gave way as he stepped over the debris-covered floor, momentarily losing his footing. __However,__ his years of training and sharp reflexes kicked in, allowing him to swiftly react and regain his balance. With a quick recovery, he managed to steady himself and avoid falling into the dark void below.*

*His expression remained stoic and composed, showing no signs of fear or panic. Ghostgaze's eyes narrowed as he surveyed the weakened floor and the hole that had opened up. He __analysed__ the situation, his mind working to determine the cause and assess any potential dangers that lay ahead.*

*With a calm and focused demeanour, Ghostgaze adjusted his approach, treading more cautiously across the unstable ground. He was not one to let a mere misstep deter him from his mission. Instead, it only served to heighten his __awareness__ and __sharpen__ his resolve.*


[5/25/2023 8:22 PM] Narration
The hole widened, a concrete staircase revealed itself. Leading into a basement of some kind.


[5/25/2023 8:25 PM] Ghostgaze
*Ghostgaze's gaze shifted towards the newly revealed concrete staircase leading into the depths of the basement. The widening hole presented an opportunity for further exploration, and he knew that delving deeper might uncover valuable clues or answers to the mysteries surrounding the burnt-out video shop.*

*With cautious steps, Ghostgaze descended the staircase, his senses on high alert...*


[5/25/2023 8:42 PM] Narration
The stairs reeked of burnt aromas from metals, rubbers and plastics. Ash hung in the air as if it was in time dilation. The fire spread down in the basement but seemed to have died out quickly as the lack of oxygen became greater as the building collapsed. Only portions of the basement remained intact. The BD room where Cat had most of her "Goods" was  stripped clean of its contents. The second room however held more a story.. All it would take is for Ghost to __enter__.

*As Ghostgaze's gaze scanned the remaining portions of the basement, his attention was drawn to __two distinct rooms.__ The first, the BD room, stood empty, stripped of its illicit contents. It was clear that someone had been here before, perhaps in search of something valuable or incriminating.*

*However, it was the second room that piqued Ghost's curiosity. This room held a story yet to be discovered, a hidden narrative waiting to be unravelled. With a mixture of anticipation and caution, Ghostgaze approached the entrance of the room, ready to explore the secrets it held.*


[5/25/2023 8:51 PM] Narration
The room contained a bathtub, several thick diameter cables sprawled around the floor. On the far end of the room was a terminal that lacked power due to the fire.


[5/25/2023 9:01 PM] Ghostgaze
*With his senses heightened, Ghostgaze cautiously advanced into the room, his __handgun__ held firmly in his grip. He meticulously scanned the surroundings, his eyes darting from one corner to another, ever vigilant for any sign of lingering danger. The room seemed devoid of any immediate threats, but he knew better than to let his guard down.*

*His attention was drawn to the bathtub, an inconspicuous fixture that held the potential for hidden details. Ghostgaze's mind raced with possibilities, contemplating the significance of this seemingly ordinary object. Could it hold clues about Cat's nature of work as a netrunner? If that were the case, it could shed light on the whole situation, making Paige an even more formidable figure than he had initially perceived.*

*The sprawl of thick cables strewn across the floor hinted at a complex network of connections, further fuelling Ghostgaze's suspicions. His mind churned with questions, each possibility leading to a web of intricate scenarios.*

*However, his focus momentarily shifted to the terminal at the far end of the room. The lack of power due to the fire rendered it inert, preventing him from accessing any potential information it might hold.*

*Maintaining his vigilance, Ghostgaze continued to survey the room, his finger resting gently on the trigger of his handgun. The discovery of the bathtub and the presence of the tangled cables only deepened the intrigue, solidifying his resolve to uncover the truth that lay hidden within the charred remains of the video shop's basement.*


[5/25/2023 9:06 PM] Narration
Ghost would step beside something that glint against the lens of his mask. Something thin and long.


[5/25/2023 9:11 PM] Ghostgaze
*Intrigued by the glint caught in the lens of his mask, Ghostgaze directed his attention towards the source. He cautiously approached the object, his movements deliberate and calculated. As he neared, what did he see?*


[5/25/2023 9:12 PM] Narration
A hair strand. Pink with the root blonde.


[5/25/2023 9:17 PM] Ghostgaze
*Ghostgaze's attention was drawn to a delicate hair strand lying nearby, contrasting in colour with the metallic strip he had just discovered. The pink hue with the blonde root intrigued him, as it hinted at a potential connection to someone, perhaps the owner of the video shop?*

*With a bandaged hand, Ghostgaze carefully picked up the hair strand, ensuring not to disturb or damage it. His in-built cyberdeck, integrated within his mask, allowed him to perform various analyses and scans. Activating the appropriate functions, he aimed his gaze at the hair strand, activating the scanning capabilities of his cyberdeck.*

*A stream of data began to flow across Ghostgaze's visual display as the cyberdeck processed the hair strand's composition and structure. He observed the intricate details, searching for any traces of unique identifiers or anomalies that could provide valuable insights. *


[5/25/2023 9:21 PM] Narration
As he was doing such a red shockwave would burst from his eyes. A reconstruction of what transpired in the room began to emerge. The reconstruction would place Paige in the room. She was speaking with someone, but without their biometrics, they were nothing but a guesstimate; a silhouette.

[5/25/2023 9:27 PM] Ghostgaze
*Ghostgaze's cybernetic eyes emitted a crimson shockwave, a surge of energy that rippled through the room. As the shockwave expanded, a remarkable phenomenon occurred. The air itself seemed to come alive, forming ethereal wisps that coalesced into a vivid reconstruction of past events.*

*Within the reconstructed scene, Ghostgaze witnessed Paige's presence in the room. Her figure materialized, and she appeared to be engaged in conversation with __another individual.__ However, the lack of clear biometric data obscured the features of the other person, rendering them as nothing more than a silhouette. Ghostgaze could only make an educated guess about their identity, relying on their approximate size, shape, and movement patterns. It is very likely that this silhouette was the video shop owner, Cat.*

*Despite the visual ambiguity, the reconstruction allowed Ghostgaze to observe the dynamics of the interaction. He attentively studied the gestures, body language, and overall demeanour of Paige and the unrevealed figure. Every nuance and subtlety was magnified, offering valuable insights into the nature of their conversation and the context surrounding their encounter.*

*The reconstruction served as a tangible glimpse into the past, shedding light on a pivotal moment within the confines of the room. As Ghostgaze absorbed the information provided by the red shockwave, he pondered the significance of this encounter and its potential implications for his investigation.*

*With the reconstructed scene etched into his memory, Ghostgaze carefully stored the newfound knowledge, ready to analyse it further and incorporate it into his ongoing pursuit of the truth.*

[5/25/2023 9:45 PM] Ghostgaze
*As the reconstructed conversation played out, Ghostgaze absorbed the exchange between Paige and the unidentified silhouette, capturing __every word__ and __subtle interaction.__ The dialogue revealed a certain familiarity and camaraderie between the two individuals, suggesting a __deep-rooted connection.__*

*Paige's nonchalant demeanour and witty banter indicated her comfort in the presence of the silhouette, whom Ghostgaze__ now identified as Cat,__ the owner of the video shop. Their conversation ranged from playful teasing to more serious matters. Paige acknowledged the significance of being allowed into Cat's secret room, emphasizing her status as one of the few surviving members of Horizon Grey, a fact that elicited a humorous response from Cat.*

*The discussion then shifted to the topic of Horizon Grey and the need for a skilled netrunner within the group. Paige expressed her belief that Cat's abilities would greatly __benefit the reformation of Horizon Grey,__ highlighting the shortcomings of their current leader, Mathias, __who is now confirmed to be alive.__ The proposition seemed to intrigue Cat, prompting her to consider the offer and the potential implications it would have for her own personal endeavours.*

*However, Cat voiced her reservations about leaving behind her video shop, a place she considered her own in the vast expanse of Vespera. She expressed the value of having something that belonged solely to her in a city where such autonomy was scarce. Despite her hesitation, Cat requested that the offer remain open, indicating her respect for Paige and the legendary status of Horizon Grey.*

**. . .**


[5/25/2023 9:45 PM] Ghostgaze
*Their conversation concluded with light-hearted banter and promises to reconnect in the future. Cat playfully mentioned leaving a good review, and they exchanged farewells, with Paige emphasizing the need for caution in her endeavours to "save the world."*

*The reconstructed conversation provided Ghostgaze with __valuable insight__ into the dynamics between Paige and Cat, as well as Paige's involvement with Horizon Grey. The offer extended to Cat and her hesitation to leave behind her video shop suggested a complex decision-making process and a deep attachment to her current lifestyle.*

*Ghostgaze carefully considered the implications of this newfound information, recognizing the potential impact it could have on his investigation and the overall situation surrounding Paige.*

*With the reconstructed scene etched in his mind, Ghostgaze kept his cyberdeck's scanning feature running. He stood in the room, contemplating the significance of this encounter and the role it played in his pursuit of the truth. The presence of Cat, a netrunner, within the context of Paige's story only deepened the mystery and potential dangers surrounding her.*

*Ghostgaze's professional demeanour remained intact as he absorbed the information, his mind now buzzing with further questions and potential leads.*


[5/25/2023 9:47 PM] Narration
His scanning feature pinged off the door frame. Paige had touched it on the way out!


[5/25/2023 9:47 PM] Narration
Paige's reconstruction then came back to him. Turning the corner out of his sight. He best follow it!


[5/25/2023 9:50 PM] Ghostgaze
*As Ghostgaze's scanning feature pinged off the door frame, indicating Paige's touch, his attention was immediately drawn to the potential significance of this discovery. It hinted at a possible trail to follow and further insights into Paige's whereabouts. Determined to uncover more, he swiftly made his way to the door frame, positioning himself to scan it for any residual information.*

*With precision, Ghostgaze scanned once again, focusing on the area where Paige had made contact. The technology within his mask worked diligently, analysing the surface and attempting to extract any relevant data or traces left behind.*

*As the scan progressed, __a new reconstruction materialized__ in Ghostgaze's mind. He saw Paige turning the corner just out of his sight, heading towards a destination yet unknown. The sense of urgency and purpose in her movements indicated that she had something important to attend to or someone to meet.*

*The reconstruction solidified Ghostgaze's decision to __pursue__ this lead. With the image of Paige fresh in his mind and the desire to uncover the truth burning within him, he resolved to follow in her footsteps. The door frame had provided a valuable clue, and he intended to capitalize on it.*


[5/25/2023 9:52 PM] Narration
She would begin going up the stairs. Ending when she reached the top.


[5/25/2023 10:01 PM] Ghostgaze
*Ghostgaze observed the reconstruction of Paige's movements as she ascended the stairs, her figure growing fainter with each step until she reached the top. The reconstruction provided a glimpse into her trajectory and indicated that she had reached her destination on the upper floor.*

*Ghostgaze's reaction remained __composed__ and __focused.__ He understood the significance of this moment and recognized that he was closing in on Paige's current whereabouts. With each new piece of information and every step closer to the truth, his determination __only grew stronger.__*

*Without wasting a moment, Ghostgaze followed in Paige's footsteps, ascending the stairs with purpose. The burnt aromas still lingered in the air, a constant reminder of the destructive events that had unfolded in the video shop. Yet, Ghostgaze pressed on, undeterred by the remnants of chaos around him.*

*As he reached the top of the stairs, his gaze scanned the area, taking in his surroundings. He remained alert, prepared for any unexpected encounters or clues that could __further guide his pursuit.__ The silence of the abandoned floor echoed in his ears, adding an air of suspense to the atmosphere.*


[5/25/2023 10:03 PM] Narration
The heat and flames must have destroyed any remains of her biometrics. As nothing was being seen to match Paige.


[5/25/2023 10:11 PM] Ghostgaze
*As Ghostgaze carefully searched the upper floor, it became apparent that the intense heat and flames from the fire had taken their toll. The destructive force had left behind little evidence of Paige's presence or any viable biometric data to match against. The remnants of the video shop offered __no__ immediate clues or confirmations of her whereabouts.*

*Undeterred by the lack of tangible evidence, Ghostgaze relied on his instincts and training. He understood that sometimes the absence of information can be as telling as its presence. While the reconstruction had provided glimpses of Paige's recent interactions, it didn't provide a clear path to follow.*

*With each passing moment, Ghostgaze considered the possibilities. Had Paige managed to escape the fire unscathed? Or was she purposely hiding her presence, leaving no trace of her biometrics behind? The uncertainty only fuelled his determination to continue the search.*

*In the face of adversity, Ghostgaze maintained his professional demeanour, his mask betraying no hint of frustration or disappointment. He understood that the pursuit of truth and uncovering elusive targets required __patience, perseverance, and a willingness__ to adapt to unexpected circumstances.*

*As he stood in the charred remnants of the video shop, Ghostgaze contemplated his next move. Despite the lack of immediate leads, he remained resolute in his mission to find Paige and unravel the mysteries surrounding her. He would need to explore other avenues, gather more information, and rely on his skills and contacts to continue the chase...*

`Or perhaps go and meet Digit?`

He was not far from his hideout. If he needed to, he could return and prepare for the showdown. Or perhaps move to beat anyone else there. The Choice was his.


[5/26/2023 11:58 PM] Ghostgaze
*With the newfound information updating Paige's location, Ghostgaze's stoic demeanor flickered slightly with a glimmer of anticipation. He took note of the precise coordinates: __Littleton, Tyrek Block 1100.__ It was a lead he couldn't ignore.*

*Recognising the importance of preparation, Ghostgaze made his way back to his hideout with purpose. The journey was swift, his mind focused on the task ahead.*
