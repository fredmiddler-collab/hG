[1/24/2025 7:18 PM] Narration
The night air was cool in Jansville, a light fog caressed the ground. Scattering lights from the emissive street lights... A light fog caressed the ground, making any motorist slow down the streets. Cole, known as Ghost, would emerge from the tunnel, courteous Hect. The location he was given was not far off now. We was down in a 'concrete valley' A shallow stream of water running along the lowest point which was the center of the valley.

Ghost was on elevated ground, though, if he was to go towards the center, he'd drop a meter or two into the 'shallow water'. To his right was a set of stairs that led up along the diagonal walls and up to what he could consider to be the street above him. The sounds of vehicles was an clear indicator of this.


[1/24/2025 7:25 PM] Ghost
*He opted to take the stairs, his primary focus being to close the distance to his destination. Kode had warned him, but it wasn’t enough to sway Ghost. If Kode’s claims held any weight, it only meant that someone like Freddie posed a greater risk if left unchecked. Even then, Kode had failed to provide sufficient details to explain what made this old man so dangerous, leaving Ghost __**unconvinced.**__*

*He was armed to the teeth: an assault rifle, dual handguns, two impact grenades, one smoke grenade, and, of course, the trusty ice pick. He wasn’t here to kill an old man; __he was here to honor the deal.__*


[1/24/2025 7:34 PM] Narration
**BUUUUUYUHMM!!"** A new aerial vehicle would do a flyby, parallel with the road Ghost was now coming to level with. It was armed with what would appeared to be four pods and six rockets; If he could track it for how __FAST__ it was moving. The Photon Falcon couldn't even come close to the speed of this aircraft... Certainly military, its collision lights blinked and flashed as it vanished into the distance... Then a second one followed up seconds after, then a third...

[1/24/2025 7:39 PM] Ghost
*Ghost's eyes strained to lock onto the fast-moving aircraft, but it was already too far, too quick for him to even register its details. However, his instincts told him everything he needed to know, it was something that could easily give him the same treatment as Paige and Mathias if he wasn’t careful.*

*He scanned his surroundings cautiously, every muscle tensed for any sign of danger. Once he felt it was safe to proceed, he moved, continuing his path toward the marked location.*


[1/24/2025 7:52 PM] Narration
Ghost's path of travel went without much resistence. Though there were instances where he would encounter these people that had gear that would make the CCR Special Forces look like larpers. Thankfully, they were not entirely cautious. Enabling Ghost to reach the front of the apartment complex; His destination right before him...


[1/24/2025 7:57 PM] Ghost
*Ghost knew he couldn’t just walk into the apartment building, there could be cameras watching his every move. He surveyed his surroundings, scanning for another way in. His eyes shifted to the side of the building; maybe he could find a way to scale the walls, bypassing the main entrance entirely. The higher floors would be harder to access, but with his experience, he knew how to make it work if the risk was worth it.*


[1/24/2025 8:00 PM] Narration
There was an alley he could shoot down into. However, it was locked down with a 12 foot chain-link fence. He could attempt to scale it with the risk of someone seeing him in the process. The fence had a gate, but it was chained shut. He could attempt to crack it with force or shoot it? He had options.


[1/24/2025 8:07 PM] Ghost
*With his cybernetic ability activated, Ghost’s form blurred as he became virtually invisible to the naked eye. He approached the chain-link fence cautiously, scanning for any possible watchers. Once confident the area was clear, he approached the fence, his movements fluid and silent. He gripped the top edge, using his upper body strength to pull himself up...*


[1/24/2025 8:07 PM] Narration
The sound of a vehicle was rapidly approaching... He could make it the rest of the way if he hustled.


[1/24/2025 8:09 PM] Ghost
*With precise footing on the fence's vertical bars, he swiftly scaled it, his motions smooth as he evaded any noise. Once he reached the top, he paused, scanning the surrounding area one last time before dropping silently to the other side, landing on the balls of his feet.*


[1/24/2025 8:14 PM] Narration
The headlights of the oncoming car bled through the fence. His form in the darkness. Leaving him __undetected__. He may proceed. The side of the building presented two convex  wall pieces that would allow him to scale. Extending his limbs outwards to crab walk upwards if he so chose too.


[1/24/2025 8:23 PM] Ghost
*Ghost pressed against the convex walls, positioning his hands and feet for maximum leverage. As he began his crab walk, his legs locked in place, one bent and hooked against the edge of the building, providing him with a stable grip. With his feet planted firmly on the opposite wall, his body moved fluidly with each step, using his core strength to maintain balance. His arms reached above, fingers gripping tightly as he shifted his weight upward, locking his legs in place with every move. Slowly, he made his way to the roof, fully aware that one wrong move could** expose him.***


[1/24/2025 8:30 PM] Narration
Ghost reached the roof, on one corner of the building (Furthest from him) was an access door which would lead him down into the apartment's top floor. However, it seemed like it had access control, meaning he would need a badge to get in... Or use other methods to get in.


[1/24/2025 8:35 PM] Ghost
*Ghost reached the access door and, seeing the badge reader, __**quickly drew his ice pick.**__ He slid it into the lock mechanism, twisting with practiced motion...*


[1/24/2025 8:38 PM] Narration
The door's lock protested, but the pins inside began to snap. Allowing the handle to move more and more the further he continued to twist and drive the edge into the socket.


[1/24/2025 8:40 PM] Ghost
*Ghost continued working the ice pick into the lock, twisting and applying pressure. Each turn and push made the resistance lessen, the internal mechanism protesting less with every attempt.*


[1/24/2025 8:43 PM] Narration
POP! The door opened, the handle now was dangling in its socket.


[1/24/2025 8:51 PM] Ghost
*Ghost moved ahead, carefully opening the door as he unholstered one of his sidearms. Using his stealth to his advantage, he navigated his way downstairs. **Room 51**... his destination.*


[1/24/2025 8:54 PM] Narration
The top floor was the 50 series. Perfect... He was at one end of the hall, closest door read **59**.


[1/24/2025 8:58 PM] Ghost
*He took note of the door and continued moving down the hall. His handgun trained, he proceeded slowly and silently. Kode's warning hadn't completely fallen on deaf ears, he kept it in mind, using it to stay vigilant around the old man.*

***How close was he now?***

[1/24/2025 9:18 PM] Ghost
*Room **51**. This was it. Ghost pressed his back against the wall, carefully assessing his situation. There was **only one** way in, and stealth was no longer an option. His body began to glitch **in** and **out**, much like it did when he was chasing down Dylan.*

-# *Taking a deep breath, he cleared his mind. Fear and hesitation were luxuries he couldn't afford right now. Clear the mind... flush out any intrusive thoughts, urges, or temptations. Focus, Cole. Focus.*

*Now, he assessed the door. What was he dealing with here? Was it breachable?*

[1/24/2025 9:21 PM] Narration
The door from the outside seemed ordinary, like the ones he passed. However, they were all made of solid metal alloy. It would take him a while to breach forcefully. Even then, it would certainly alert any tenants within if he took the aggressive approach.


[1/24/2025 9:37 PM] Cole Mercer
*The pressure built inside his skull, each heartbeat pulsing in his temples like an angry drum. The door before him, just a simple obstruction, seemed to grow in his mind—**big,** **massive**, **impossible.** With every passing second, his thoughts splintered. The voices—their murmurs turned into shrill demands, __echoing__ through the hollow of his mind.*

[1/24/2025 9:37 PM] Cole Mercer
*A sharp, slicing headache shot through him, blurring the edges of his vision. It was like his own body was betraying him, drowning in the static of his mind, as though his thoughts were unraveling. His hand, slick with sweat, instinctively pressed against his mask, but it did nothing to silence the voice within him.*

*The voices became **thick**, **sticky**, coating every thought. The need for action. The need for blood. It was so **LOUD**, so all-consuming.*


[1/24/2025 9:37 PM] Ghost
# ***DO IT. DO IT NOW. DO IT BEFORE YOU THINK.***


[1/24/2025 9:37 PM] Cole Mercer
*A cold sweat ran down his spine. He had to fight it. **Focus**. **Think.** But the more he fought, the more the voices stretched, **sliding** into every crack of his mind, bending his clarity. The door wasn’t just a door anymore. It was a **barrier**, a challenge to his control.*

-# *Be calm. Be calm. Control. CONTROL. Calm... calm...*


[1/24/2025 9:37 PM] Ghost
*He slowly began to calm down, his breathing heavy. Pressing his back against the doorframe once again, he needed a moment to look away. He then surveyed his left and right, ensuring the hallway was still empty...*


[1/24/2025 9:43 PM] Narration
It was quiet... the sound of the air ventaltion system humming to life as if it was absent in his moment of turbulance... Not a single soul was in the hall.


[1/24/2025 9:49 PM] Ghost
*Step by step, his focus returned. He knew he had to approach this with a clear mind. Kode wouldn’t go out of his way to simply scare him, his warning had weight. Still, the lack of information on how to handle this man weighed heavily on him. He decided to play it safe. Moving to the other side of the door, he used his left hand to knock **twice**. The sound echoed in the quiet hallway. His right hand remained firmly gripping his handgun, the **Midnight Edge.***


[1/24/2025 9:54 PM] Narration
Silence dominated the space, the sound of the knocking could be heard for eternity as the reverberations hit the alloy surface... A minute gone by without a single reply, the sound of motion on the otherside. Nothing.

Just before he would rapp his fist against the door a second time, a muffled but grizzled voice **"Who the hell is knocking on my door at midnight for crying out loud?!"** Huh, whomever it was on the otherside wasn't too excited to have a late night visitor.


[1/24/2025 9:58 PM] Ghost
*The glitching effects momentarily stopped, but it was only a matter of time before they resurfaced. He knocked once more, hoping to bait the person on the other side out. All he needed was for the door to be **unlocked**.*


[1/24/2025 10:06 PM] Narration
**"Damn kids and their antics."**
-# **"Last time I'll answer the fuckin' door at midnight. They can eat rat shit for all I care."**
...

Did he just, walk away?


[1/24/2025 10:15 PM] Ghost
*It seemed that whoever was behind the door was playing hard to get. __Knocking was out of the question now.__ Repeatedly kicking the door would risk waking everyone on the floor and alerting the authorities. He needed to act **fast.***

*He briefly holstered his handgun and reached for his pouch, pulling out __one__ impact grenade and __one__ smoke grenade.* 

*He moved further down the hall to create a safe distance.*

[1/24/2025 10:19 PM] Ghost
*Like a seasoned pitcher, he prepared his throw. Every motion was precise, every detail calculated, **one mistake** could put him in a world of trouble. Not that the situation wasn't already dangerous. He reeled his arm back, then released the impact grenade, sending it soaring toward the door!*


[1/24/2025 10:21 PM] Narration
**BOOM!** The door would twist and fragement, blowing an huge hole in the center of it. Large enough for a man to duck and squeeze in if need be.

**"SHIT!"** He could hear emitting underneath the deafening roar of the explosion.


[1/24/2025 10:24 PM] Ghost
*Ghost moved swiftly, pressing his back against the wall next to the hole. He pulled the pin on his smoke grenade and tossed it inside. Once the grenade was thrown, he drew his **dual handguns** and prepared to enter the room.*

[1/24/2025 10:26 PM] Narration
The smoke rolled for a bit, notifying Ghost that there was either a hallway or a open space. Then, the ignition of the greande began and shortly after, smoke began bellowing, seeping out into the hallway.


[1/24/2025 10:26 PM] Ghost
*He moved in, his handguns aimed. What did he see?*


[1/24/2025 10:29 PM] Narration
He was greeted with a living room to his immediate front and to the right. Dead ahead of him was a small hallway where the smoke bomb ended up. There were three doors in this hallway. On the left was the Kitchen and closer to the living room were bar stools, one of them knocked over. Whoever was at the door a moment ago must of knocked it over when the grenade went off.

[1/24/2025 10:32 PM] Ghost
*He carefully checked each room as he made his way to the knocked-over stool, moving slowly and methodically. His eyes darted from one corner to the next, ensuring there was no one hiding, waiting to ambush him. His form flickered in and out, a side effect of his malfunctioning cybernetic. He needed a new one—**soon**. The glitching was becoming harder to ignore.*


[1/24/2025 10:38 PM] Narration
It was one particular glitch that gave whoever was preparing against a good enough shot. A shot rang out, ricocheting off of objects in the apartment and striking Ghost at the top of his mask. It was on a shallow angle in which it hit him. But it was **dead center** It bounced off his head and took out the chandaliers above where he was (the stool). His mask still intact, so was his life.

The chandaliers came crashing down around Ghost. Glass shattering in hundreds of pieces as his back made contact with the low wall.


[1/24/2025 10:45 PM] Ghost
*Ghost’s glitching became a strange advantage as he remained partially invisible, just enough to stay unpredictable. He fought against the disorienting effect, focusing on the objective. Shots had been fired, and he had no choice but to retaliate. The sudden crash of the chandeliers didn't knock him out of his purpose. After hitting the low wall, he shook off the dizziness and moved with precision. He returned fire—**four shots from each handgun, eight total**—aiming at the source of the shot, then quickly darted into cover. Whatever he could find to shield himself was better than nothing, and he’d make it work.*

[1/24/2025 10:50 PM] Narration
Ghost returned fire, it was coming from the room beyond the living room. The otherside of the wall. Cole's bullets chewed through the room, but they were ineffective as bullets not of his own came back out.  These bullets had blue tracers arcs as they emerged. Each bullet did __NOT__ target Ghost directly, instead they relied on the presence of other objects within the room. Bouncing and encroaching on Ghost's last position. These bullets took CHUNKS out of the bar. Reducing Cole's cover to nearly nothing to conceal him.


[1/24/2025 10:52 PM] Narration
Silence.....


[1/24/2025 10:58 PM] Ghost
*The ricocheting bullets hummed through the air with pinpoint accuracy, each one a threat in its own right. One even grazed his face, and the sudden flash of memory hit him like a punch: Luke’s warning from earlier. Luke. Nasty Lonestar. Could this be Luke? Ghost couldn’t be sure, but there was no time to confirm. The only thing he knew for certain was that, if it was, he had **one shot** left.*

*But now was not the time for thinking, now was the **time to act.** He stayed __perfectly still__, not a muscle moved. His handguns were close to his chest, poised and ready for when the time was right. His cover was gone, but his cybernetic ability was still active. Ghost was visually gone. For now, that was his only advantage.*


[1/24/2025 10:59 PM] Narration
The smoke that was lingering in the air was begin to disappaite since the apartment's ventilation system was effectively clearing it. There was a sparking outlet nearby, casting a eerie shadow in the kitchen every so often...


[1/24/2025 11:00 PM] Narration
Seconds turned into minutes...


[1/24/2025 11:00 PM] Ghost
*Get a visual… get a visual. Remain perfectly still. Whoever was out there wouldn’t know that Ghost was lying on the floor. His eyes darted left and right, scanning for any movement or clue that could reveal the enemy’s position.*

Above the grounding outlet the sound of slow and methodical footsteps could be made.
-# crunch.... crunch... crunch...

Since he was behind what was left of the bar, he would have to wait until they were nearly on top of him.


[1/24/2025 11:02 PM] Ghost
*His breathing slowed, his senses sharpened.*


[1/24/2025 11:03 PM] Narration
**"Who the hell sent you?! You aren't no regular thug... Cyberfreak?"** The man demanded. He was __CLOSE__.


[1/24/2025 11:04 PM] Ghost
*Ghost did not respond. **Obviously,** he was waiting for a clear shot. His assault rifle was still slung on his back, but grabbing it would mean breaking his stillness. He needed a perfect visual...*


[1/24/2025 11:04 PM] Narration
**"I'll tell you now, asshole. You aren't going to like what is going to happen next..."** 
Crunch... Crunch... CRUNCH...


[1/24/2025 11:06 PM] Narration
He stopped moving, there was ruffling... Clothing?


[1/24/2025 11:08 PM] Ghost
*The right moment. Wait for the right moment. Do not mess this up, Ghost. Do not.*

*His fingers tightened around the grip, his trigger finger primed. He wasn’t messing around. Ghost **needed** to pull this off without fail.*

*That's when his ears picked up the sound of close footsteps, the faint rustle of movement...*


[1/24/2025 11:08 PM] Narration
*click...click.*


[1/24/2025 11:10 PM] Narration
CRUNCH.... **CRUNCH** Then, a foot in a slipper came into view then a leg. Then a torso!


[1/24/2025 11:12 PM] Fred Dawson
The old man's face illuminated due to the failing electrical in the kitchen. But only for a brief moment. His eyes slowly scanning around the kitchen, unaware of where Ghost was.


[1/24/2025 11:13 PM] Fred Dawson
He had a interesting looking handgun in his possession. A smart weapon without a doubt.


[1/24/2025 11:16 PM] Ghost
*Ghost remained perfectly still. This wasn’t Luke, good. However, he still needed to confirm whether this was Freddie or not. For now, survival was his priority. Ghost calculated that if he remained motionless, his target might assume he had relocated, giving him a potential advantage.*


[1/24/2025 11:18 PM] Fred Dawson
**"Ergh... I hate Veilheisen tech."** He muttered to himself, moving past the counter in the center of the kitchen and rounding it. He could simply fire around until he finds him.. Unless he's low on ammo?


[1/24/2025 11:21 PM] Fred Dawson
He continued to round the counter until his full body was now visible to Ghost. He was about to come into physical contact with Ghost at this point!


[1/24/2025 11:25 PM] Ghost
*Ghost finally had a clear visual on his target. Without hesitation, he switched his Midnight Edge to **burst** fire mode and swiftly aimed both handguns at the man’s legs. He fired **four rounds** from **each** gun, the shots arcing upwards in a precise trajectory to target his **legs** and then his **torso**. Each movement was calculated...*


[1/24/2025 11:34 PM] Narration
Every shot was precise, yet each narrowly missed its mark. Ghost’s vision wavered, distorting the moment his crosshairs settled on the man’s figure. Just aiming at him was enough to make his head spin, a sickening churn clawing at his stomach. Waves of nausea hit instantly, accompanied by a deafening roar in his ears—far louder than anything he should have been hearing. What the hell was happening? This had to be some kind of cybernetic—a psychic emitter designed to disorient and incapacitate anyone targeting its user.


[1/24/2025 11:34 PM] Fred Dawson
He flinched instinctively at the shots, but they missed entirely, leaving him unharmed. In that split second, he seized the opportunity, raising his own weapon with precision. Without hesitation, he fired a single round, the bullet finding its mark in Ghost’s neck.

The needle like projectile wedged itself precisely between the mask and his neck protector, piercing the surface of his skin and delivering a sharp, jarring shock to his system. The surge of energy overwhelmed him, causing his muscles to seize uncontrollably. Within moments, his body gave out, teetering on the edge of unconsciousness before succumbing entirely to the debilitating impact. The last thing he was able to see was Fred approach his body...

Out...Like... A... Light.

[1/24/2025 11:39 PM] Narration
Cole woke up instinctively, tied up to a pillar, seated in what appeared to be in a basement of some kind. It was lit, a chair was the only furniture that was presence and a single door on the far side of the space.


[1/24/2025 11:43 PM] Cole Mercer
*Cole's eyes fluttered open, squinting against the dim light before briefly shutting again. He scanned his surroundings groggily, almost as if waking from a deep sleep. Attempting to move his arms, he quickly realized it was futile, he was securely bound. As he assessed his predicament, a question lingered in his mind...*

`"What knocked me out like this... again?"`

[1/24/2025 11:45 PM] Fred Dawson
**"Don't bother, if a single thread is severed, you will implode."** The older man's grumbling voice emitted from behind Cole. Then, a few steps later, Fred walk to his front, looking down at him. **"You heavy piece of shit."**


[1/24/2025 11:48 PM] Cole Mercer
*Cole let out a low grunt, unfazed by the insult. He wasn’t one to break from words alone. However, something about Fred’s tone and demeanor told him the man wasn’t bluffing. Slowly, Cole lowered his gaze to the ground, assessing his situation in silence.*


[1/24/2025 11:49 PM] Fred Dawson
**"Who sent you?"** He'd demand bluntly.


[1/24/2025 11:51 PM] Cole Mercer
*Cole remained silent, as getting a word out of him was never an easy feat. However, it all depended on how far Fred was willing to go to force him to speak...*


[1/24/2025 11:57 PM] Fred Dawson
**"I don’t have time to waste on some ‘tough guy’ act. You’ve already ruined the little sleep I was supposed to get with your nonsense, and my daughter was supposed to be discharged today. But no—here I am, stuck dealing with you. So, unless you want this to get a whole lot worse for you, I suggest you stop wasting my time. Who are you working for?"**


[1/25/2025 12:01 AM] Cole Mercer
*Cole let out a low chuckle, a cold smirk tugging at the edge of his lips. That was the **second time** he'd done that, and it seemed to **amuse** him. The silence between them stretched for a moment, before he finally spoke, his voice flat.* **"The Metro has a few words for you."**


[1/25/2025 12:03 AM] Fred Dawson
**"Smartass."** He'd say flatly. Reaching into his leather jacket, he would withdraw a circuit board with leads on it. Then, begin to approach Cole.


[1/25/2025 12:05 AM] Fred Dawson
**"You're awake. That is all that matters."** He would take his expose his wrist, (the one with the board in hand) and pull a jack reel from it. Plugging it into the board. LED lights began flashing. He did all of this while still approaching Cole.

[1/25/2025 12:07 AM] Cole Mercer
*Cole had no idea what Fred was about to pull, but he seized the moment to toy with his words, testing how far he could push it.* **"Expected nothing less from a former Horizon Grey member,"** *he said, his tone dripping with icy detachment.*

[1/25/2025 12:09 AM] Fred Dawson
He would then kneel down beside Cole. Staring at the side of his head. **"How do you know about that organization? Even tunnel rats __shouldn't__ know about that."**


[1/25/2025 12:10 AM] Fred Dawson
**"You best explain in plain english, or I'll extract ever last data block from your skull and turn you into a vegetable."**


[1/25/2025 12:11 AM] Cole Mercer
**"This is just the tip of the iceberg. You really want to risk it?"** *Cole's voice was stripped of any emotion. His eyes weren't lying.*


[1/25/2025 12:13 AM] Fred Dawson
**"I'm a dead man walking, I do not care."**


[1/25/2025 12:16 AM] Cole Mercer
**"Then you know about my bounty. Puts us both on the same ship."** *Cole glanced up at the ceiling for a moment, then turned his gaze back to Fred.* **"The past finally caught up to you?"**


[1/25/2025 12:18 AM] Fred Dawson
**"Start with the Metro. Was it that two-timing loan shark, Hector that put you onto my trail?"** He was really not interesting in entertaining Cole.


[1/25/2025 12:20 AM] Cole Mercer
*Cole nodded, a smirk tugging at the corner of his lips.* **"He asked me to remind you about the 4% you owe him,"** *Cole said flatly.*


[1/25/2025 12:21 AM] Fred Dawson
**"Of course. He probably also expected you to be killed so that he could collect your bounty himself and split it with his partners. Step #1, don't trust anyone from the Metro. You failed that step."**


[1/25/2025 12:22 AM] Fred Dawson
**"Horizon Grey, you know of my affiliation. How?"**


[1/25/2025 12:25 AM] Cole Mercer
**"Under mutual circumstances, I joined that organisation about two weeks ago. Can't say it feels like home."**


[1/25/2025 12:25 AM] Fred Dawson
His brow furrowed. **"Who's leading it?"**


[1/25/2025 12:28 AM] Cole Mercer
*Cole tilted his head slightly, his gaze unwavering.* **"Before I give you the information you're looking for, what exactly do you plan to do with __me__ afterward?"**


[1/25/2025 12:30 AM] Fred Dawson
**"You're in it for yourself. That's a good mentality. Frankly, I am going to knock you out and drop you back  off where you came from to your friends in the Metro."**


[1/25/2025 12:31 AM] Fred Dawson
**"Vesperian Legion are running the show now. Killing you will only expedite my own death."**


[1/25/2025 12:32 AM] Fred Dawson
**"Rendering your stupid and brainless doesn't count as killing so I still have that option."**


[1/25/2025 12:32 AM] Fred Dawson
He would shift the board in his hand.


[1/25/2025 12:35 AM] Cole Mercer
**"Not sure I like your answers. The Metro isn’t a place for the walking dead. Besides, do you really want to throw an opportunity like this away? What exactly are you trying to achieve on your own?"** *What was Cole implying...?*


[1/25/2025 12:36 AM] Fred Dawson
**"Last chance."**


[1/25/2025 12:37 AM] Cole Mercer
**"Mathias."** *Cole had reached the limit in his little game. No more toying around.*


[1/25/2025 12:39 AM] Fred Dawson
**"Is Paige with you?"**


[1/25/2025 12:40 AM] Cole Mercer
*Cole nodded, his expression unreadable.*


[1/25/2025 12:41 AM] Fred Dawson
**"I see."** He would pocket the board and stand back up.


[1/25/2025 12:42 AM] Cole Mercer
*Cole sighed, leaning his head back against the pillar, a strange calmness settling over him.*


[1/25/2025 6:57 PM] Fred Dawson
**"I find it difficult to fathom that you are Hector's errand boy. You ought to have a ulterior motive."** Fred remarked as he walked towards the door. By the door was the heap of Cole's gear. He would take his mask within his hands and run his thumbs cross the surface.


[1/25/2025 7:00 PM] Cole Mercer
*Cole let out a low chuckle. Fred had a point, it was hard to believe. He exhaled slowly before speaking, his tone steady and detached.* **"I’m a former bounty hunter. Circumstances have pushed me into taking whatever jobs I can to keep my resources stocked."**


[1/25/2025 7:13 PM] Fred Dawson
**"You'd best stick with your people, then."** Fred tossed the mask into the heap and pulled up the chair in front of Cole. **"The CCR are being disbanded and my sources tell me that District 9 is on the brink of collaspe."** He would let out a groan as he lowered himself down in the chair. **"Soon, streets are going to be getting carpet bombed and the indiscriminate killings will be even common place in Fairview."**


[1/25/2025 7:20 PM] Cole Mercer
**"I don’t stick with people. I work alone,"** *Cole said, his tone cold.* **"If what you’re saying is true, I’ll __relocate.__"**

*His eyes fixed on Fred, unblinking.* **"Why are you still breathing?"**


[1/25/2025 7:22 PM] Fred Dawson
He would look down towards Cole. **"Because, I got people to look after... And I don't take unnecessary risks."**


[1/25/2025 7:25 PM] Fred Dawson
**"Question for you now, since I am in a better mood now... If I was to dump your unconcious body anywhere. Where would it be?"**


[1/25/2025 7:30 PM] Cole Mercer
*Cole looked up, his expression thoughtful as if the question required serious consideration. He didn’t seem bothered by it at all, instead, he was lost in thought. Finally, he replied,* **“Kapea. An abandoned factory.”**


[1/25/2025 7:37 PM] Fred Dawson
**"I believe I could arrange that."** He would lean off to one side and reach around his back. Withdrawing his handgun from last night. Fumbling with his pants pocket, Fred pulled out a bullet and kept it in his hand as he ejected the magazine and slid the round in.


[1/25/2025 7:41 PM] Cole Mercer
**"I have a request,"** *he stated bluntly. Cole remained unfazed by his situation, though the notion of returning empty-handed clearly didn't sit well with him.* **"I didn’t come here to kill you. What I needed was a __new mask__, but with Hector’s setup, I’ve effectively lost a key supplier."**


[1/25/2025 7:51 PM] Fred Dawson
**"I don't do favors for those who decides to forcefully enter my home at the apex of midnight."** He'd slid the magazine into the handgun and rack it. **"But, I would do a favor for someone who leads me to Paige."** He would then point the gun towards him. **"You already had a tracker on you so I reverse engineered it. Hang around the girl for a while, and I'll see to it I return the favor."**
 
Bang, similarly to what occured prior. His body would seize and the world began flickering in and out rapidly until once more, darkness.

[2/18/2025 6:41 PM] Narration
Kaedues emerged into a concrete ravine, with a shallow stream of water running along the center of the area. Kaedues stood on elevated ground. In front of him was shallow water, flowing westward (Right to Left). To his right and down a ways was set of stairs that led diagonally up the walls to the street above.

(This was a extremely similar route that Ghost took.)


[2/18/2025 7:32 PM] Kaedues Staub
*Kaedues takes a look at the surroundings he finds when he exits the tunnel. He examines this area very, very carefully and makes sure to absorb the visage of this scene like a picture in his head.*
*(If I am really in Jansville, then I'm that much closer to the offices Gavyn pointed out to me.) Kaedues thinks to himself. He looks up at the wall behind him and at the sky and begins to walk toward the stairway.*

*(It should go without saying that if I try to move through the checkpoint back to Kapea, I'll be flagged. I should return through the tunnel...) Kaedues' grey eyes look behind himself at the tunnel he came from. His crimson eyebrows furrow together as he considers the best way to move forward.*

*(Then again, if I can't find my way here from the checkpoint.. I'll have come here for nothing.)*
*Kaedues climbs the stairs and looks around again.*


[2/18/2025 7:57 PM] Narration
The streets of Jansville are busy, but in a way that doesn't scream chaos. Kaedues emerged just in time where a father and his son were walking along the sidewalk that joins with the staircase. He gave the family duo a slight startle, but nothing more as they continued on their way.

The street was a four laner, two lanes designated to go in one way and filled with traveling motorists. They way people walked, dressed, and talked here was different but not much so as there were lingering associatations to life across the wall.

 The Vesperian Legionaries were intertwined with the traffic both on the streets and sidewalks in larger numbers than in Haven Heights. An apartment building nearby was taped off for what appeared to be for an investigation of sorts. Luckily for Kaedues, his destination was in the opposite direction, a block away.


[2/18/2025 8:32 PM] Kaedues Staub
*By accessing his map of D9, Kaedues can get a general overhead view of Jansville. He searches for the Kapea checkpoint using this function of his neural deck and considers a route to that place from where he is. He'd have to avoid the building with all the Legionaries.. actually, just those borged-out guys in general definitely look like they'd flag him immediately if they saw him.*

*For now, Kaedues opts to walk down the road. He turns his head to look at the investigation ongoing, and finds his mind wandering more than he is used to.*
*(The messages on that tape.. they're clearly there to warn people about the goings-on...) This idea is pretty foreign to Kaedues. A lawman in the Stacks wouldn't bother telling apartment tenants they are being investigated before kicking their door in.*
*His gaze pivots forward. (That.. makes a lot of sense. I would do the same thing, in their position.)*

*Kaedues' index finger and thumb come together, rubbing against one another in circles. A sinking feeling emerges in his stomach when he thinks about what he just thought.*


[2/18/2025 8:36 PM] Narration
On the top floor of the building complex, there was an obvious hole in the wall, neighboring windows were blown out; An explosion no doubt. The Vesperian Legionaries were too absorbed in their investigation to notice Kaedues.


[2/18/2025 8:39 PM] Kaedues Staub
*He continues to travel forward, then, until he might find the checkpoint. Even just a look at it would be good enough for Kaedues.*


[2/18/2025 8:46 PM] Narration
Kaedues would be able to see the opposite end of the checkpoint in all of its glory, from a hundred yards or so beyond the intersection he was coming up across. Kaedues could make out the large frame of that mech-like vehicle still on the otherside, now moving about between the lanes of traffic. Still a very contested checkpoint indeed!


[2/18/2025 8:48 PM] Kaedues Staub
*The redhead nods to himself and opts then to move back toward where he was coming from. He references the geo Gavyn sent him earlier and finds that the offices he needs to make an appearance at are not far away at all. With that knowledge, he'd set out to go find them according to his neural deck's navigator.*


[2/20/2025 8:11 PM] Narration
The offices in which Kaedues was happening upon was a sizeable building. Nowhere nearly as intimidating as the BioTek offices, but impressionable nontheless. A building comproised of a healthy blend of steel and glass, the sun reflected off of the face of the building, giving it an almost exalted shine. 

At the ground floor, Kaedues could see inside the lobby. There were a few people loitering, speaking with one another or talking on their neutal decks, drinking, and even filling out paperwork. There was an automated set of double-doors that seperates the world from the inside of the building... All that was left was for Kaedues to go inside...


[2/20/2025 8:25 PM] Kaedues Staub
*Kaedues looks up at the building. He finds that focus he's looking for, the commitment to completing this errand, but it feels strained somehow.*
*The redhead takes note of all the people inside the lobby; his eyes give a hearty glance to each of them before he enters the building through its automated double doors.*


[2/20/2025 8:38 PM] Narration
The door chimed and he was graced with a climate controlled space. The receptionist at the front desk was front and center, awaiting to accept Kaedues' inquries. She had medium-length ginger hair and appeared to be in her early thirties, her hands were clasped in one another in front of her. **"Welcome, how may I assist you today, sir?"**


[2/20/2025 8:41 PM] Kaedues Staub
*Kaedues' eyes scan her face as he approaches. He doesn't hesitate to explain himself.*
**"I'm here to apply for a job. I was recommended one at a warehouse in Kapea."** *he says.*


[2/20/2025 8:51 PM] Narration
The receptionist's light smile would waiver slightly before beaming brighter. **"Well, congratualtions on the recommendation! Would you please forward any recommendation messages that you might have received from the interested party?"**


[2/20/2025 9:00 PM] Kaedues Staub
**"I don't have anything like that. If you want a message, I can contact the person who recommended me. Does that work?"** *Kaedues asks plainly.*


[2/20/2025 9:11 PM] Narration
**"Ummn.."** The receptionist shifted subtly.  **"That will not be necessary. Who recommended you? Their name?"**


[2/20/2025 9:13 PM] Kaedues Staub
**"Gavyn,"** *He replies.* **"Never caught the man's last name."**


[2/20/2025 9:15 PM] Narration
**"Ah! Gavyn."** Her face lit up with familiarity **"He did mention you would be coming by eventually. You must be Kaedues, I am pleased to have finally met you."** She was extremely friendly, or at least externally. **"Yes, I have an application prepped for you."** She sat back down behind the desk and began looking for the application.


[2/20/2025 9:20 PM] Kaedues Staub
*Other than a confirming nod, Kaedues hardly moves an inch in any direction. His eyes stare intrusively at her, not focusing anywhere in particular as she searches.*


[2/20/2025 9:29 PM] Narration
Every so often, the receptionist can feel Kaedues' borderline souless stare boring into the side of her head as she searched for his application. Her eyes flicked to his a few of the times as the discomfort of his gaze began to truly settle in. The woman could not find the application any sooner for she precured a already pre-loaded datapad with the application for Kaedues to fill out being on the screen. She nearly dropped the datapad, trying to hurry and give it to him. 

**"Oops, sorry!— The application is on this datapad. Please, __find a seat somewhere__ and fill it out to the best of your ability."** She offered.


[2/20/2025 9:34 PM] Kaedues Staub
**"I will. Thanks."** *Kaedues takes the datapad and moves to a nearby couch. He sits down and takes a look at the application...*

*if there's nothing out of the ordinary, of course he'd just input the required data.*


[2/20/2025 9:37 PM] Narration
The datafields did not appear out of place; Just your typical employment question were present.


[2/20/2025 9:39 PM] Kaedues Staub
*Then, with the application complete Kaedues would just return the pad to the front desk's receptionist.*


[2/20/2025 9:44 PM] Narration
The receptionist scooted closer towards the center of the desk and received the datapad from the applicant. **"Thank you, if everything checks out, which I am sure it will. You'll be able to start  as early the upcoming Monday. We'll contact you about your start date or if any issues with your applications are found."**


[2/20/2025 9:46 PM] Kaedues Staub
**"Okay. Thank you for your time."** *Kaedues responds before stepping away from the front desk and turning to leave. He'd leave the building entirely and make headway toward the maintenance tunnel if not stopped on his way out.*

[4/24/2025 10:18 PM] Narration
Cat was the first to emerge in Jansville, stepping out from the shadows of the surrounding landscape. The concrete valley stretched out around her, its high walls reflecting the late afternoon sun and casting long shadows that danced across the ground. A narrow stream of murky water meandered through the lowest point of the valley, glistening as it caught the light.


[4/26/2025 7:44 PM] Cat Bayes
*As she climbed out of the vent with great haste, the panicked netrunner made sure to check their surroundings before falling down to her knees, panting heavily. Her ears were still ringing from the sound of gunfire, mind racing with questions and lungs burning from the desperate chase.* **"They just...fuck- They just opened fire on the crowd, no fucking hesitation..."** *She muttered, turning back to find Cole.*


[4/26/2025 7:49 PM] Cole Mercer
*He climbed out of the vent right after her, landing on his feet with a heavy thud that echoed softly in the narrow space. He rose slowly, cracking his neck with deliberate calm before stepping forward. He didn’t respond to Cat’s words, there was no need, or perhaps his ears were ringing too. Anyone decked out like that was already beyond reasoning, straight-up madness.*


[4/26/2025 7:54 PM] Cat Bayes
*She was having a hard time blocking out the blurred images of the chaos that had just unfolded behind them, her hands - still gripping the worn hilt of the revolver - were shaking beyond her control.* **"Fuck, fuck..."** *Deep breaths, Cat. You need to calm down, don't focus on the noise. Wiping the cold sweat from her brow, she stashed the gun in her back pocket and tried to rise to her feet, looking over towards Cole.*

**"You...you good?"** *She asked, after a quick gulp to fix the dryness in her mouth.*


[4/26/2025 7:57 PM] Cole Mercer
*Cole raised one hand slowly to cover his right ear, his calm expression darkening with a flicker of irritation. The sharp echoes of the gunfire weren’t just rattling the crowd, they were getting to him too. After a tense moment of silence, his voice cut through the lingering noise,* **“Let’s just move.”**


[4/26/2025 8:10 PM] Cat Bayes
*Yeah, that's about what she expected to hear. Giving him a quiet nod, Cat threw up her hood over her head and moved over to Cole's side, ready to move out. Her hand briefly traced over the tablet in her pocket, making sure it was still there...*


[4/26/2025 8:19 PM] Cat Bayes
*As the two made their way through Jansville, Cat looked over towards Cole for a brief moment, slowing to a halt.* **"Hey, Cole...Before we head over to Aurora's place, we need to make a quick stop."** *She said, holding the tablet still in her pocket.*


[4/26/2025 8:23 PM] Cole Mercer
*Cole came to a slow halt, his movements deliberate as he turned his head toward Cat. His grip tightened on the duffle bag at his side, the only sign of tension in his otherwise composed posture. His voice was cold and measured,* **"How critical is this detour?"**


[4/26/2025 8:30 PM] Cat Bayes
**"Critical enough."** *Cat responded, her tone determined and resolved to see this through.* **"It won't take long, we'll probably be there for a minute at most...but it needs to be done."**


[4/26/2025 8:33 PM] Cole Mercer
*Cole let out a low grunt, a subtle sign of reluctant approval.* **“Lead the way.”**


[4/26/2025 8:34 PM] Cat Bayes
*The netrunner nodded, a silent thank you that spoke louder than words. Making her way in front of him, she began walking into the neon lit alleyways of Jansville...*


[4/26/2025 8:45 PM] Narration
Cat and Cole climbed their way out of the concrete valley and up into the alleyway nearest to them. Jansville was similar to Littleton, the biggest difference is that Jansville actually has precinct services that *actual* did something.

There were a few souls that occupied the narrow walkway. Each of them hugged the wall nearest to them as they lived out their lives as citizens of District 9. The evening was cool, prompting two people experiencing homelessness to crowd near a fire. Another was injecting a syringe into his exposed calf, sighing in contentment as the substance did whatever it was doing to save the man's addiction.

The sound of emergency vehicles filled the air, bouncing off the tall walls of structures—only broken up by the ambient life in Jansville. The distant clouds were beginning to rumble, threatening the region with a barrage of thunderstorms. If Cat had referenced and geolocated the tablet data, Dylan provided an address to what appeared to be a site that holds both physical and digital PO boxes.

Underneath the geo-location was an message key. A secure way to anonymous mail to the owner of these boxes. The beauty of this is that it keeps the sender and the receiver secret from one another and from prying eyes.

*Well, that made things easier to track down at least. All they had to do was find their way to the P.O. Box so Cat could deposit the message, then continue on their merry way. That being said, she couldn't really hand this tablet off without taking a look at its contents first. So with a digital map open in her peripheral, she took a look at what the device contained...where was that message?*


[5/2/2025 5:15 PM] Narration
The message was an encrypted file but was opened in a widget that allowed for viewing its contents. Perhaps a measure that Dylan had preemptively thought Cat might do for security reasons.

The message closely resembled what one might anticipate from a hostage who felt compelled to withhold critical information. Dylan skillfully refrained from including any identifiable details, such as specific names or geographic locations, to protect herself and others. Instead, she expressed her deep concerns about the situation that Cat had informed her of, elaborated on the insights she had gained during her captivity, and reassured her loved ones that she was alive and receiving basic care.

There were no attachments included with the message.

The P.O. Box area was not far from their location, which was convenient since the duo would have to navigate on foot.

As they strolled down the narrow alley, a massive Vesperian transport truck rumbled past, its powerful engine echoing off the smooth walls. The truck’s exterior gleamed with a partially reflective alloy, catching and refracting the ambient light around it. Vibrant neon accents adorned the trim, pulsating softly in a small range of colors. The bed of the truck was securely enclosed, giving it's contents privacy, while bold letters reading "VP-GTV-33" stretched along its length.

*Satisfied that the message wouldn't compromise Horizon Grey, she stashed the tablet back in her pocket again before continuing along the alleyway. It's a good thing the P.O. Box was nearby, she had no desire to stay here any longer than she had to.*

*That being said, the presence of the Vesperian Legion in the area didn't do much to help with her nerves as she watched the neon lit, military grade truck drive right on past them. Maybe it was a transport for VL tech or more mind controlled soldiers, off to shoot up a protest...* **"..."** *Taking a deep breath, she continued to follow the coordinates.*]

The dynamic duo came across the intersection of the alleyway and the four-lane road which was partitioned by concrete divider that splits the four lanes into two. On the other side, the alleyway picks back up and vanishes into a myriad of things from dumpsters, some amounts of trash, and straggling people.

 The direction in which the truck came from would lead them back to the border, more specifically, the checkpoint that separates the two sides. Further down that side of the road Cat and Cole could potentially see that there was a major shakedown underway. Traffic blocked off and stopped, leaving the road abandoned saved for that armored truck that just passed them. Two more of those armored trucks sat idle beside one another, blocking both lanes of travel that led in their direction. Aside the trucks were at least a dozen people, lined up against the adjacent building's wall or the concrete barrier, being searched, ordered around, and loaded up into the trucks even.

Turning your attention down the other side of travel, they could see the truck going down the road until it came across an intersection which was being enforced by more Legionaries. Whatever was going on, was huge in scale compared to what they had experienced thus far. That truck that left the area made a left, vanishing beyond the corner of a building nestling against the intersection.

*Everywhere you looked, you could find a legionnaire it seemed. Just yesterday, Cat had never even heard of these super soldiers, and now you couldn't walk two feet without bumping into at least one or a dozen - or one of their trucks. Couple that with the looming threat of Corpo Doomsday and...*

*She could feel a shift in the air, a tension that - while maybe was in the air before - wasn't as bad as it was now, and it was only getting worse with each passing hour. She had no clue what the Vesperian Legion had planned prior to the bombing, and she had no desire to stick around to find out. For now, she continued to guide Cole to the P.O. box, sticking to the shadows, remaining obsolete. The quicker they get this over with, the quicker they can get the hell out of dodge, and hopefully find something to help Paige and Grace.*

The duo was at a crossroad. Either they turned around to find another route towards the P.O. Box, finding a alternative route that is safer, but would take longer. Or, attempt to cross the street which is open and potentially get to their destination in a good amount of time.


[5/21/2025 3:37 PM] Cat Bayes
*Well shit, this was quite the conundrum, huh? Uhhh...okay, we can figure this out, no problem! At the moment, time wasn't really their friend, especially not with the rising tension and the soon-to-be scorched earth that is District 9, but was the fate of the entire world really dependent on whether or not they'd be caught j-walking?*

*...Okay, this is dumb as hell. Giving a shrug to Cole, Cat adjusted her hoodie and checked to see if there were either any cars coming or a legionnaire watching...and booked it across the street!*


[5/21/2025 3:47 PM] Cole Mercer
*Cole let out a slow, tired sigh, less from exertion and more from the sheer absurdity of the situation. Without a word, he picked up the pace and followed her across the street, boots hitting the pavement with strides.*

The moment Cat Bayes' sneakers hit the pavement, one of the legionnaire caught sight of her and soon to be Cole dashing across the vacant street. He was one from the outer-most group of their contengiency, holding security for his collegues business.

Their sudden appearance alarmed the soldier, his joints stiffening and his glowing red eyes locked onto the two sprinting individuals. There were people who were weaseling their way through their perimeter! Surely, this was a concern for him and he was authorized by his betters to shoot-on-sight any who are and could pose a threat to their operations within the district.

The soldier rose his weapon, taking aim on the lead sprinter, Cat until one of the detained subjects shoved him with a lowered shoulder, prompting the soldier to lose his sight-picture and stumble into the side of the truck, sprawling him against the ground.

The other legionaries were dealing with an escalating situation as the detained were growing combative. This resulted in the immediate and swift beating of the citizens. Nightsticks charged with electricity were utilized, causing the victims immense pain for their refusal of the law placed upon them.

Cat and Cole made it across the street, this time.

*With the worst of it behind them. Cat and Cole finally made it to the post office that was right on the corner of Newberry and Madison. The foot traffic within the commercial building was mild, with those coming and going in a chaotic symphony that remained true to its normal. Chutes located on the second and third floors were for drones acting as couriers, which would take just-delivered parcels and go out throughout the district.*

*Legionaries were stationed further down Madison, to their immediate left, immersed in a frisk and seizure procedure targeting citizens who had fallen under their scrutiny. Cat and Cole entered the building, and the atmosphere was permeated with the thick aroma of motor lubricant for the drones and the general allocation of everything that may be shipped and received. A self-service kiosk was made available to the pair once they got into one of the many lines. A mascot is a chibi version of one of the parcel drones, giving a thumbs-up to anyone who interfaces with it. The Kiosk displayed several options to them alongside an audio message.*

**"Welcome to Jutar Parcel Services LLC! Are you receiving or sending?"** *It inquired, the options illuminating, signaling them to make a choice.*

 **"Umm...I'll be sending, thanks."** *Cat approached the terminal, clearing her throat. The whole situation with the legionaries was admittedly making her a tad anxious.*

 *The tablet was still kept safe in her jacket pockets, hands clutching the edges of it's frame through the nylon fabric. Carefully pulling it out, she pressed the `Send` button on the console.*


[9/15/2025 4:26 PM] Narration
*At the precise moment Cat engaged with the GUI, a hatch door located at the base of the terminal smoothly opened, lightly bouncing at the limits of its hinge. For those unprepared, this unexpected movement might induce a brief moment of surprise. However, it quickly became clear that the hatch simply provided access to a container intended for placing items within, used a container to put good into.*

**"To send your package, please place it in the drawer located below. After you have secured your parcel, kindly enter the destination address where you would like it to be delivered. Please note that Jutar Parcel Services LLC has a strict policy against shipping contraband items, which include but are not limited to guns, explosives, excessive ink, and any devices that contains pointed language referring to government entities. Thank you for your understanding."**

*A holographic keyboard surfaced for Cat to interact with. (To enter the address, of course.)*


[9/15/2025 7:50 PM] Cole Mercer
*He remained motionless, his empty eyes fixed on the opened hatch door. The slight bounce of the hinge did nothing to stir him. He stayed quiet, unmoving in the face of the machine’s instructions. Not a single thought revealed itself upon his expression.*

[9/15/2025 8:38 PM] Cat Bayes
**"Oop-"** *As expected, Cat wasn't prepared for the hatch to suddenly open beneath her, the sound of the hinges bouncing past their limit surprising and making her take a step back to investigate.*

*Oh, it was just the delivery hatch, gotcha. She knew that, of course.*

*Walking back up to the terminal, she gave the tablet one last look before sliding it into the tray, typing away on the holographic keyboard afterwards: 51124 Alloway St. She only hoped the message was delivered and they were able to escape...*


[9/15/2025 8:50 PM] Narration
*The hatch closed quickly along side the holographic keyboard flickering out of existence. The mascot on screen enlarged and dominated the center of the display, giving a over-exaggerated thumbs up and an equally annoying message.*

**"Thank you for selecting Jutar Parcel Services LLC. Our records confirm that this parcel has already been paid for by...

*Hm, charming.*

*She glanced over towards Cole with a nod. They were finished here, and could now move on.*


[9/15/2025 8:55 PM] Cole Mercer
*Cole turned away from the terminal and began walking back, his gaze sweeping over his surroundings, carefully. Any lingering thoughts of the parcel were discarded as he quickly refocused on the priority of his mission.*


[9/15/2025 8:57 PM] Cat Bayes
*Like always, Cat remained in Cole Mercer's shadow, eyes prowling the net for unseen watchers.*

*And perhaps checking on that parcel now and again...don't need Dylan's name tripping any alarms with the authorities.*


[9/15/2025 9:27 PM] Narration
*As Cole turned around to survey his surroundings, he could hear the distinguishable sound of an armored vehicle rolling up from Madison. Those Legionaries who were frisking and seizing people moments ago were now mobilizing and crossing the intersection; the infantry on the ground actively stopped traffic to allow their armored personnel carrier to cross without having to wait for these obnoxious traffic signals. All of this was visible through the glass windows of the establishment. Those who were around them also took time to rubberneck and watch as those dogs paraded their authority down the avenue. Things were heating up, and that was for sure.*


[9/15/2025 9:41 PM] Cole Mercer
*He briefly placed his hand on the grip of his new silenced pistol, the holster keeping it secure beneath his black overcoat as he checked its readiness in case things boiled over. He scanned the street once more, eyes calculating escape routes and chokepoints with haste. Then he turned to Cat and delivered his message in a clipped tone.* **“We move to the target’s location, close as we can, and extract only actionable intelligence to keep the operation clean. No sidetracks, no improvisation, maintain cover and report anything you find suspicious.”**


[9/15/2025 9:44 PM] Cat Bayes
*The passing trucks made Cat tense up for a moment, briefly remembering the gunfire in the alley way prior to this. Her tongue clicked in frustration and annoyance, before a sigh passed through her lips.*

*Part of her wanted to argue with Cole on this matter - there were still other things to attend to, like Paige and Grace's medicine ... but he was right. The situation was too dire, and every moment spent on the streets was just an elevated chance to get domed by a stray bullet. There will be time to scavenge, but for now, they had to focus on the mission at hand.*

*She turned, nodding up to her partner.* **"I'll follow your lead, watch your back."**
