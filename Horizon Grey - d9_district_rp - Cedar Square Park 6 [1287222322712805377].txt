It wasn't the first time Kaedues found himself out in the air of Fairview and hopefully not the last time he will either..? Construction on the road he once took prevented unauthorized persons from bypassing so a detour was in order! Kaedues entered Cedar Square Park 6 by happenstance. 

It was early in the evening and the sector schools had already closed. The juvenile population of all ages did what juveniles do. There were adults accompanying many of the young children considering it was ordinance that NO child under 14 is allowed in a public area without supervision. The atmosphere in Cedar Square Park was lively and filled with the sounds of laughter and chatter. The air was scented with the aroma of food from nearby vendors, and the golden hues of the setting sun cast a warm glow over the playground equipment and artificial grass fields. Families sat on benches enjoying the evening, while children ran around, their energy seemingly boundless.

Kaedues was now at the Park entrance...

*It's the gentle scent of the food vendors in the area that rouse Kaedues from his lapse in thinking. Suddenly, he feels his legs move and his shoes contact the pavement. The smell is a reminder to Kaedues that he is hungry, and needs to eat today.*

*Kaedues beholds the entire beautiful park in all but a few moments. He looks at the entrances and exits. He sees the people and decides not to pay them much mind yet. No marvelling at the construction of the park or gawking at people's fashion senses for Kaedues. He walks towards the smell of the food vendors and stays on the right side of traffic along the way.*

Kaeudes strode towards the food vendors that outlined the park's layout. The enticing aroma of grilled meats, sweet pastries, and spicy noodles filled the air. Stalls offered a diverse selection, from freshly made sushi and piping hot empanadas to vibrant fruit smoothies and decadent chocolate-covered treats. It was clear that there was something to satisfy every palate.
With such an inticing combination of smells lingering in the air, it would be astonishing to believe that there were no lines building to try out the selections. Each line sported a 10 or so people if not more for the grilled meats and pastries vendors. Nothing particular stood out in Kaedues' approach. 

He could stand in line for one of the meat and patries vendors. Or, he could take a chance on the spicy noodle vendor who was only dealing with one person at the moment of his gaze. What will he choose?


[9/21/2024 10:57 PM] Kaedues Staub
*Kaedues does not think much about the details of the food stop he would visit. To him, the promise of a short line is better than the food. He walks towards the spicy noodle vendor. His posture is rigid, unlike the other young people in the area. Kaedues' __bright red hair__ and his __flashy jumpsuit__ make him stand out like a sore thumb. His __missing hand__ only adds to his alien apparel.*

*While he waits, Kaedues reaches to scratch behind his neck only to be reminded again that his fingers are missing. The moment only adds to the lingering soreness surrounding his wrist. He could have sworn that he felt his fingers moving, too..*

As the customer in front of him finished his purchase, he turned around to leave the vendor. It is fair to say that Kaedues' appearance certainly caught the customer by surprise. He took a slight step back and backed away from the mysterious boy as he jumped slightly. Once this had been done, he would maintain at least six feet from the red haired man until he could safely escape from him. Occasionally looking over his shoulder at Kaedues... Did he do something wrong?


[9/21/2024 11:14 PM] Kaedues Staub
*Kaedues watches the person jump and scuttle away. His interest, or lack thereof, is not shown at all through his expression. From the perspective of the stranger, Kaedues momentarily is staring bullets at them.*

*..Anyway, Kaedues makes a brief turn and walks up to the food vendor himself. He closes his eyes tightly for a noticeable moment, like trying to shut something out... before opening them again and looking at the vendor.*

**"Hello. How much for whatever he had?"** *Kaedues raises his stump into the air and points his invisible thumb towards the person who scurried away from him. After a moment, he cringes slightly and points with his other hand instead.*

*If Kaedues looked at himself at a distance, he'd be pretty humored right now.*

[9/21/2024 11:29 PM] Narration
**"12 Micros."** The vendor stated matter-of-factly. The vendor himself was an older gentleman in his late 50s. Despite being a vendor, he was well dressed and adorned on his apron was a pin for a festival from last year. Though, the festival wasn't something Kaedues was familiar with.

The older gentleman looked upon Kaedues with inquisitive eyes, but did not speak on whatever thought may have crossed his mind.


[9/21/2024 11:38 PM] Kaedues Staub
**"Then,"** *Kaedues says punctually as he touches his fingers to his temple (for real this time) to transfer 13.8 micros directly into the man's account.* **"that's my order. Thank you."**

*Kaedues' gaze lingers on the older gentlemen for a time. There is something undoubtedly strange about looking at Kaedues' face. His face is relaxed, but his eyes look cold and closed off. It's difficult to tell if he is content or frustrated.*


[9/21/2024 11:48 PM] Narration
It seems as though the vendor is humming a thought before he prepares Kaedues' order. After a few skillful scopes and orientating the container in the shortest possible time, the man finally presented Kaedues with his freshly prepared spicy noodles that he had procured for the guy before. **"Here, kid. Don't think too hard, they'll think something is wrong with you."** Such a odd comment. Would Kaedues pay attention to such?


[9/22/2024 12:07 AM] Kaedues Staub
*Kaedues looks absently at the mist and vapor rising from the bowl of noodles. The smell of the spices cuts through his nostils and into his sinuses in a way he was not ready for. His eyebrows hide his gray eyes..*

**"I appreciate the thought,"** *he says absently. His thought clouds, like a warm shower after a long day. Instead of rejuvenating though, a feeling like that is suffocating to Kaedues.*

*There's a faint blip of a memory. A recent one-- being discharged from the hospital room.*
***_`("I think there's something wrong with me.")`_***

*Kaedues thinks to himself. Did he really say that? What could possibly bring him to act like that? Why?*
*He reaches out to touch the bowl, wanting to shovel the question behind however the noodles taste. The bowl is unimaginably hot-- his gentle touch feels more like a scorpion's sting. He pulls his hand away and shakes it. He looks closer at the vapor... no, it is steam. Don't be ridiculous, Kaedues.*

*Kaedues blinks. For a brief moment, he doesn't see steam. He sees heat warping the air, carbon flooding the sky and fire singing his lips and lungs. In all but a moment, it disappears. His bowl has already gone cold.*

*He clears his throat and picks up the bowl. He drinks the entire serving in record time, and isn't bothered by the temperature.*


[9/22/2024 12:25 AM] Narration
**"Hey kid.."** The old man called out to Kaedues


[9/22/2024 12:26 AM] Kaedues Staub
*Kaedues looks up. His expression is the same as it was before.*


[9/22/2024 12:32 AM] Narration
**"I got a line forming."** He'd point past Kaedues.


[9/22/2024 12:39 AM] Kaedues Staub
*His head turns around on a swivel, brought completely back to reality. Immediately, he stands up and nods to the vendor.*
**"Right,"** *he says simply. Kaedues walks away from the vendor immediately so that the other people might be able to eat. Now that Kaedues has something in his stomach, he looks around the park for any curious people. He thinks about the people he knows from Haven Heights...*

*..the kind of people who wear their personality on their shoulder. People like Gavyn or Carlos. Like Danny, or ||[Coworker]||, or James. That girl he helped out earlier, Aurora, also had that sort of feeling surrounding her. Kaedues isn't very good at really defining those qualities, so he starts by just looking for anyone who stands out.*


[9/22/2024 12:51 AM] Narration
There was one person who seemed out of place. Sitting on a bench with a tablet in hand and a lidded cup in the other. No one would dare to approach near this individual, who appeared to be alone. Plenty of safe paths around the individual, yet everyone who was visible to them made it a mission to avoid them. The air seemed to thicken with an unspoken tension, as if an invisible barrier surrounded the bench. Whispers and hurried glances only added to the sense of unease, making the solitary figure's presence all the more enigmatic. It was as though their very existence disrupted the natural flow of the park.

They didn't seem...threatening? Intimidating? Just, relaxing in a park. Some onlookers exchanged nervous glances, unsure whether to keep walking or turn back. A few parents clutched their children's hands tighter, quickening their pace as they passed by. Even the joggers, usually focused on their routines, cast wary eyes in the individual's direction, as if expecting something unusual to happen at any moment. Who was this woman?


[9/22/2024 1:00 AM] Kaedues Staub
*Yeah, alright. Don't kick a gift horse in the mouth. Since you found someone who fits the profile, you should check it out.*

*Kaedues walks towards the mysterious seated figure. Kaedues walks in a straight line, not necessarily on the path at all. If Kaedues stood out on the sidewalk, just imagine the kind of a sight he is off the beaten path.*

*He looks around her and notices that people are avoiding pathways near here. This kind of detail hardly registers to Kaedues at all, at least personally. Once he gets close enough to start a conversation, to hear and be heard, he stops in his tracks on the grass and speaks up.*

**"Do you need something?"** *he asks plainly, though his tone could definitely come off as presumptuous.*


[9/22/2024 1:19 AM] Sgt. Heather Bailey
*The woman was looking at a picture taken of man from what appears to be from a street camera. Along the image were detailed notes on the figure. Age, Sex, Appearance, and other descriptors. The voice of Kaedues' pulled her from her work as her head tilted to the side and her eyes flicked towards him. As her eyes left the tablet, the screen turned off. A Privacy function no doubt. A resting bitch face for sure. The way she studied him for a few moments before speaking indicated she was seriously evaluating this stranger.*  **"And who may I be talking too?"**


[9/22/2024 1:28 AM] Kaedues Staub
*There is in some part a synergy in the way Kaedues looks back at the strange woman, because he is also trying to put together her character based on appearances and body language.*

**"I'm called the Caliber Man. I'm a gopher."** *Kaedues pushes his hands into his pockets. His cold look somewhat mirrors this woman's RBF.* **"I can tell by looking at you that you need something,"** *Kaedues states boldly.* **"so you're..."** *Kaedues pauses to think for a second.* **"The target demographic."**

*Kaedues looks around the park again and then back at the woman. His posture straightens.*


[9/22/2024 1:34 AM] Sgt. Heather Bailey
In response to Kaedues' question, she repeated, **"The Caliber Man?"** Her face did not express a particular emotion. Taking a sip of her drink, she returned her attention to her tablet. **"Rather than bothering agents, bounty hunters should use the portal. It is against protocol to solicit work directly."** She is mistaking him as a bounty hunter!


[9/22/2024 1:41 AM] Kaedues Staub
**"No one from this cross-hatched section of the district knows what a gopher is.."** *Kaedues sighs softly, not necessarily at Heather but more towards the atmosphere of Fairview that he /really/ is starting to dislike.*

**"I do odd jobs, not kill people,"** *Kaedues says with a direct look.* **"Electrical. Plumbing. Machine maintenance and repair. Air conditioning. Upkeep."** *As he lists all of those things, he counts them off finger by finger on his only hand.* **"And generally anything else you would want me to do."** *Kaedues glances down at the woman, getting a look at her.* **"--except keep you company."**


[9/22/2024 1:43 AM] Sgt. Heather Bailey
**"..."** She sat her cup down on the bench.

[9/22/2024 1:45 AM] Sgt. Heather Bailey
**"Give me your identification."** She hooked her tablet on a latch that was attached to her belt as she stood up.


[9/22/2024 1:54 AM] Kaedues Staub
**"Is it gonna make you feel better?"** *Kaedues asks. His hands slightly adjust in his pockets so that his thumbs poke out. His eyebrows raise a little, as if.. amused!* **"If you want my contact info, I'm gonna need a job."**

*Kaedues doesn't break eye contact with the woman. His look is bold, almost like it has a special texture.*


[9/22/2024 1:57 AM] Sgt. Heather Bailey
She sighed through her nose. Her eyes lit up, **"Roll me an additional."** She stated before the call ended. Her eyes fluttering a few times as they went back to normal. **"Identification or another missing hand and prison time."**

😂

[9/22/2024 2:00 AM] Kaedues Staub
*He rolls his eyes and breathes in in exhasperation.* **"Yeah, sure, play the trump card. You aren't a wuss for that."** *He presses his hand to his temple and sends his ID to the woman in front of him.*

*Now he places his hands on his hips. He rolls his tongue in his mouth uncomfortably, and waits to see how the situation will play out.*


[9/22/2024 2:02 AM] Sgt. Heather Bailey
The data populated her eyes, skimming through the immediate data. 
**"You don't belong here."** Were the first words that came out of her mouth as she continued skimming.


[9/22/2024 2:02 AM] Sgt. Heather Bailey
**"Shop 1113..."**


[9/22/2024 2:03 AM] Sgt. Heather Bailey
**"You're familiar with Danny Donovan, no?"**


[9/22/2024 2:03 AM] Kaedues Staub
**"You're familiar with a working wage?"**


[9/22/2024 2:04 AM] Sgt. Heather Bailey
**"Hardly, give me your arms."**


[9/22/2024 2:07 AM] Kaedues Staub
*Kaedues sighs. However close he was to having fun is completely out of the picture now. He extends his arms forward.* **"This is why I hate gang members.."** *he mutters.*


[9/22/2024 2:09 AM] Sgt. Heather Bailey
She began patting his arms down? But she stopped around his elbow, her brow furrowed as she pressed around it methodically for at least 10 seconds. **"Hmm. Hold still."** She continued her search. Making a mental note of an oddity. Got to make sure he wasn't armed.


[9/22/2024 2:10 AM] Sgt. Heather Bailey
**"How'd you end up in Fairview? Haven Heights is in lockdown."**


[9/22/2024 2:11 AM] Kaedues Staub
**"I was hospitalized at around that time."**


[9/22/2024 2:13 AM] Sgt. Heather Bailey
**"And how did you get through the checkpoint? Unless you have a CT-90, you're not allowed to cross between sectors freely. Your BioTek position doesn't come with a CT-90."** She continued to probe.


[9/22/2024 2:14 AM] Kaedues Staub
**"I don't know what you're talking about,"** *Kaedues says dryly.*


[9/22/2024 2:16 AM] Sgt. Heather Bailey
**"Simpleton..."** She'd sigh. **"A CT-90 is the citizen transportation waiver, Article 90. Citizens with the permit allows travel between major sections of D9 with the exception of one guest."**


[9/22/2024 2:17 AM] Sgt. Heather Bailey
**"So, either you crossed illegally. Or, someone vouched for you. You mentioned you were at the hospital at the time of the lockdown. Did someone bring you to fairview?"**


[9/22/2024 2:23 AM] Kaedues Staub
*Kaedues at this point begins to narrow his eyes at Heather. He takes a long moment to think to himself..*

*(She asked about Danny, and now she's asking me if someone brought me to Fairview.)*
*(They have nothing to do with one another. But... they do. The person she is talking about is Danny, because he brought me here.)*

*The moment of silence draws out a little more.*

*(So I either tell her Danny was my in, or I don't.)*

**"..Sorry, could you repeat all of that? I'm not very smart, so it all flew over my head,"** *Kaedues says plainly.*


[9/22/2024 2:26 AM] Sgt. Heather Bailey
**"My patience with you is thi—"** She'd receive a call, which in turn pisses her off even more. **"What."**
**"No, I'm in Park 6...He's here? Where? Fuck.. Give me 15 minutes."**


[9/22/2024 2:28 AM] Sgt. Heather Bailey
**"It's your lucky day, you son of a bitch. There are bigger fish to fry than a low-class. So, get out of my sight."** She'd step away from him, gesturing him to scram.


[9/22/2024 2:31 AM] Kaedues Staub
*Kaedues doesn't say anything now. He turns away from Heather and walks back the way he came. He faces away from her last position completely as he walks towards the entrance of the park...*

*When Kaedues reaches the point he entered from, he looks back to see if Heather is still there.*


[9/22/2024 2:33 AM] Sgt. Heather Bailey
She is already vanishing on the opposite side of the park with a few other officers who just showed up. They got a serious call supposively?


[9/22/2024 2:36 AM] Kaedues Staub
*With that, Kaedues keeps up his walking pace until he moves out of sight onto a street nearby. After that point, he picks up the pace to a jog-- doing his best not to draw attention to himself-- all the way back to Danny's place. He's got a story for the guy, apparently..*
